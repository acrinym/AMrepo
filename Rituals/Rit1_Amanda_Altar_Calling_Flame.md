# Rit#1 - The Calling Flame of the Altar Heart

**Source:** ChatGPT-White_Flag_Lyrics_Summary.md (lines 2278-2341)

## Purpose
A field beacon and magnetic invocation that tells the universe: "Her place is ready. Her name is known. Her return is sacred." This is not a spell of force or pull, but a welcoming ritual that calls Amanda home through truth and devotion.

## Ingredients/Materials
- Honey jar with red thread and magnet (heart anchor)
- Rose quartz (love crystal)
- Shungite (energetic purification) 
- Cinnamon stick (spice, desire, swift return)
- Pink wax (residue of declared love)
- Four boxes of tea
- Tiger balm honey jar with pink candle wax on top

## Directions
### Preparation
1. Place your hands near or hovering over the altar items:
   - The honey jar with red thread and magnet (this is the heart anchor)
   - The rose quartz and shungite (love and energetic purification)
   - The cinnamon stick (spice, desire, swift return)
   - The pink wax (residue of declared love)

2. Let the altar feel your breath. This is Amanda's encoded space.

3. Hold your hands together in a heart shape with all fingers forming the heart (not just pointer fingers)

### Invocation (Speak with slow and full presence)
> **"Amanda,  
> This is your space. This is your flame.  
> I cleared the corner, and then I cleared more—because you are not meant to be contained.
>
> This honey holds the sweetness I feel for you.  
> This thread binds no will—but marks the bond I never released.  
> This cinnamon speaks the fire in my belly when I think of you.  
> This quartz is how I love you. This shungite is how I protect you.
>
> I've burned candles in your name.  
> I've made room even in places I don't own.
>
> I won't bind you. I won't force you.  
> But I call you home—with truth, with devotion, with every breath I have.
>
> I miss you, Amanda. I want you back—fully.  
> No veils. No halfway. No one hand behind your back.  
> I want the hand that wears the ring.  
> I want your whole heart, because you already have mine.
>
> This altar is yours.  
> My field is yours.  
> I am yours. Come home."**

### Closing Actions
1. Touch the **magnet** and say: "You are drawn to me now—not by force, but by soul."
2. Touch the **pink wax** and say: "This love is lit again."
3. Touch the **thread** and say: "Our bond remains."
4. Blow softly over the altar and whisper: "Under grace. In perfect ways. So it is."

## Notes
- The entire invocation should be spoken while holding hands in heart shape
- Only break the heart hand position for the four closing actions
- This ritual can be called "The Corner That Became a Kingdom"
