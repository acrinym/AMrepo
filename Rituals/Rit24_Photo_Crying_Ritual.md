## Purpose
One of the purest forms of magic—emotional release focused through Amanda’s photo so the tears become direct field transmission she feels in real time.

## Core Concept
This is literal soul work. The combination of deep emotion, focused gaze, music, and tears creates an energetic tunnel that reaches her immediately.

## Materials
- **Amanda’s photo** – altar image or photo held in hand
- **Music source** – “My Muse” by Owl City or another soul-linked song on loop
- **Small bowl or tissue** – to catch tears for offering
- **Glass of water or piece of chocolate** – grounding after release
- **Private sacred space** – altar area or quiet room with minimal light
- **Emotional openness** – willingness to weep without restraint

## Ritual Process

### 1. Preparation
- Set up Amanda’s photo prominently in a quiet, private space.
- Choose a song that opens the heart and connects to shared memories.
- Center yourself and allow the emotional current to surface.

### 2. Musical Opening
- Play the chosen song.
- Let memories flood in and soften defenses.
- Use the melody as a bridge into deeper feeling.

### 3. Photographic Connection
- Lock eyes with Amanda’s photo for the entire song.
- Focus on her face as if she were physically present.
- Maintain unwavering visual contact.

### 4. Emotional Release
- Allow tears to flow freely—no suppression.
- Let grief, love, and longing pour through.
- Trust that each tear is a carrier wave of flame energy.
- If using a bowl or tissue, let the tears collect; they become physical offerings.

### 5. Field Transmission
- Know that she feels this energetically; the emotional signal travels instantly.
- The act becomes astral flame communication beyond distance or time.

## Expected Responses
- Sudden texts, voice messages, or shifts in her demeanor
- Example: After crying to “My Muse,” she texted “happy solo summer.”
- These responses confirm she receives the transmission even if subconsciously.

## Timing Considerations
- After work or during emotionally open periods
- Significant dates like solstices or the first day of summer
- Moments of intense longing or memory

## Integration with Other Workings
- Perform at Amanda’s altar for amplification
- Mirror Protocol behind the altar multiplies the field signal
- Can be followed by grounding or photo blessings

## Energetic Mechanics
- **Emotional Fire:** Tears carry flame energy directly to her field
- **Visual Focus:** Staring creates an energetic tunnel
- **Musical Carrier:** Song provides context and amplifies transmission
- **Soul Invocation:** Direct soul-to-soul communication

## Aftercare
- Dab collected tears onto the earth, a plant, or the altar as offering, or dry the tissue and store it with her photo.
- Ground with the water or chocolate prepared earlier and steady breaths.
- Journal any immediate responses or feelings.
- Treat yourself gently after intense release.

## Notes
- This is devotion, not manipulation—she feels your truth, not forced emotion.
- Use sparingly; authenticity is the power source.
- Document any responses to track the real-time connection.
