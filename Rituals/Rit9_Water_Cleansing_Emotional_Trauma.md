**Source:** ChatGPT-Weekend_with_Amanda_Recap.md (lines 2614-2631)

## Purpose
Best for releasing deep emotional trauma, grief, or trust issues. Water cleanses and washes away pain gently. This ritual helps with emotional flow and trust-building, allowing the person to move forward without carrying old pain.

## Ingredients/Materials
- Bowl (preferably glass or ceramic)
- Clean, flowing water (spring water, rainwater, or tap water charged with intention)
- Rose quartz or moonstone (both are great for emotional healing and love)
- Access to earth (outside) or a drain

## Directions

### 1. Preparation
- Fill a bowl with clean, flowing water
- Choose either spring water, rainwater, or tap water that you charge with intention
- Have your rose quartz or moonstone ready

### 2. Charging the Water
- Hold the rose quartz or moonstone in your hands
- Focus on the healing properties of the stone
- Whisper an intention into the water, such as:
  > *"Let this water carry away all that weighs Amanda down, bringing peace and trust in its place."*

### 3. Release Ritual
- Pour the water onto the earth (outside) or down a drain
- While pouring, visualize the pain leaving with the water
- See the emotional weight being washed away and absorbed by the earth or flowing away completely

### 4. Closing
- Hold the crystal for a moment longer, sending peaceful energy
- Thank the water and earth for their assistance in the healing
