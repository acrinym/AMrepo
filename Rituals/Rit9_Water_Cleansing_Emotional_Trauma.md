## Ingredients/Materials

## Directions

### 1. Preparation
- Fill a bowl with clean, flowing water
- Choose either spring water, rainwater, or tap water that you charge with intention
- Have your rose quartz or moonstone ready

### 2. Charging the Water
- Hold the rose quartz or moonstone in your hands
- Focus on the healing properties of the stone
- Whisper an intention into the water, such as:
  > *"Let this water carry away all that weighs Amanda down, bringing peace and trust in its place."*

### 3. Release Ritual
- Pour the water onto the earth (outside) or down a drain
- While pouring, visualize the pain leaving with the water
- See the emotional weight being washed away and absorbed by the earth or flowing away completely
