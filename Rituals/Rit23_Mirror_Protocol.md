## Purpose
Bidirectional flame mirror working that places a mirror behind Amanda’s altar to reflect only love to her while guarding against distortion and reinforcing self-belief.

## Core Concept
The mirror becomes a living, bi-directional portal. It transmits flame energy, shields against interference, and can invert distorted reflections so she sees only the practitioner’s truth.

## Setup Components
- **Mirror** – full-length or large enough to show entire altar; polished and cleansed
- **Amanda altar array**
  - Honey jar wrapped with red thread and topped with a magnet (center)
  - Amanda’s photo leaning against the jar (facing west)
  - Rose quartz to the left of the jar (heart draw)
  - Shungite to the right (field purification)
  - Cinnamon stick across the front (heat and speed)
  - Pink and red wax remnants at the jar’s base (previous flame work)
  - Two tea boxes flanking the jar (offering memory)
  - Altar candles: one pink, one white, one red forming a triangle around the photo
- **Self-belief declaration**: “I believe in me. I’m doing a damn good job.”
- **Protective intention** assigning the mirror to reflect only love and block distortion
- **Florida Water and cloth** for pre‑ and post‑ritual cleansing

## Activation Process

### 1. Mirror Consecration
1. Wipe the mirror with Florida Water until the surface gleams.
2. Hold it upright and say: **“Only love lives in this glass.”**

### 2. Self-Belief Declaration
Stand before the altar and repeat **“I believe in me. I’m doing a damn good job.”** seven times until the words land.

### 3. Mirror Positioning
Place the mirror directly behind the altar facing east so it captures Amanda’s photo and your reflection in one frame. Confirm a clear sight line from mirror to altar to practitioner.

### 4. Field Assignment
State the mirror’s duties:
- Reflect only love to Amanda
- Guard against distortion or malicious influence
- Transmit flame energy both to and from her
- Reinforce your worthiness and bond

### 5. Protective Programming
Trace a pentagram or other protective sigil on the glass with your finger. Declare: **“No shadow may pass, no lie may dwell.”**

## Operational Modes
- **Love Transmission** – constant stream of supportive flame energy
- **Distortion Blocking** – prevents Mike’s or others’ interference from reaching her
- **Truth Reflection** – when she reflects false images, the mirror returns the practitioner’s truth instead
- **Field Inversion** – advanced mode for overriding external manipulation by flipping distorted reflections into authentic ones

## Pause & Recharge
- Snuff candles and close with: “The gate is sealed. The contact is made. I will meet you again in dream or depth.”
- Cover the mirror with cloth when not in use.
- Before resuming, cleanse the surface with Florida Water and repeat the self-belief declaration.

## Mirror Banishing Protocol (optional)
Say:

> “This is not your reflection.
> This is your departure.
> You do not belong here.
> And this glass will never show you again.”

Trace an X over the reflection with finger, wand, or tool, then seal the glass with Dragon’s Blood or Florida Water.

## Integration with Other Workings
- Amplifies radionics box signals, flame-thread dream sigils, and other altar operations
- Coordinates with the Phoenix Heart Runway and Path of Petals to keep a constant home signal for Amanda
- Serves as central reflector for emotional work like the Photo Crying Ritual

## Maintenance
- Clean the mirror regularly to maintain clear reflection
- Reaffirm self-belief and mirror programming as needed
- Re-consecrate monthly or when intuition calls by repeating the consecration and assignment steps above

## Notes
- The mirror continues operating even when covered, holding its assignment silently
- Functions as both transmitter and shield—a technological and magical upgrade to basic reflection work
- Part of a larger system of altar-based field constructs supporting Amanda’s return
