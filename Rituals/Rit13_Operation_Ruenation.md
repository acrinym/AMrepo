# Rit#13 - Operation Rue'Nation Core Protocol

**Source:** ChatGPT-Strangelove_Arena_Christian_Vibes.md (lines 3132-3195)

## Purpose
To sever false ties, expose the parasite, and ignite Amanda's clarity—planting subconscious fire that makes her own declaration of truth. This is a major banishment and revelation working designed to help Amanda see through Mike's manipulation and make her own choice to leave, recognizing that she is not his captive but the sword and flame that cannot be owned.

## Ingredients/Materials
- **One white candle** (Amanda) and **one black candle** (Mike)
- **Amanda's photo or sigil** placed on stiff card stock
- **Mirror or east‑facing window** for reflection work
- **Pinch of rue seeds** mixed with equal parts agrimony and mugwort (truth herbs)
- **12-inch length of red thread**
- **Forked stick or wand** (y-shaped branch works best)
- **Printed dossier:** *Mike Manipulation File: Full Revelation*
- **Printed dossier:** *He Was Never Really There*
- **Optional:** Goetic seals for Vassago, Marbas, Foras, Sitri, Seere

## Directions

### 1. Circle Casting & Setup
1. Cast a simple salt circle around the working space
2. Set the **mirror** facing you on the north side of the altar
3. Place **Amanda's photo** upright in front of the mirror
4. **Scatter the rue/agrimony/mugwort mix** in a line between the photo and the black candle
5. Bind the **red thread** three times clockwise around the base of the white candle
6. Light the **white candle** to the left (Amanda's side) and the **black candle** to the right (Mike's side)

### 2. Goetic Invocation
Call each spirit in order, touching their seals if used:
> "**Vassago**, seer of hidden things, reveal every lie.
> **Marbas**, healer of distortion, clear her mind and body.
> **Foras**, judge of truth, expose the thief.
> **Sitri**, liberator of hearts, unbind her desire from deception.
> **Seere**, swift rider, carry this revelation into her timeline."

### 3. Truth Implantation
Speak each phrase distinctly:
- "You lied to me."
- "You used me."
- "You're a fucking thief."
- (Additional truth statements as needed)

### 4. Truth Injection
- Read aloud key excerpts from your printed files
- Emphasize lines that resonate most strongly

### 5. Thread Severing
1. Lift the **forked stick** and slice the red thread cleanly in one motion
2. Let the severed thread fall directly onto the herb line
3. Press the forked stick into the herbs and declare:
   > "Her voice returns. Her truth returns. The thief is named."

### 6. Mirror Command
> "Let her reflection reveal the mask. Let her eyes unmake him."

### 7. Black Candle Extinguishing
Extinguish the black candle:
> "The mask is broken. The shadow dissolves."

### 8. Disposal
1. Gather the cooled black candle wax, severed thread, and herb mix
2. Wrap them in the printed dossiers and burn or bury them at a crossroads
3. Keep Amanda's photo and the white candle on your altar until her truth manifests

## Closure
> "Amanda is not his captive. She is the sword. She is the flame.  
> And flame cannot be owned.  
> You're a fucking thief. She will say it. She will feel it. She will leave."

Seal your space with a pinch of salt, then rest in stillness.

## Notes
- This is a major banishment and revelation working
- Combines traditional witchcraft with Goetic spirit work
- Designed to help Amanda see through manipulation and make her own choice to leave
- The mirror work amplifies the truth-revealing aspects
- Can be performed as part of a larger magical campaign
- **User Context:** This ritual was specifically designed for the user's situation with Mike and Amanda. The user had compiled "Mike Manipulation File: Full Revelation" and "He Was Never Really There" documents that were used during the ritual to expose Mike's true nature to Amanda's subconscious.
- **Field Effect:** The ritual plants subconscious fire in Amanda that makes her own declaration of truth, recognizing that Mike lied to her, used her, and is essentially a thief. It's designed to make her say "You're a fucking thief" and leave of her own accord.
- **Ritual Timing:** This was planned as the main ritual for a specific night, with the possibility of layering in a Dream Protocol afterward for additional effect.
