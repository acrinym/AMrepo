# Unperformed Rituals & Spells

This document catalogs magical workings that were planned, designed, or considered but **NOT performed** for various strategic, ethical, or practical reasons.

## High-Risk Spirits - Deliberately Avoided

### **Beelzebub Working**
- **Status:** NOT CALLED - "He won't mess around"
- **Reason for Avoidance:** Too powerful and unpredictable for current objectives
- **Alternative Chosen:** Other Goetic spirits with more manageable energy signatures

### **Beelzekuth Invocation**
- **Status:** Referenced but not performed
- **Description:** "Commander forged from Beelzebub's cunning and stormfire of wrath"
- **Domain:** Dominion over swarm logic, psychic pressure, divine enforcement through infernal intelligence
- **Reason for Restraint:** Too intense for current magical objectives

## Physical Manifestation Workings - Postponed

### **Physical Manifestations at Mike's House**
- **Purpose:** Calling visible spiritual entities to appear at Mike's property
- **Status:** Planned but not executed
- **Reason:** Too aggressive and potentially harmful

### **Entity Summoning for Physical Appearance**
- **Target Location:** Mike's house and property
- **Intent:** Create visible supernatural phenomena to drive Mike away
- **Status:** Designed but not implemented

## Unperformed Mike Elimination Spells

### **Three Major Spells Held in Reserve**
**Status:** "Three spells that I have not performed yet"

#### **1. Mike Be Gone Powder**
- **Concept:** Mike's name burned to ash, mixed with hot foot powder, black salt, and banishing oil
- **Application:** Simply placing the powder would activate the spell
- **Status:** Conceptualized but not created
- **Reason:** Other methods proving effective

#### **2. Road Crossing Mirror Spell**
- **Design:** Dual mirrors placed across from each side of road, facing each other
- **Effect:** Each car driving over causes Mike to remember harmful things he's done
- **Location Requirements:** Road, highway, or bridge access needed
- **Status:** Planned but not executed
- **Challenges:** Logistics of mirror placement and location access

#### **3. Voice Burial Box Spell**
- **Method:** Recording Mike's voice, placing device in destructive box underground
- **Concept:** "If it's in a box underground he can never get it back"
- **Effect:** Complete voice removal/silencing
- **Status:** Designed but not implemented
- **Restraint:** Potentially too severe

### **Bring the Pain Back Ritual**
- **Purpose:** Return all pain Mike has caused back to him
- **Mechanism:** Karmic reflection and justice working
- **Status:** Planned but not performed

## Advanced Workings - Held for Strategic Timing

### **Summoning Entity/Servitor Hybrid on Mike**

- **Power Level:** Described as serious escalation beyond current workings
- **Status:** Planned contingency - "things I would do if he doesn't get the fuck out of the way"

### **Complete Hot Foot House Application**
- **Scope:** Around Mike's house and driveway
- **Effect:** Prevent Amanda from ever entering his space again
- **Timing Requirement:** Must ensure Amanda isn't present during casting
- **Status:** Prepared but waiting for clear opportunity

## Ethical Restraints & Strategic Decisions

### **Reasons for Non-Performance**
1. **Escalation Management:** Reserving more powerful workings as needed
2. **Ethical Boundaries:** Avoiding workings that cross into harmful territory
3. **Strategic Timing:** Waiting for optimal moments for maximum effectiveness
4. **Risk Assessment:** Some workings deemed too dangerous or unpredictable
5. **Effectiveness Monitoring:** Current workings showing results, making escalation unnecessary

### **Alternative Approaches Chosen**
- **Subtler Energetic Work:** Preference for invisible spiritual pressure
- **Protective vs. Harmful:** Focus on protecting Amanda rather than harming Mike
- **Gradual Pressure:** Building effects through multiple smaller workings
- **Reversible Methods:** Choosing workings that can be undone if needed

## Strategic Value of Unperformed Workings

- Creates graduated response capability
