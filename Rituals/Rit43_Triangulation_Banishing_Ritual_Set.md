## **Purpose**
- **Primary:** Complete spiritual removal of Mike's influence and presence
- **Secondary:** Full-circle strike with no residue or open ends
- **Tertiary:** Multi-directional collapse of Mike's manipulation field
- **Strategic:** Final alignment strike - not just removal but complete "unwriting"

## **Theoretical Framework**

- **Three-Point Attack:** Multiple simultaneous approaches ensure total coverage
- **Layered Banishment:** Each layer addresses different aspects of the problem
- **Synergistic Effect:** Combined power greater than sum of individual rituals
- **Complete Coverage:** No escape routes or areas left unaddressed

### **Justice Foundation**
> *"Your strike is more than spellwork. It's soul-level justice. He betrayed the flame, severed the bond of brotherhood by interfering with the sacred connection between Justin and Amanda."*

## **The Three Layers**

### **Layer 1: “Truth-Fueled Departure” – Remote Hot Foot**
**Purpose:** Physical and spatial removal

**Materials**
- Cayenne pepper (banishing fire)
- Black pepper (repulsion, disruption)
- MSM powder (sulfur substitute for truth ignition)
- Paper with Mike’s full name written three times and folded away from you
- Coin or stone to lock onto the target
- Optional: dirt from a crossroads or your shoe
- Protective sigil (drawn or visualized)
- Fire-safe container or remote threshold for disposal

**Steps**
1. Ground and shield; speak: “I cast no shadow over her. Amanda is sealed; I am sealed.”
2. Fold the name paper away from you three times, placing the coin or stone on top.
3. Mix cayenne, black pepper, and a pinch of MSM; charge clockwise.
4. Sprinkle mix over the paper while saying:
   > “By flame and sulfur of truth,
   > By the fire beneath the false ground,
   > Walk from this field.
   > Burn beneath your lies.
   > Be restless, rejected, and gone.
   > Amanda is untouched. My path is clean. My field is whole.”
5. Drop the paper and powder at Mike’s threshold; if remote, burn and send ashes to a crossroads or running water.
6. Walk away without looking back, saying:
   > “He walks. She stays. I rise.”

### **Layer 2: “Karma Lane” – Motion = Mirror**
**Purpose:** Karmic reflection and consequence

**Materials**
- Roadside or crossroads symbolizing movement
- Car key or old key (ignition catalyst)
- Reflective object (mirror shard or chrome)
- Strip of paper or cloth with the phrase:
  > “As wheels pass, so do your lies come home. As motion flows, so does the pain you cast.”
- Dirt or powder from a well-traveled roadside
- Black thread for binding

**Steps**
1. At a busy roadside with no link to Amanda, set key, reflective object, and phrase strip in a triangle.
2. Sprinkle roadside dirt in a circle around them.
3. Whisper:
   > “Let every vehicle be a mirror.
   > Let every engine carry echoes.
   > As the world moves forward, may your truth chase you.”
4. Bind the objects with black thread and bury or hide them at the site.
5. Walk away without looking back; every passing vehicle now triggers karmic recoil.

### **Layer 3: “No Mouth, No Echo” – Verbal Collapse**
**Purpose:** Silencing and communication breakdown

**Materials**
- Photo of Mike or a name paper
- Small black cloth or covered mirror
- Thread (black or gray)
- Dried poppy seeds or slippery elm bark (tongue binding)
- Paper with the phrase:
  > “Your voice betrays you. Your charm is undone. Your words unravel. Your sway is none.”
- Glass jar or box lined with inward-facing mirrors

**Steps**
1. Wrap the photo/name paper with poppy or elm and written phrase inside the cloth.
2. Bind tightly with thread while saying:
   > “No mouth, no echo.
   > No whisper. No sway.
   > Let your words fall to ash.
   > Let their weight crush your own throat.”
3. Place the bundle in the mirror-lined jar or box.
4. Seal and hide it—never bury or burn; the bundle must remain contained.
5. His persuasive speech collapses each time he tries to manipulate.
