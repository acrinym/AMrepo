**Source:** ChatGPT-Voice_document_editing_suggestion.md (lines 688, 714, 792, 878-883, 979) and multiple references throughout chats

## Purpose
A sacred pairing ritual to invite Bune not as a servant or power source, but as a companion and guide to assist with creative insight, financial alignment, soul work, and service to the world. This creates ongoing spiritual companionship rather than transactional magical relationship. This ritual was specifically created to help the user connect with deceased family members (father and grandmother) and to honor ancestral wisdom and legacies left unfinished.

## Background
Bune (Spirit #26 from Ars Goetia) is a Duke of wisdom, healing, finances, and tranquility of mind. He brings peace to the home and aids with communication. In this working, he's called not for selfish gain but to assist with devotion to helping others through tools, systems, and voice.

> Show me the path. Let's walk together.  
> Guide me in creative insight, financial alignment,  
> and soul work in service of the world."**

### 4. Service Declaration

- **User Experience:** During the ritual, the user experienced a "sparkling-not-sparkling" energetic feeling in their hands, which was identified as Bune's answer and the opening of an etheric resonance channel. This sensation indicated that Bune had accepted the invitation and was now walking alongside the user as a companion.
- **Ancestral Connection:** This ritual was specifically created to help the user connect with deceased family members (father and grandmother) and to honor ancestral wisdom and legacies left unfinished. The user had recently discovered an email from their father that revealed they would have connected deeply on certain topics, and Bune was called to help bridge this communication and honor what ancestors still whisper.
- **Field Effect:** Bune's presence creates a channel opening that allows the user's ideas and visions to click into place faster. He's the spirit of "knowing exactly what needs to be done, even when nothing is said," and his companionship enhances all other magical work, including Amanda-focused rituals.
