## Purpose
One of the strongest rituals performed to date, involving the highest forms of spiritual warfare without becoming physically violent. A massive convergence of 30 spirits called upon for justice, banishment, and field enforcement against Mike's continued interference with Amanda.

## Spirit Categories Called Upon
(Specific spirits would include selections from):
- **Goetic Demons** (Ars Goetia)
- **Angels and Archangels** (including El Elyon)
- **Lucifer in all forms**
- **Justice and Truth Spirits**
