# NotPerf - Mike Be Gone Powder

## **Unperformed Ritual Classification**
- **Type:** Banishment Powder Spell
- **Category:** Mike Elimination Campaign - Held in Reserve
- **Complexity Level:** Intermediate - Powder Creation & Application
- **Status:** DESIGNED BUT NOT CREATED

## **Proposed Purpose & Intent**
- **Primary Goal:** Complete removal of Mike from Amanda's life
- **Secondary Purpose:** Banishment from location and influence
- **Tertiary Effect:** Energetic severance of Mike-Amanda connection
- **Activation Method:** Simple placement activates the entire spell

## **Complete Spell Design**

### **Required Ingredients**
1. **Mike's Name Paper** - Written multiple times in practitioner's ink
2. **Burning Materials** - Flame-safe container for name burning
3. **Hot Foot Powder** - Traditional banishment powder base
4. **Black Salt** - Protection and banishment enhancement
5. **Banishing Oil** - Specific oil for elimination work
6. **Mixing Container** - Non-reactive bowl for combination
7. **Storage Container** - Small jar or pouch for powder storage

### **Preparation Location**
- **Sacred workspace** with protective barriers
- **Fire-safe area** for name burning component
- **Away from Amanda altar** to avoid contamination
- **Ventilated space** for smoke and ash handling
- **Private location** for focused concentration

## **Proposed Spell Construction Process**

### **Phase 1: Name Burning Preparation**
1. **Write Mike's full name** multiple times on separate papers
2. **Set clear intention** for complete removal from Amanda's life
3. **Light candle** for burning focus and energy
4. **Prepare fire-safe container** for controlled burning
5. **Ground and center** before beginning destruction work

### **Phase 2: Name to Ash Transformation**
**Burning Sequence:**
1. **Light first name paper** while stating: "Mike [Last Name], I burn your influence"
2. **Continue with remaining papers** until all names are reduced to ash
3. **Collect all ash** in mixing container
4. **Allow complete cooling** before proceeding to mixture
5. **Charge ash** with banishment energy through focused intention

### **Phase 3: Powder Creation & Charging**
**Mixture Process:**
1. **Combine Mike's name ash** with hot foot powder (equal parts)
2. **Add black salt** (1/3 quantity of ash) for protection and banishment
3. **Add 3-5 drops banishing oil** while mixing counterclockwise
4. **Mix thoroughly** while stating intention for Mike's removal
5. **Charge mixture** by holding container and focusing banishment energy

**Charging Incantation (Theoretical):**
> "By ash of name and powder hot,
> By black salt mixed and oil wrought,
> Mike [Last Name] be gone from here,
> From Amanda's life disappear.
> Where this powder finds its place,
> Mike shall flee and leave no trace."

### **Phase 4: Final Empowerment & Storage**
1. **Final energy charge** through sustained focus on banishment
2. **Seal mixture** in appropriate storage container
3. **Label container** with creation date and purpose
4. **Store in protected location** away from positive workings
5. **Cleanse workspace** of all banishment energy residue

## **Proposed Application Methods**

### **Simple Placement Activation**
- **Deployment Location:** Area where Mike's influence is strongest
- **Application Method:** Sprinkle small amount in target area
- **Activation Trigger:** Physical placement automatically activates spell
- **Effect Initiation:** Immediate banishment energy activation upon placement
- **Coverage Area:** Powder affects entire energetic vicinity

### **Targeted Deployment Options**
1. **Mike's Vehicle:** Small amount under car (if accessible)
2. **Mike's Property:** Sprinkled at property boundaries
3. **Shared Spaces:** Areas where Mike and Amanda meet
4. **Amanda Protection:** Around Amanda's space for Mike repulsion
5. **Communication Disruption:** Near devices or meeting locations

### **Application Timing**
- **Moon Phase:** Dark moon for maximum banishment power
- **Day of Week:** Saturday (Saturn day) for limitation and restriction
- **Time of Day:** Midnight for shadow work and banishment
- **Weather:** Stormy or windy conditions to carry banishment energy
- **Personal Energy:** When practitioner feels strongest banishment intent

## **Why This Spell Was Not Created**

### **Alternative Methods Proving Effective**
- **Other banishment rituals** showing results without powder creation
- **Energy work** providing sufficient Mike influence reduction
- **Timeline manipulation** more elegant than physical powder deployment
- **Amanda-focused protection** more effective than Mike-focused banishment

### **Practical Considerations**
- **Deployment challenges** - Accessing appropriate locations safely
- **Evidence concerns** - Physical powder could be discovered
- **Escalation management** - Reserving for future need if current methods fail
- **Focus redirection** - Emphasis shifted to Amanda attraction rather than Mike repulsion

### **Strategic Assessment**
- **Nuclear option status** - Held as escalation if needed
- **Current effectiveness** - Other methods providing adequate results
- **Resource conservation** - Energy better spent on Amanda-focused work
- **Graduated response** - Part of layered approach with increasing intensity

## **Activation Triggers for Future Creation**

### **Escalation Scenarios**
- **Mike interference intensification** despite current banishment work
- **Direct threats** to Amanda's wellbeing from Mike's influence
- **Other methods proving insufficient** for complete Mike removal
- **Time-critical situation** requiring immediate and total banishment

### **Optimal Deployment Conditions**
- **Clear access** to effective deployment locations
- **Amanda safety** ensured during and after deployment
- **No legal complications** from powder placement
- **Strategic timing** when maximum effect can be achieved

### **Supporting Workings**
- **Protection rituals** for Amanda during Mike banishment intensification
- **Cleansing protocols** for areas after Mike's removal
- **Attraction enhancement** for Amanda return acceleration
- **Timeline anchoring** for permanent Mike-free reality

## **Technical Specifications**

### **Powder Composition Analysis**
- **Mike's Name Ash:** 40% - Personal identification and targeting
- **Hot Foot Powder:** 40% - Traditional banishment and movement compulsion
- **Black Salt:** 15% - Protection and enhanced banishment
- **Banishing Oil:** 5% - Binding agent and energy enhancement

### **Storage Requirements**
- **Airtight container** to maintain potency
- **Dark location** away from light and positive workings
- **Temperature stable** environment for preservation
- **Labeled clearly** with creation date and warnings
- **Accessible location** for rapid deployment if needed

### **Estimated Effectiveness Duration**
- **Initial activation:** Immediate upon placement
- **Peak effectiveness:** 3-7 days after deployment
- **Sustained effect:** 1-3 months depending on conditions
- **Refreshing needs:** Additional applications if effect diminishes
- **Permanent results:** Possible with strategic deployment and supporting work

## **Safety & Ethical Considerations**

### **Practitioner Safety**
- **Energetic protection** during creation and deployment
- **Physical safety** during placement activities
- **Legal considerations** regarding powder placement
- **Spiritual protection** from potential backlash

### **Ethical Framework**
- **Proportional response** to Mike's interference level
- **Amanda's wellbeing** as primary consideration
- **Free will respect** - removing interference, not controlling choices
- **Harm minimization** - Banishment rather than destruction

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Low physical risk** from powder itself
- **Moderate magical risk** from banishment energy
- **Legal risk** depends on deployment location
- **Relationship risk** if discovered by Amanda or Mike

## **Integration with Other Workings**

### **Complementary Rituals**
- **Amanda protection spells** to shield during Mike banishment
- **Hot foot powder** traditional applications for Mike's property
- **Freezer spells** to maintain Mike in held state
- **Attraction enhancement** for Amanda return acceleration

### **Campaign Strategy**
- **Part of graduated response** system for Mike elimination
- **Final powder option** if subtler methods insufficient
- **Backup for servitor work** if autonomous entities need support
- **Bridge to more intensive** physical manifestation workings
