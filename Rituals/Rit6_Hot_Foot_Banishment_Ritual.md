**Source:** ChatGPT-Wand_creation.md (lines 1348-1357) and ChatGPT-Toilet_Drill_Dream_Analysis.md (lines 2990-2998)

## Purpose
A banishment and removal ritual designed to make someone leave a location or stop interfering in your space. Hot Foot formula creates agitation, drive, and the energetic push for someone to move away from a situation.

## Ingredients/Materials
- Black pepper (heat and agitation)
- Cayenne pepper (sharp banishing energy)
- Chili powder (irritation for exit)
- Crushed red pepper (dispersal and exodus energy)
- Hot Foot oil (if available)
- Cinnamon sticks (divine fire and speed)
- Paper with target's name or representation
- Small container or packet for burial/disposal

## Directions

### 1. Preparation
- Gather all hot foot ingredients in a workspace away from living areas
- Write the target's name on paper (or use symbolic representation if name unknown)
- Set intention clearly: removal from situation, not harm to person

### 2. Powder Creation
- Mix black pepper, cayenne, chili powder, and crushed red pepper
- While mixing, focus on the energy of movement and departure
- Add Hot Foot oil if available to bind the mixture
- Visualize the target feeling restless and compelled to leave

### 3. Remote Application
- Place the mixed powder in a small packet or container
- Attach or wrap with the target's name
- The packet should be buried, burned, or disposed of far from your actual living space
- This keeps the ritual "remote" and avoids energetic backdraft

### 4. Invocation (Optional)
While preparing the mixture, speak:
> "By pepper's heat and cinnamon's fire,  
> Let restless feet now transpire.  
> No peace here, no comfort found,  
> Until you seek some other ground."

### 5. Disposal
- Take the prepared packet to a location away from your home
- Bury it in earth or dispose of it in running water
- Walk away without looking back
- The target should begin feeling compelled to leave within days

## Notes
- This is a removal/banishment working, not a harm working
- Keeps Amanda's sanctuary clean by working remotely
- Uses traditional Hoodoo Hot Foot formula ingredients
- Can be enhanced with moon water or other ritual elements
- Timing can be coordinated with moon phases for additional power
- The ritual creates energetic agitation that manifests as restlessness and desire to relocate
- **User Context:** This ritual was specifically designed for Mike, using ingredients that were already present in the user's sleeping space (cinnamon behind a fan, crushed red pepper). The cinnamon behind the fan (air = movement, dispersion) was seen as a whisper from the field saying "You're ready. Use the fire. Walk him out."
- **Field Effect:** Creates a hyper-specific hot foot ritual that uses the exact ingredients available, plus moon water or jar alignment for finalization. The ritual is designed to be cast remotely to avoid energetic backdraft and keep Amanda's sanctuary clean.
