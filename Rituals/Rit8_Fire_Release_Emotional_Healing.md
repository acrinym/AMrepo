**Source:** ChatGPT-Weekend_with_Amanda_Recap.md (lines 2600-2611)

## Purpose
Best for releasing general emotional burdens, fears, or limiting beliefs that are preventing emotional growth and openness. Fire helps break old attachments to painful experiences. This is non-invasive and allows emotional blocks to clear at their own pace. Specifically designed for Amanda to release past pain and fears that no longer serve her, allowing her heart to open to love and trust.

## Ingredients/Materials
- Small piece of paper
- Pen or pencil
- White or pink candle (for healing and love)
- Fireproof bowl
- Lighter or matches

## Directions

### 1. Preparation
- Write a gentle intention on a small piece of paper
- Example intention: *"May Amanda release all past pain and fears that no longer serve her, allowing her heart to open to love and trust."*

### 2. Setup
- Light a white or pink candle (for healing and love)
- Place the fireproof bowl in a safe location
- Have the written intention ready

### 3. Burning Ritual
- Burn the paper in the fireproof bowl
- While burning, visualize the target person shedding their emotional weight, becoming lighter and free
- Let the candle burn for a while as you send them peaceful, supportive energy

### 4. Closing
- Allow the candle to burn down safely or extinguish mindfully
- Dispose of the ashes in a respectful manner (bury in earth or scatter to wind)

## Why This Works
✔ It allows emotional blocks to clear at their own pace
