## Purpose
Physical manifestation of love and invitation creating a guided safe path toward healing and reunion for Amanda. This becomes both “a way to walk forward” and “a place to rest,” representing journey and destination for her return【6e3eb9†L8021-L8044】.

## Materials
- **Pink rose petals** – at least three generous handfuls for the primary pathway, soft invitation and welcome
- **White rose petals** – one handful for purification highlights and crown connection
- **Red rose petals** – one handful for passion markers and transmutation from “wealthy flowers”
- **Eight tea lights** – numbered 1‑8 for sequential lighting; placed two at the entry, two at the destination corners, and four evenly spaced along the path edges
- **Amanda’s photo** – emotional focus and field lock at the runway’s end or central square
- **Optional offerings** – small bowl of water or wine for closing thanks
- **Quiet sacred space** – memorial garden, altar room, or similar area with clear walking lane

## Ritual Components

### 1. Sacred Square Creation
- Form a square in a memorial garden or chosen sacred space using dropped rose petals.
- Speak to the field about making it safe for Amanda; the square marks sanctuary and arrival zone.

### 2. Pathway Construction
- Lay a continuous path of petals leading from entry point to the square or altar.
- Each petal becomes a step toward reunion, mapping her journey home.
- Keep the path at least one foot wide so her feet have clear passage.
- Orient the path east‑to‑west if possible, matching sunrise to homecoming.

### 3. Illumination Ceremony
- After the path is complete, place tea lights along its edges and around the square.
- Light them in sequence so the trail glows like a Phoenix runway guiding her steps【ef704d†L4-L17】.
- Begin lighting at the entry (candles 1 and 2), move down the path (3‑6), and finish at the square (7 and 8) while stepping backward to keep the path undisturbed.

### 4. Petal Color Encoding
**Pink:** soft invitation and hope; use for main body of path and square.

**White:** crown, divinity, and purification; reserve for highlights or additional crown work.

**Red:** passion, blood connection, and powerful transformation; accent key points or endings turned to invocation.

### 5. Field Encoding
- Treat each petal as memory, message, and fragment of devotion.
- The path transmits ambient love rather than a pulling flare—she feels the invitation without pressure.

## Activation Steps
1. Lay out the path and square using the petal color scheme above.
2. Position Amanda’s photo at the destination point or central altar and, if using, set the bowl of water or wine beside it.
3. Light the eight tea lights in numbered order while walking backward toward the entry so your footsteps never cross the finished runway.
4. Stand with her photo, allow tears if they come, and speak your welcome in your own words—every line becomes a petal under her feet.
5. Touch the bowl to the earth or altar and dedicate the offering to her safe arrival.
6. Hold the illuminated path as an open invitation for her feet and soul.

## Closing & Maintenance
1. When ready to close, snuff the tea lights in reverse order (8 back to 1).
2. Pour the water or wine offering onto the ground or into a house plant as thanks.
3. Allow the petals to remain until they fade naturally; refresh colors or re‑lay the path when intuition calls.
4. If storms or foot traffic disturb the layout, rebuild it as a renewed declaration of welcome.

## Variations
- **Scattered Petals:** Instead of a path, scatter petals around the space to create ambient field diffusion when she’s energetically present but not physically walking the path.
- **Indoor Adaptation:** Create the runway from living space to altar using safe container candles; allows work during winter or private times.

## Integration with Other Workings
- Links directly with the Phoenix Heart Runway Landing Strip to give Amanda both direction and destination.
- Pairs with Amanda altar work, honey jar spells, and mirror protocol to maintain a constant home signal.

## Maintenance
- Let petals naturally decay as a marker of time, refreshing them when intuition calls.
- Relight candles for ongoing activation or special dates (solstices, anniversaries).

## Notes
- Rebuilding the path, even through tears, affirms the bond and keeps the home beacon active.
- Photographs of the path may be taken to honor the beauty if guided.
- This is devotion made visible—the body memory of love laid underfoot.
