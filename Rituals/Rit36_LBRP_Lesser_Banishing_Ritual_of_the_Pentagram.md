## **Ritual Classification**
- **Type:** Foundational Purification & Space Clearing
- **Category:** Advanced Ceremonial Magic
- **Frequency:** Performed before major workings (especially Tribunal rituals)
- **Complexity Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

## **Purpose**
- **Primary:** Clear ritual space of unwanted influences

- **Optional Tools:** 
  - Purple candle (Crown Command Candle)
  - 5 elemental candles for pentagram points
  - Ritual blade or wand (for drawing pentagrams)
  - Incense (frankincense, sandalwood, or clove for field-clearing)

## **The Modernized LBRP Structure**

### **Step 1: The Kabbalistic Cross (Anchoring the Pillar)**
**Spoken Invocation:**
> "I AM source flame incarnate.  
> Light descends through my crown and fills this vessel.  
> I stand as pillar between heaven and earth.  
> My field is sovereign. My words are law.  
> By flame authority, I claim this space."

**Actions:**
- Touch forehead: "Ateh" (Thou art)
- Touch heart: "Malkuth" (The Kingdom)  
- Touch right shoulder: "Ve-Geburah" (And the Power)
- Touch left shoulder: "Ve-Gedulah" (And the Glory)
- Clasp hands at heart: "Le-Olam, Amen" (Forever, Amen)

### **Step 2: The Four Pentagrams (Banishing Earth Pattern)**
**Drawing Pattern:** 
1. Start at top point
2. Draw down to bottom-left
3. Up to far right
4. Across to far left  
5. Down to bottom-right
6. Back to top (completing the star)

**At Each Quarter:**
- **East:** Draw pentagram, point through center, speak: **"By the power of Raphael, Lord of Air - all distortion is banished from this space!"**
- **South:** Draw pentagram, point through center, speak: **"By the power of Michael, Lord of Fire - all false flame is extinguished!"**  
- **West:** Draw pentagram, point through center, speak: **"By the power of Gabriel, Lord of Water - all emotional chaos is cleansed!"**
- **North:** Draw pentagram, point through center, speak: **"By the power of Uriel, Lord of Earth - all unstable foundation is removed!"**

### **Step 3: The Angel Invocation**
**Spoken while extending arms:**
> "Before me, Raphael - bringing divine breath and clarity.  
> Behind me, Gabriel - guarding my soul path with truth.  
> On my right hand, Michael - wielding the sword of justice.  
> On my left hand, Uriel - grounding divine will in earthly form.  
> Above me shines the six-rayed star of divine balance.  
> Below me burns the flame of sovereign earth.  
> I am temple. I am flame. I am law."

### **Step 4: Closing the Kabbalistic Cross**
**Repeat the opening sequence:**
- Touch forehead: "Ateh"
- Touch heart: "Malkuth"  
- Touch right shoulder: "Ve-Geburah"
- Touch left shoulder: "Ve-Gedulah"
- Clasp hands: "Le-Olam, Amen"

## **Specific Applications in Justin's Practice**

### **Pre-Tribunal Preparation**
- **Essential before:** Tribunal of Two Flames
- **Purpose:** Establishes divine authority before invoking both light and shadow forces
- **Enhancement:** Combined with purple candle placement at North for "Crown Command"

### **Field Protection Protocol**
- **Used for:** Clearing Amanda's energetic field of interference
- **Combined with:** Florida Water and Dragon's Blood incense sealing
- **Timing:** Performed before major Amanda-focused workings

### **Angelic Witness Preparation**
- **Specific Use:** Preparing space for Michael (Enforcer) and Gabriel (Protector) invocations
- **Authority Level:** Establishes practitioner as sovereign operator, not supplicant
- **Field Effect:** Creates clean sacred space where invited beings cannot exceed assigned roles

## **Advanced Notes**

### **Modernization Elements**
- **Language:** Updated from classical Hebrew/Latin to direct flame authority declarations
- **Intention:** Emphasizes personal sovereignty rather than supplication
- **Integration:** Seamlessly connects with Goetic and archangelic workings

### **Field Mechanics**
- **Energy Pattern:** Creates protective barrier while maintaining openness to invited influences
- **Duration:** Effects persist through subsequent ritual work
- **Amplification:** Enhanced when performed with blood offering or 7.83 Hz frequency support

## **Safety & Sovereignty Notes**
- **Authority Level:** Practitioner operates as divine executor, not petitioner
- **Protection:** Establishes clear boundaries for all spiritual interactions
- **Control:** Maintains field sovereignty while allowing specific invited presences

## **Integration with Other Workings**
- **Prerequisite for:** All major tribunal and goetic operations
- **Combines with:** Tribunal of Two Flames, Amanda protection spells, field clearing rituals
- **Enhancement:** Can be followed by specific angel invocations for witness/protection roles
