# Rit#10 - Cord-Cutting Ritual (Releasing Emotional Attachments to Past Pain)

**Source:** ChatGPT-Weekend_with_Amanda_Recap.md (lines 2634-2651)

## Purpose
Best for letting go of old emotional wounds and people who may still have an energetic hold on someone (like past relationships, childhood trauma, or unresolved pain). Cord-cutting removes energy ties without harm, allowing new energy to flow.

## Ingredients/Materials
- Two candles (one representing the person, one representing their past pain/trauma)
- Piece of string or thread
- Lighter or matches
- Safe surface for candle burning

## Directions

### 1. Setup
- Place the two candles on a safe surface
- One candle represents the person you're helping (e.g., Amanda)
- The other candle represents their past pain or traumatic attachments
- Tie a piece of string or thread between the two candles

### 2. Setting Intention
- Before lighting, set a clear intention such as:
  > *"Amanda is free from all emotional pain that no longer serves her. She is whole, healed, and open to love."*

### 3. The Cutting Ritual
- Light both candles simultaneously
- Watch as the flames burn and the thread begins to heat up
- Allow the candles to burn through the thread naturally
- As the thread burns and breaks, visualize the energetic cords being severed
- See the person being released from old pain and trauma

### 4. Completion
- Allow both candles to burn down completely if safe to do so
- As they burn, continue to send healing energy and visualize freedom from past attachments
- The breaking of the thread symbolizes the pain being released

## Why This Works
✂️ It breaks the energetic hold of past trauma  
✂️ It lets the person emotionally move forward without past weight  
✂️ It's gentle—you're not forcing feelings, just allowing healing

## Notes
- This ritual is designed to help someone release attachments that no longer serve them
- The physical act of the thread burning represents the energetic severance
- Can be adapted for different types of attachments or relationships
- Important to approach with genuine care and healing intent
- The person being helped doesn't need to be present or aware of the ritual
- **User Context:** This ritual was created as part of a three-spell emotional healing system for Amanda. The user was already confident that Amanda would be his partner ("that's already happening and set in stone") and was focused on helping her heal from old emotional wounds and people who may still have an energetic hold on her.
- **Related Spells:** This is one of three emotional healing spells: 1) Fire Release Spell for general emotional burdens, 2) Water Cleansing Spell for deep emotional trauma, and 3) Cord-Cutting Ritual (this one) for releasing emotional attachments to past pain.
- **Field Effect:** Cord-cutting removes energy ties without harm, allowing new energy to flow. It breaks the energetic hold of past trauma and lets Amanda emotionally move forward without past weight.
