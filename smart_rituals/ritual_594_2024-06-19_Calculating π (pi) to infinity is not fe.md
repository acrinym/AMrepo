Calculating π (pi) to infinity is not feasible because π is an irrational number, meaning its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating. However, we can compute π to a very high precision using various algorithms and mathematical techniques.

One of the most efficient algorithms for calculating π to many decimal places is the **Chudnovsky algorithm**, which is based on Ramanujan's π formulas. It is used in many of the record-setting calculations of π.

Here's a brief overview of the Chudnovsky algorithm:

The Chudnovsky formula is:
\[ 
\frac{1}{\pi} = 12 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (545140134k + 13591409)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 (640320)^{3k+3/2}} 
\]

Using this algorithm, modern computers have calculated trillions of digits of π. Here are a few key points:
- π has been calculated to over 50 trillion digits as of 2022.
- These calculations require powerful computing resources and specialized software.

While it's not possible to compute π to infinity, here are the first few digits of π for reference:

If you need to calculate π to a high number of digits for a specific application, there are various libraries and software available:
- **MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library):** A library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding.
- **GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library):** A library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.

For practical purposes, here are links to some resources that offer more detailed information and tools for calculating π to many digits:

- [GMP Library](https://gmplib.org/)
- [PiWorld - Current Record of Pi Digits](https://piworld.calibourne.com/)
