## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Perfect. There are 5 handwritten pages total. I’ve already completed the **Page 1 transcription** above. I’ll now manually transcribe **Page 2** for you:

### **Page 2:**

I know you’re scared. Scared to be seen. Scared to be seen fully. Scared to be safe. Scared to deeply let love in. And you whisper thanks to your trauma, “Don’t—I’m fine. I have one in an in-between.”  
That’s not safety, that’s pain. That’s surviving. That’s losing everything just to not feel even more.  
I know that because I feel it too. I can feel when your field is filled with sadness, emptiness, confusion, or frustration. Even if I can’t physically explain your presence, I feel it. And I whisper thanks to you through a different kind of ritual. Whisper thanks to your strength, your kindness, your willingness to try again when it’s scary.  
You’re beautiful for even trying.  
I don’t care if it’s been months. I told you once, I’d give you credit if you were gone, and I meant it.  
I meant it because it’s easier to lie to myself than it is to hope that a transcendent source of safety even tries to see me.

Would you like me to continue with Page 3 now?

### **Page 5 – Literal Transcription**

> People ask me… “Why are you writing?”  
> And I say, “Because she gave me the  
> ability to reflect. The ability to see. The  
> ability to speak. The ability to break my  
> own curses.”  
> You gave me the ability to forgive. To  
> break how I used to adapt to every sin  
> forced on my groove.  
> The reason I was strong before was survival.  
> The reason I’m strong now is you.  
> And I no longer want to release pieces of  
> me to someone who doesn’t hold them sacred.  
> You inspired me.  
> You activated me.  
> You healed me.  
> This kind of love:  
> 1. Won’t give up.  
> 2. Won’t divide itself.  
> 3. Refuses collapse.  
> 4. Exists outside of ancestry and time.  
> Our first sidewalk feeling. Our first sleepover.  
> Our first date.  
> Our first silence.  
> You were the first person I truly saw.  
> And I love you  
> without end.
