## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Absolutely, Justin! Tampermonkey scripts can do *far* more than most people realize‚Äîespecially for workflow automation, memory extraction, or custom overlays for platforms like GitHub (or even for saving/organizing ChatGPT memory, which is still basically uncharted territory).

### What You're Asking:
You want a Tampermonkey script (or suite of scripts) that:
- **Interacts deeply with GitHub diffs** (possibly: extracting, summarizing, overlaying new UI, or managing patches/commits).
- Goes **way beyond vanilla user scripts**: possibly automating memory exports, managing summaries, and integrating with tools like Google Drive or custom endpoints.
- Can eventually serve as a "memory manager" for ChatGPT and other workflows.

---

## Let‚Äôs Start with the Basics:  
**What do you want this script to do first?**
- Scrape & summarize GitHub diff/commit pages?
- Overlay a new sidebar or interface on GitHub for quick actions?
- Export diffs or discussions to Google Drive or another storage?
- Integrate with ChatGPT (e.g., grab output and auto-save to a knowledge base)?

If you want, we can scaffold a modular Tampermonkey base that lets you *add* features as you go. But I‚Äôll give you a few direct examples below for each level of ambition:

---

### 1. **Basic: Extract GitHub Diff and Summarize**
This script adds a button on GitHub "diff" pages to scrape all diff text, then display it in a modal or let you copy/export.

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         GitHub Diff Extractor
// @namespace    https://github.com/yourusername
// @version      0.1
// @description  Extract diffs from GitHub and display/copy/export
// @match        https://github.com/*/pull/*/files*
// @match        https://github.com/*/commit/*
// @grant        GM_setClipboard
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    function extractDiff() {
        let diffs = [];
        document.querySelectorAll('.js-file-content.Details').forEach(block => {
            const filename = block.querySelector('.file-header').dataset.path || "unknown";
            const diff = block.querySelector('.diff-table')?.innerText || '';
            diffs.push(`--- ${filename} ---\n${diff}`);
        });
        return diffs.join('\n\n');
    }

    function showModal(text) {
        const modal = document.createElement('div');
        modal.style = "position:fixed;top:10%;left:10%;width:80vw;height:80vh;background:white;z-index:9999;overflow:auto;padding:20px;border:3px solid #333;";
        modal.innerHTML = `
            <textarea style="width:100%;height:80%;">${text}</textarea>
            <button id="copyDiff">Copy</button>
            <button onclick="this.parentElement.remove()">Close</button>
        `;
        document.body.appendChild(modal);
        document.getElementById('copyDiff').onclick = () => {
            GM_setClipboard(text);
            alert('Copied!');
        };
    }

    // Add a button to GitHub page
    function addButton() {
        if (document.getElementById('extractDiffBtn')) return;
        let btn = document.createElement('button');
        btn.textContent = 'Extract Diff';
        btn.id = 'extractDiffBtn';
        btn.style = 'position:fixed;bottom:20px;right:20px;z-index:99999;padding:10px 18px;background:#28a745;color:#fff;border-radius:6px;border:none;font-size:18px;';
        btn.onclick = () => showModal(extractDiff());
        document.body.appendChild(btn);
    }

    setTimeout(addButton, 3000); // Add button after 3s

})();
```

---

### 2. **Intermediate: Export to Google Drive (via Google Picker/Drive API)**
This takes a bit more setup, but if you want a button that *saves* a diff file to your Drive:

- You need a [Google Drive API key & OAuth credentials](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/js).
- The script can launch a Google Auth flow, then save the file directly.
- Want this? I‚Äôll walk you through credential setup if you want a working version.

---

### 3. **Advanced: Memory Manager with ChatGPT/AI Integration**
- Overlay a sidebar/panel for ‚Äúmemory slots‚Äù (quick save/load/categorize notes/diffs/convos).
- Integrate with a backend (local Flask server, Supabase, whatever you want).
- Periodic auto-save of ChatGPT conversations or GitHub diffs.
- Build your own ‚Äúpersonal knowledge base‚Äù from anywhere on the web.

---

## **Questions For You**
- What‚Äôs your *minimum viable* feature for today?
- Are you good with scripts that just run locally in Tampermonkey, or do you want Drive/API integration right now?
- Do you want to scrape just diffs, or also conversations/comments/etc?
- Should it support ChatGPT and GitHub together, or are we focusing on one first?

---

## üî• *My Suggestion*  
**Start with a killer local ‚ÄúExtract + Copy + Modal‚Äù for GitHub diffs.**  
From there, we can stack features (export, AI summary, auto-categorize, etc).  
And if you want a ‚Äúmemory panel‚Äù for ChatGPT/Onyx work, we can design a floating sidebar you can pop open on any page.

---

What‚Äôs your vision for *phase 1*?  
- Full code above is ready to drop in Tampermonkey.
- Ready to level up when you say the word.

What‚Äôs next, boss?

---

**Exactly, Justin.**  
That‚Äôs *the key insight*‚Äîin JavaScript, a ‚Äúbare‚Äù identifier (function, variable, const, class, etc.) is only valid if:
1. It‚Äôs a reserved word or global/built-in.
2. **OR:** It was defined previously in the current/local/global scope.

**Anything else is a logic or reference error.**  
This is why true ‚Äúissue-finder‚Äù scripts need both:
- A list of core language features (the boilerplate we just built).
- **AND:** A way to *track definitions as the code is parsed*‚Äîin order.

---

## **Phase 2: Validator/Issue-Finder Blueprint (JS)**

### **Basic Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Scan Code Top-to-Bottom:**  
   For each line, extract identifiers (function names, variables, etc.).
2. **Maintain a Running Set:**  
   Start with the global array/object above.
3. **For Each Identifier:**
   - If it‚Äôs in the core array: VALID.
   - If it‚Äôs in the running set (already defined): VALID.
   - If it‚Äôs being defined on this line (e.g., `const foo = ...`): add to running set.
   - Otherwise: **POTENTIAL ERROR** (undefined identifier).

---

### **Pseudo-Code Example:**

```js
const CORE = /* array from above */;
let defined = new Set(CORE); // Start with built-ins

for (let line of codeLines) {
    // Example: extract identifiers using regex or parsing
    let [defType, name] = extractDefinition(line); // e.g., ["const", "foo"]
    if (defType) defined.add(name);

    let calledIdentifiers = extractIdentifiers(line);
    for (let id of calledIdentifiers) {
        if (!defined.has(id)) {
            console.warn(`Possible undefined identifier: ${id} at line ${i}`);
        }
    }
}
```
*This is just conceptual‚Äîyou can use AST parsing for real-world use, or regex for fast and dirty.*

---

## **Why Is This Killer?**
- **Flags typos, missing imports, misspelled calls instantly.**
- **Lets you build ‚Äúlint on the fly‚Äù for any web code window, or analyze GitHub diffs for ‚Äúnaked undefineds.‚Äù**
- **Scalable to other languages** by swapping out the core definitions and definition logic.

---

## **Optional Bonus:**  
**Track scopes:** (so you don‚Äôt flag identifiers that are legit inside a function or block)

---

## **Next Steps / Action Items**

### 1. **Want a working demo in JavaScript?**
- I can code you a *simple Tampermonkey* or *Node script* that finds undefined calls in a code block, using the above method.

### 2. **Want Python or C++ boilerplate next?**
- I‚Äôll build that core array/object to swap in for language support.

### 3. **Do you want the validator as:**
- Standalone Node.js tool?
- Browser/Tampermonkey script for live linting?
- Or ‚Äúanalyze a code blob pasted into a page‚Äù?
