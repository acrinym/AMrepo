## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Absolutely. Here’s your **Suno-ready song structure**—fully stylized, no extra labels except *Bridge*, *Chorus*, *Final Chorus*, etc., and embedded style guidance for instrumentation, mood, and delivery.

---

🎵 **He Was Never Really There**  
*(Genre: cinematic rock / dark ambient with glitchy textures, minor key, haunting female vocal backups on chorus, deep male lead vocal – think “Imagine Dragons meets Zayde Wølf with a Nine Inch Nails edge”)*

*(Intro – atmospheric, cold synth pads + echoing guitar delay)*  
We met in truth, but you wore a lie  
Wrapped in robes of wisdom, while watching her cry  
Preaching peace with your hands in the dirt  
But silence is louder when it’s used to hurt  

*(Drop into slow beat with distorted bass throb)*  
You said she was free, then called her back  
Played the sickness card to hide your lack  
While she cooked your meals and watched you sleep  
I held her soul while you made her weep  

*(Bridge – rising tension, drums building, strings weaving in)*  
Every night you coughed, she came  
You wore your weakness like a flame  
But it burned her out, not lit her up  
You drank her care from a poisoned cup  

*(Chorus – full power, cinematic impact with heavy drums, big reverb, harmony backing)*  
You were never really there  
Just a shadow in her lair  
Built a throne from guilt and need  
While I sowed love that set her free  

You said you’d step aside  
Then pulled her back to hide  
But I stood firm, laid truth bare—  
And you were never really there  

*(Verse – quieter, echo vocals, broken piano melody)*  
Valentine’s canceled by your cough and moan  
But she’s still alone, still on the phone  
She could’ve flown, we could’ve seen  
But you locked the gate with fake routine  

(soft snare brush + pulsing synth beneath)  
You fed her comfort soaked in dust  
I offered healing, built on trust  
And every time she reached for air  
You closed the windows, masked as care  

*(Bridge – rhythmic glitch loops, haunting female background vocal harmonies)*  
You weren't love—you were delay  
You played the part to make her stay  
But women don't forget the feel  
Of hands that hold versus hands that steal  

*(Chorus – repeat with added harmonies, strings swelling behind)*  
You were never really there  
Just a mirror that wouldn't stare  
Built your world on false repair  
While I burned bright in open air  

You said “let go” and then you pulled  
Your silence screams, your sickness lulled  
But now the field is clear and bare—  
And you were never really there  

*(Final Chorus – breakdown, kick pulse only at first, then full instrumental swell)*  
You were never really there  
Not in spirit, not in care  
Just a spell that wore her thin  
A loop she’s finally breaking in  

You don’t get to play the guide  
When you only ever hide  
I stood in fire. You breathed her air.  
But you…  
You were never really there.

*(Outro – slow guitar fade, ambient noise decay, last vocal line whispered)*  
Never… really… there…

Let me know if you want this formatted for direct Suno input, with character limits per line/section, or if you’d like a female version, duet, or remix variant.

---

Got it. Here's the **Suno-ready version** with concise structure labels and only valid, compatible styling cues that Suno will understand—no artist names, just musical descriptors it recognizes.

---

🎵 **He Was Never Really There**  
*(Style: cinematic rock, minor key, full power chorus, heavy drums, ambient textures, big reverb, vocal harmony backing)*

---

*(Intro – ambient pads + echo guitar)*  
Met in truth, but you wore a lie  
Robes of wisdom, watching her cry  
Preached peace with silence sharp  
Disguised your harm as holy art  

*(Drop – slow beat + bass pulse)*  
She made your tea, you took her light  
Came when sick, stayed out of sight  
I held her heart while you played weak  
You fed off care she couldn't keep  

*(Bridge – rising drums, strings layered in)*  
Cough and call, she’d come again  
Used your pain to stake your claim  
But love ain't need, and truth ain't fear  
You're not her anchor—just what's near  

*(Chorus – full power, heavy drums, reverb, harmony backing)*  
You were never really there  
Just a shadow in her prayer  
Built your comfort out of chains  
While I stood out in the rain  

Said you’d stop, then reeled her in  
Played her warmth like it’s a win  
Now the field is clean and bare—  
You were never really there  

*(Verse – quiet + ambient texture)*  
Valentine’s fell to your fake cough  
She stayed back, the trip called off  
Could’ve seen her, held her tight  
But you needed to dim the light  

*(Bridge – glitch loop + slow build)*  
Called it help but drained her soul  
You kept her close to feel whole  
But women know when love’s not true—  
She’s waking up… and walking through  

*(Chorus – repeat with layered harmonies)*  
You were never really there  
Just a mask and hollow stare  
Said “move on,” then pulled her back  
Rope of guilt around the track  

She’s not your nurse, not your flame  
She’s not the prize in your sick game  
I was real, I showed up fair—  
You were never really there  

*(Final Chorus – breakdown then swell, cinematic build)*  
You were never really there  
Just a ghost who wouldn’t care  
Now the spell begins to break  
You’ll feel it all—the love you fake  

I’m the one who stayed and burned  
You’re the one who never learned  
The truth was clear, laid bare—  
You were never really there.  

*(Outro – ambient fade, soft vocal echo)*  
Never… really… there…
