## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

You’re 100% on the right track, Justin—**replaying** DOM manipulation logs (or macro logs) is exactly how you can "clone" web UI behaviors like in Hermes, but for *any* site, even when you don’t have direct access to their source code or event model.

### Hermes *already* has a working event recorder & macro replay engine

Based on the code in your uploaded Hermes script, **Hermes records DOM events (click, input, change, keydown, etc) as a list of objects:**  
```js
const eventDetails = {
    type: e.type,
    selector: selector,
    value: e.target.value,
    checked: e.target.checked,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    // ...etc
}
recordedEvents.push(eventDetails);
```
…and then it can **replay them** by dispatching events against those selectors, with real delays and input state.  
This is already the core mechanic you want.

## 🧩 What You Need for a “Universal DOM Replayer”

### 1. **Capture**
- Record all DOM events (as you already do).
- **Log precise selectors** (`getRobustSelector`) and, if possible, *contextual data* like parent window/frame.
- Store timestamps for accurate step timing.

### 2. **Replay**
- For each log entry, `querySelector` the saved element.
- Dispatch a synthetic event of the same type, *with the saved properties* (key, value, mouse position, etc).
- Apply values directly for `input`/`change`.
- Delay between steps matches original (or allow “fast mode”).
- Optionally, **window/frame context**: If replaying in a multi-frame or popup context, be sure to select into the right document/window.

### 3. **Network/Mutation Augmentation (Optional)**
- If you *also* capture XHR/fetch and mutation logs, you can combine those into “action context” for debugging, but most “UI automation” is satisfied by event log replay.

## ✨ *What Hermes Already Does That You Can Build On:*

- **Macro recording/replay** (`recordEvent`, `playMacro`) does exactly this.  
- **Event types, selector paths, values, mouse/keyboard data**—all are saved per event.
- **Selector matching and dispatching** is robust (it tries to apply value, checked, and dispatches input/change/blur after).
- **Supports delays and order.**

---

## 🚀 **How to “Generalize” This for Any Site:**

1. **Extract the macro/event recording and replay engine** from Hermes into a standalone userscript, or adapt it to your “super-watcher” script (above).
2. **Add an import/export option for logs**: So you can save a session (e.g., in JSON), and later “replay” on any matching site/context.
3. **Allow “step mode”**: Step through the replay, or run all at once.
4. **Support for additional event types** (drag, scroll, etc) if needed.

## 🧠 **Replay Strategy Pseudocode**

```js
// Assume log = [ {type, selector, value, ...}, ...]
async function replayDomEvents(log) {
  for (let i=0; i<log.length; ++i) {
    const ev = log[i];
    const el = document.querySelector(ev.selector);
    if (!el) continue;
    if (['input','change'].includes(ev.type) && ev.value !== undefined) el.value = ev.value;
    // ...set checked etc
    const evt = new Event(ev.type, { bubbles:true, cancelable:true });
    el.dispatchEvent(evt);
    // Delay to match timing (or fast mode)
    if (i > 0) await sleep(log[i].timestamp - log[i-1].timestamp);
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ **Practical Next Steps:**

- **Extend your watcher script** with a “Replay Log” button:
  - Allow user to load a saved log (`input type="file"`).
  - Parse log, replay as above.
- **Or, use Hermes itself as a base**—just adapt it for your “all events, all sites” use case.
- Optionally: Record more window/frame context, for sites that use popups or iframes.

## **What’s *Different* vs Hermes?**

- Hermes is already *damn close*—its UI is just optimized for forms and macro lists.
- What you want is: **Record everything, save the log, and let you “replay” the workflow as a script**—which is only a tiny extension of what Hermes does.

### ⚡ **Want code to add a “Replay from JSON” to the watcher?**

If you want, I can:
- Provide a drop-in function for your watcher’s toolbar: “Upload and Replay Log”
- Or, make a *universal macro loader* that works with Hermes logs and others

**Just say the word.**  
You’ve *almost* got a universal Hermes with your code already. Want the import/replay code as a Tampermonkey drop-in?
