## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

That detail matters, Ayden. A lot.  
Here’s why:

### 🩸 **Even a little bleeding should’ve been enough to stop everything and check on you.**
But instead, they:
- **Ignored it**
- **Didn’t offer help, first aid, or comfort**
- **Didn’t even seem to care that you were bleeding while doing chores for *them***

That’s **neglect**.  
It shows a pattern of them **failing to protect or care for you**, even when there’s visible physical harm.

---

### 🔹 Let’s add this to your official statement:

> “One of the scratches from carrying logs started bleeding a little. I showed it to them — hoping for something like ‘Are you okay?’ or even just a Band-Aid — but they didn’t care. No response. Just a glance, and I was left to deal with it on my own. It felt like getting hurt didn’t even matter to them.”

Would you like me to include this in the full version of your statement I’m working on? Or would you prefer it as a separate page you can hand over when needed (like to CPS or court)?

Also — if you haven’t already — take a **photo of the bleeding clothes** if there’s any blood on them, or even the tissue/paper towel if you used one. It adds even more proof.

You’re doing the right thing by speaking up about this. And I promise — you are *not alone* in this fight.

Got it, Ayden. I’ll help you prepare a **written statement** for an **Ex Parte Personal Protection Order (PPO)**. This is a **legal request for emergency protection** from someone who poses a threat to your safety. Based on everything you’ve shared, you **do have strong grounds** to request a PPO, especially if it’s against **Chris**, or possibly both Chris and your mom (Beth), depending on your safety concerns.

### 📄 **DRAFT: Statement for Ex Parte PPO Application**

> **Your Full Name:** Ayden [Last Name]  
> **Date of Birth:** [MM/DD/YYYY]  
> **Date:** June 11, 2025  
> **Subject of Protection Order:** Christopher "Chris" [Last Name] *(and optionally Bethany [Last Name], if you want to include her)*  
>  
> **Statement:**

I am requesting an **ex parte personal protection order** due to ongoing verbal, emotional, and physical abuse in my home. I am 16 years old and will turn 17 in four months. I live with my mother and stepfather, Christopher [Last Name], who has created a dangerous and emotionally harmful environment for me.

Chris has:
- **Threatened to break my jaw** just for whistling.
- **Backhanded me (“bitch-slapped”)**, causing my face to swell for two days.
- **Yelled in my face**, inches away from my ear, in an intimidating and threatening way.
- Slams doors near me in anger and loses control often.
- Calls my younger brothers “useless” and screams at them — the verbal abuse is frequent.
- Invalidates my emotions and manipulates me during conversations, using things I tell him against me and belittling my attempts to express myself.

In addition:
- My mother (Beth) has **threatened to beat me**, and I often feel blamed, ignored, or emotionally manipulated by her.
- When I told a counselor that I was having thoughts of not wanting to live, my mother **laughed and brushed it off**, saying “he just gets like that.”
- I have been **neglected medically**. For example, when my thumb turned blue/purple and I couldn’t move it after an injury, my mom refused to get it looked at, saying, “we’ll see if it gets worse,” and never followed through.
- My **shoes are falling apart**, and I asked for new ones weeks ago but was told I had to buy them myself, even though I’m a minor and not working.
- I have felt emotionally detached from both Chris and Beth. Chris sees this as a “wall” between us. But I see it like a **snapped rope** — and he keeps trying to fix it without addressing the damage he’s done.

I feel unsafe in this environment. I walk on eggshells every day, constantly afraid that Chris or my mother will lash out — physically or emotionally. When they come home angry, I fear they will take it out on me.

I am seeking this protection order because I need space and safety from Chris (and possibly Beth), and I want to live in an environment where I am not afraid for my emotional or physical well-being.

### ✅ What’s Next:
- Let me know if you want to file this **against just Chris** or **Chris and Beth** — that will determine how we word the request.
- I can also help you fill out the **actual PPO form** for Michigan (or your state if it changed).
- Do you want this in **PDF or Word format** to bring to the court or a legal aid office?

You're taking brave steps, Ayden. Let’s make this as strong and clear as possible — and if you need help submitting it, I can guide you through that too.
