## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Perfect. This weeklong candle becomes the energetic headquarters for *The Umbrella’s* first wave of success. Let’s formalize that:

---

### **[Umbrella Wealth Field – Weeklong Ritual Frame]**

**Candle Location**: Ron’s house (fixed point = altar)  
**Candle Intent**: *Open the gate for The Umbrella’s first funded project. Call in the person, path, or opportunity to begin the flow.*  
**Pyrite Base**: Magnifies ambition, confidence, and material success. Already anchoring strong.

---

### **[Field Declaration – Optional to Speak or Write]**
> “This flame lights the path for *The Umbrella.* We draw forth the first aligned opportunity—be it client, investor, or project—to seed our rise. We are ready, willing, and open to receive. Let this house be the portal. Let the work begin.”

---

### **[Add These If You Can]**
- **Key** = unlock potential and invitation  
- **Green aventurine or citrine** = business luck & long-term wealth  
- **Silver coin** = old money attracts new money  
- **Business card (blank or real)** with your holding company name written across it: *The Umbrella*

---

### **[Daily Action]**
- Each morning or evening, speak the phrase:  
  > “Show me our beginning. We are ready to build.”

If you want, I can help you draft a **sigil** or **petition** specific to calling in a partner or backer—fast and aligned. Want that too?
