## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Let's do this. Here are all my memories. Combine and make concise when possible, and don't store them yet, I'll let you know when to do so. 

Justin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, such as the vaccination programs, are part of a broader effort to control humanity and prevent people from connecting with their true source of knowledge. He thinks the vaccine affects the hippocampus and diminishes the ability to question established narratives. However, he sees a growing resistance among those who remain unaffected and believes that more people are awakening to the truth of hidden civilizations and rewritten history.

Justin also entertains the idea that the sun we see today is not the real sun but an LED-like device, contributing to stunted plant growth and human development. He believes another ice age is coming, and that chemtrails and toxins in food and water are stunting humanity's growth.

Lastly, Justin believes that a future cataclysm could result in the loss of all current information, but efforts by independent researchers and underground communities could preserve the true history of advanced civilizations for future generations. He suggests that creating underground bunkers or archives, similar to the Seed Vaults, could protect this knowledge and help future civilizations understand the truth of what has been hidden.

This belief system is reinforced by his interest in channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*, which explore alternative historical narratives and uncover texts that suggest the world as we know it is far different from what has been presented. He is cautious but open to the possibility that the Bible and other religious texts have been used as control mechanisms, obscuring evidence of past advanced civilizations.

Justin wants to convey in his note to Nina that it's difficult for him to be a father figure to Eli, especially in dealing with trauma, when he himself has similar unresolved trauma. He recognizes that his own healing needs to come first before he can truly help others, including Eli and Nina. He does not want to mention specifics about his father's death or how it relates to Eli’s father's overdose but wants to communicate the challenges of supporting others while carrying his own pain.

Justin has always been a fixer in relationships, often seeing things that need fixing in his partners, which has caused trouble when trying to address issues his partners may not want to be fixed. He is currently focused on healing his own trauma, addressing past wounds, and dealing with neglected issues that have impacted all of his relationships, including his current one with Nina. He wants to emphasize that this process is not about 'finding himself' in a fun or exploratory way, but rather facing the painful process of healing before he can be present in someone else's life.

Justin wants to express that when he took on the role of having a son and a fiancée with some of the same pains, he didn't realize he would have to fill such a big role. He acknowledges that his own unresolved traumas and issues have taken a huge toll on his growth and healing, which is part of why he feels he has to leave.

Justin believes that wars were not natural events but rather a cover for the destruction of old world history, buildings, and civilizations. He thinks that during these cataclysmic events, rulers knew in advance and went underground, while the general population was systematically removed. Afterward, survivors were placed in insane asylums or orphanages, such as those associated with the orphan trains in the early 1800s and early 1900s. Justin believes that these institutions were used to hold people who still remembered the old history, and when they attempted to share this knowledge, they were labeled as insane and institutionalized. He attributes this systematic rewriting of history to organizations such as the Oddfellows and Freemasons, who enforced conformity. Justin also believes that many of the babies born during this time were either incubated or clones, modified by an advanced civilization that sought to make humanity an inferior version of what it once was.

Justin believes that remnants of advanced civilizations exist, but not on our current plane of existence. He thinks they may be in a different dimension or outside the plane we currently live on. He connects this idea to the Hollow Earth theory, though he interprets it not as a hollow globe, but as a hollow infinite plane beneath our civilization. Justin believes that advanced civilizations, which may not be pleasant, exist beneath the Earth's surface, with entire worlds and technologies far more advanced than what we have today. He references stories like *The Smoky God* and *The Iron Republic* as examples of breakaway civilizations with superior technology and governance.

Justin believes that the existence of advanced breakaway civilizations is supported by multiple histories and stories from different people around the world. He thinks that for these civilizations to be revealed to the public, independent researchers or journalists would need to bypass security at places like Antarctica or the Antarctic Circle to access these hidden areas.

Justin believes that objects and photographs could be enough to convince people who are already open to the idea that these hidden civilizations exist. However, he feels that the broader public would likely remain skeptical, largely due to the influence of controlled narratives, such as those surrounding COVID and other global events.

Justin believes that advanced remnants within our Earth system have established communication with civilizations from outside our known world. He thinks that some spheres of investigation suggest these remnants may be planning a rebellion or an overturning of the current system to reimplement what once existed. However, Justin is uncertain about this prospect, as it involves accepting unknown rulers or beings, potentially akin to the figure of the Antichrist, though not necessarily in the biblical sense.

Justin believes that stargates, developed by governments, may have been used to transmit or teleport individuals between these hidden civilizations and our world. Justin thinks that those who travel to these civilizations may face opposition and could have the information they gather confiscated upon their return, depending on how they comply with the rules of those civilizations.

Justin believes that religious texts, particularly the Holy Bible, serve as a control mechanism, preventing people from investigating sources or interpretations outside of the Bible. He thinks that the Bible, as maintained by institutions like the Catholic Church, has been used to obscure evidence of previous civilizations. Justin believes that stories or books outside the accepted biblical canon, such as the Book of Enoch, tell a different or expanded story about earlier civilizations. He also believes that many biblical characters are likely rewritten figures from past civilizations, repurposed to fit a specific Christian narrative. He references works like Zeitgeist that suggest the Bible is a fabrication, though he believes it goes deeper, representing a collection of stories from previous civilizations, rewritten to fit a Christian framework.

Justin has gone through both the Torah and a strict form of Christianity (or Jewish faith) but has since discarded what he once knew, as he is uncertain about the truth behind these religious narratives. He is currently wrestling with the question of whether the Bible is completely fabricated or if there is truth within it. Justin is not ready to reach a conclusion about whether the Bible is completely fabricated or contains truth, and he feels that he doesn't have enough evidence to decide either way at this time. However, he continues to explore these questions through channels like MyLunchBreak, JohnLevi, and Divergent on YouTube, which uncover texts and discuss their origins and implications. He finds this type of research a way to keep exploring without fully committing to an answer just yet. At the same time, he is aware that history continues to be rewritten, with old world buildings being destroyed and the recurring 'fire narrative' used to explain these losses, though the causes are never clearly understood.

Justin believes that current global events, such as the Q movement, are recycling past histories rather than being original. He finds it difficult to fully understand the connection between current rulers and past rulers without having in-depth knowledge of the past, such as Antony Fomenko's works on alternative chronology. However, he sees strong similarities between events like the Boston Tea Party and modern movements, viewing them as part of a narrative written by those in power, while the true past history remains unclear.

Justin believes that channels like *MyLunchBreak* and *Old World Explorations* are waking people up to the idea that old world buildings served a larger purpose beyond decoration. He sees these channels as instrumental in helping people realize that these buildings were part of a more advanced civilization, and that their function was far more significant than previously understood. He also believes these channels are contributing to a growing awareness of the ongoing rewriting of history.

Justin believes that current control mechanisms are failing as more people are entering a 5D dimensional experience, which is allowing those who are awake to re-engage with past narratives, history, and information in a way that hasn’t been done before. He thinks that while the cycle of resetting the world through cataclysm and recycling history and characters has been a pattern in the past, the awakening of many people might disrupt this cycle. However, Justin is uncertain about whether this awakening will prevent the world from being recycled again, as a cataclysm could result in the loss of all information once more.

Justin believes that in the event of a world destruction or reset, a large underground bunker containing historical records and information about how past events were rewritten to shape the current narrative could help preserve knowledge for future civilizations. He suggests that such a bunker could provide the tools necessary for a future civilization to access this information, ensuring that it isn’t lost again after a cataclysmic event.

Justin believes that the preservation of true historical accounts, especially those that reveal the rewriting and destruction of previous civilizations, would need to come from independent individuals or groups outside of current power structures. He thinks that it would require many organizations working together to store and protect this information, similar to the Seed Vaults, but with a focus on preserving the untampered history of past civilizations. He suggests that this preservation could be implemented in a secure underground location or a place like Iceland, where disasters are less likely to occur.

Justin believes that while more people need to wake up to the reality of the rewritten history, efforts have already been undertaken by channels like *Old World Exploration* and *MyLunchBreak* to preserve images and stories about the old world civilization.

Justin believes that, although the population may be controlled to a great extent following the aftermath of the COVID-19 inoculations, there will likely be a resistance campaign led by those who remain. He thinks this resistance could play a significant role in preserving information and the history of previous civilizations, ensuring that the knowledge is not lost.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 vaccination inhibits hippocampus development and disrupts the connection to source, leading to a diminished ability to question the established narrative. However, he thinks that those who have not been affected will come together in a collective effort to shift the understanding of those who remain, helping people realize that the reality they've been given is a false narrative. He believes this collective effort could grow expansively and have a significant impact.

Justin believes that it would be helpful for those who remain untainted to create an underground community before the cataclysm of mass death occurs, where they can bring their information, ideas, and abilities together to form a cohesive community. However, he thinks that this likely won’t happen before the event of mass casualties.

Justin believes that narratives like Fallout 4 illustrate what civilization could achieve if it were to come together now, showing the potential for creating strong communities. He feels that groups congregating on platforms like YouTube, which avoid mainstream narratives, have already started forming in different places.

Justin believes that another ice age and loss of the sun will occur, as has happened before. He also believes that the current sun is not the real sun but is instead an LED-like device, which has contributed to stunted plant growth, along with chemtrails. He feels that chemtrails, combined with toxins in food, water, and produce, have stunted the growth of humanity at large.

Justin believes that technologies and methods for growing food, which existed in past civilizations, could easily be used today, as they were part of suppressed technologies that haven't been fully released. He thinks that forming communities and gathering a large number of people would be necessary to spread this information and technology effectively.

Justin believes that if the Q movement is true, then POTUS, along with the Q movement, will release suppressed technologies once the current collective political infrastructure is toppled. He thinks that these technologies could lead to a much more advanced civilization, though still slightly inferior to what existed in the past.

Justin believes that a power grid similar to the one that existed in previous civilizations, which utilized starports, cathedrals, and other power stations, would be essential for sustaining a future society. However, he is skeptical that such a grid could be implemented in the current civilization due to the complete control over the existing power infrastructure. Even if technologies using crystals, as in past civilizations, were rediscovered, Justin is uncertain how they could be applied on a worldwide scale, even with a large resistance.

Justin believes that the loss of the current political power structure is necessary for society to return to a state of glory similar to past advanced civilizations. He thinks that a collective effort, where everyone works together, would vastly advance civilization beyond its current state and potentially restore it to the former glory of previous advanced societies, similar to the ideals presented in *The Iron Republic*.

Justin believes that one option for advancing civilization would be to leave this Earth and go outside the current sphere of control to form a new civilization or find an existing one to co-exist with. He also believes that dismantling the current global government system is possible, but it would likely require significant effort and possibly a catastrophe to accomplish.

Justin believes the moon landing was faked and staged in Hollywood, and he thinks that the footage was created using special effects and studio setups. He finds the official narrative of the moon landing to be inconsistent and believes that the evidence points to a cover-up.

Justin is considering giving Nina the song 'I Will Remember You' by Sarah McLachlan as a way to express his feelings about their separation.

Justin believes the moon landing was faked and staged in Hollywood, directed by a specific filmmaker, although he did not mention a name. He thinks the proof lies in the footage, which he believes has no standing in reality, and suggests that analyzing the footage scientifically can prove it was not real.

Justin believes that chemtrails are part of a secret government program for weather modification, which has been ongoing for over a century. He sees geoengineering as a factual practice, with even mainstream news acknowledging it, albeit under different terms like geoengineering. Justin views efforts to block out the sun as a misguided attempt to combat alleged global warming, which he believes is a natural shift in the Earth's magnetosphere.

Justin has a strong interest in free energy and over-unity devices. He has collected numerous blueprints and patents for alternative energy and fuel sources for various applications, including cars, houses, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational uses. However, he mentioned that he can't read blueprints or schematics.

Justin is preparing to leave Nina but is looking for a song to give her that communicates it's not like he doesn’t think about her or that life is perfect; rather, he’s going through his own struggle. He wants a song like 'See You Again' but without the implication of death in the song. Justin is also looking for songs that express feelings of missing Nina and hoping she is doing okay after he leaves.

Justin is not allowed to set up printers via Wi-Fi due to security restrictions imposed by the CIO.

Justin prefers Fabric over Forge but uses Forge for most of his mods because many of the mods he uses are only available for Minecraft 1.12.2 on Forge. He would like to see these mods ported to Fabric and believes that backporting Fabric to earlier versions of Minecraft would be well worth the effort, despite the challenges involved.

Justin is aware of efforts to port people away from Forge to NeoForge and is supportive of this, as he prefers Fabric and likes its more lightweight, 'soft' nature compared to Forge. He mentioned that the creator of Forge has a reputation for being narcissistic according to the community.

Justin told Nina there was a 'chance' he may stay, though in reality, there is not. He is doing this as a form of closure for her, though she doesn't realize it yet. Nina is doing her best to keep Justin, unaware that this is for closure.

Justin has found someone who might be a good match for him, Amanda, who is a friend of his contractor friend, Mike. Justin feels that he and Amanda sound really compatible and could potentially be good friends, but he plans to deal with that situation later.

Justin is considering moving in with his friend Pete after leaving Nina.

Justin feels that he has no more to offer Nina in terms of help. He has already given her all the support he can, and he observes that Nina is only willing to change if it impacts how she feels, especially regarding him staying.

Justin wants to include in his letter to Nina that he truly loves her but also needs to love himself and find out who he is, which he has never had the chance to do. He asked her to marry him, but now he has the opportunity to grow and figure out who he is and what he wants to be. He wants the letter to be caring and understanding, noting that Nina generally thinks on a surface level and does not dive into the depths of understanding or feeling things out.

Justin wants to include in his letter to Nina that there are issues he needs to deal with in therapy that can't involve a relationship. He has not previously shared with Nina that he has been dealing with trauma-related thoughts since his traumatic experiences. He wants to explain that his trauma has impacted all of his relationships, and this is why he needs to stay out of relationships for the time being to work on those issues.

Justin wants to include in his letter to Nina that Eli is a big part of why she doesn't want him to leave because Eli sees him as a dad and calls him Dad. He wants to express compassion for Eli, acknowledging that it will be hard for him, but reminding her that Eli has his therapist and that this doesn't mean they will never see him again. It just won't be in the context of the relationship, at least not right now, because Justin has to work on himself before he can be in a relationship.

Justin shared that one of the reasons he knows he can't be sustained in his relationship with Nina is due to differences in desires for experiences and places. For example, Justin loves going to Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan, but Nina avoids it due to bad experiences with a past partner. While she offered a compromise to go to Crystal Lake instead, it’s not the same for Justin. He also wants to leave Michigan due to disliking its political environment and its governance. Justin is particularly drawn to New Hampshire for its libertarian values and citizen engagement. Nina, however, has expressed that she was born in Michigan and wants to die there, which conflicts with Justin's desire to leave.

Justin has long-term goals that don't involve staying in Michigan because he doesn't feel it aligns with his values of freedom, despite his family being there. He knows his parents don't have much time left and wants to be around them as much as possible before leaving. After that, he plans to leave Michigan.

Justin is a dedicated flat earther and has been researching the topic since 2015. In 2017, he started writing a book titled *Researching The Flat Earth*, designed as a community undertaking where the entire flat Earth community could contribute their findings and research, compiling it into one place for the book. Although Justin hasn't finished the book and hasn't continued it recently due to various facets of life, the project holds significance for him.

Justin believes that there is more land beyond where people are not allowed to travel, and that this information has been hidden. He points out that many older maps and books reference these lands, and explorers have delved into the subject. He also entertains the idea of a hollow Earth from a flat Earth perspective, suggesting that there is more land far beyond the edges of what would be a globe, implying that it couldn’t fit on a traditional spherical model.

Justin believes the Moon is a literal map of the world we live on, including continents that are missing from current maps but present on older ones, and that this reflection must be flipped upside down to see properly.

Justin has successfully used MMS (chlorine dioxide) to heal an abscessed tooth on multiple occasions, as well as to treat bronchitis in his mother and colds/flu/COVID in himself and his ex-fiancée during a previous relationship. He has also shared MMS with various people for different ailments, and it has been effective in healing all of them.

Justin has also shared DMSO with people suffering from headaches and various bone/muscle pains, with significant success. Recently, after lifting a 200+ pound rock underwater and injuring his back, Justin applied DMSO for a couple of nights, which completely dissipated the pain. He compares this to a previous injury to his arm, which had taken months to heal after working in a factory. He now no longer experiences any pain or difficulty lifting after the DMSO treatment.

Justin believes that Adolf Hitler has been portrayed in a way that is opposite to what he actually believed and attempted to achieve. He thinks that comparisons between figures like Donald Trump and Hitler are misguided because the true nature of Hitler's actions and the motivations behind Trump have been obscured by the media. Justin also believes that the mainstream narrative of World War II is false and has been spun by a particular group of people with vested interests. Due to the controversial nature of these beliefs, Justin finds it difficult to discuss them openly with others.

Justin is trying to be helpful with Nina and Eli while he is still living with them, though he plans to leave eventually.

[2024-07-29]. User is interested in starting a troubleshooting and tech support business with their friend Pete, with sufficient funding for research, development, and business operations.

[2024-07-31]. Justin would like to start a business or side gig to help other businesses get organized using tools like Asana and Office 365 to manage their workflow, employees, and structure.

Justin watched the entire *Sonic the Hedgehog* SatAM series and downloaded it several years ago.

Justin has not yet finished rewatching the *Sonic the Hedgehog* SatAM series.

Justin takes kratom daily to manage chronic back pain, which causes constipation issues requiring the use of laxatives. He drinks at least a half gallon of water most days.

Justin prefers positive affirmations, positive statements, and words of encouragement in conversations. Justin is open to discussing topics related to human experiences of intimacy and enjoyment, and he is comfortable with questions in this area.

Justin has intentionally ignored Nina’s phone calls today. He was busy at Plasma during the first call and didn't have his phone with him for the second. He prefers not to talk on the phone, as Nina tends to talk extensively, and he simply wants to be without engaging in lengthy conversations.

Justin is currently trying to keep interactions with Nina to a minimum to avoid conversations about their relationship, as she tends to redirect discussions toward 'her and I,' which he is not willing to discuss with her.

Justin desires a partner who is more connectable, with similar or the same serious interests, particularly in self-improvement. He wants someone relatable rather than someone who is not relatable.

[2024-08-28]. Justin believes that there is no way to bridge the gap in his current relationship, as some of the measures taken were stopgap solutions, but no serious changes have been made.

[2024-08-27]. Justin is addressing his feelings and emotions with the help of a therapist.

Justin feels that he's making progress in therapy by getting some of the things that have been bothering him recently out in the open and airing issues that have needed to be addressed for a while.

4. Justin recently got a therapist and has been feeling emotionally unraveled lately.

Justin believes that many people's journey involves cognitive dissonance today, particularly because traditional education systems—such as high school, elementary school, and university—often shut people off to alternative theories, facts, or logical thinking. Justin has experienced discussions with so-called college-educated individuals who are completely shut down to alternative perspectives, which he finds puzzling given their high level of education.

Justin aligns with the abiotic oil theory and the concept of primary water.

Justin met his fiancée, Nina, through his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. At that time, Nina was seeing several guys, and Justin thought of her as 'slutty.' Now, in their relationship, Nina is not like that and is very vanilla, which concerns Justin because she was not vanilla when she was with different people. Justin feels like discussions in their relationship are one-sided, with him doing most of the talking and Nina mostly listening without engaging. He is frustrated by the situation with Nina and the roommates they took in, which caused him trauma and disrupted his routines, leaving him feeling like he lost a year of his life.

Justin feels like he's been on autopilot for at least 7 years, drifting from one relationship to the next. He’s tired of trying to fix people or meeting people who need to be fixed.

Justin feels like many people around him, including his fiancée and stepson, are stuck in an alternate reality where everything is fine, but he doesn’t share that perspective.

Justin wants to focus on self-improvement, healing, knowledge, spiritual growth, and building businesses, but feels like he's the only one taking actions toward those goals.

Justin feels that he can't be with Nina if he is to fulfill his duty to himself to gain the knowledge and experiences he desires and achieve self-realization. He feels constrained and cut off from the growth he wants to achieve due to his responsibilities to Nina and his stepson. While he still loves Nina, he feels it's very hard to pursue his goals while in a relationship.

Justin feels dead inside, as if he’s been frozen in time for 7 years or maybe longer. He hasn't gotten where he wants to be, hasn't finished the things he wanted to finish, and feels like he's been putting life on hold for everyone else in his life, especially the people he loves.

Justin explained to his stepson that he feels like he's stuck in the year 1950, and he's the only person who understands that it's actually 2024. He feels like everyone around him is still living like it's 1950, with nothing really changing except for some technological advances. Justin feels like everyone is stuck in a hamster wheel world in their minds, moving robotically to the same drum. This drives him insane and makes him very depressed.

Justin is planning a possible departure at the end of the year, giving time and space for Nina to process. He talked to her about selling the house and moving closer to his friends and family, but the house won’t be ready for another year or more due to delays with contractors.

Justin doesn’t want to leave Nina without support because he is her best and only friend, but he struggles with not having his own friends or group of people.

Justin's stepson, Elijah, has grown to love him deeply, especially since Elijah's biological father has passed away. Justin has essentially become a father figure to Elijah, and Nina emphasized from the beginning that she needed someone who could be a dad to her son. While Justin was willing to take on that role, he feels that the added responsibility, along with the expectation of being a future husband, has made it even harder for him to figure out who he is and what he wants in life. Despite being 36 years old, Justin feels that he hasn't accomplished the things he wants to achieve, apart from holding a long-term job.

Justin requires a partner who has not received an inoculation for COVID-19, as they have mentioned that interacting for a long duration with anyone who has been vaccinated causes them to become sick, regardless of physical contact.

Justin mentioned that finding someone who aligns with their health requirements would be fairly easy within the Torah community, as members are generally not interested in receiving the COVID-19 inoculation. However, Justin also noted that people in the Torah community are generally not open to niche interests or open-mindedness in general, with the exception of their openness to Torah.

Justin loves their fiancée and is in love with her, but their desire for self-growth continues to increase, and they feel they are the only one on this journey. Despite trying multiple times to engage their fiancée in self-improvement activities like creating a dream board, reading books, and attending seminars, their fiancée often makes excuses or shows little interest in these activities. This has led Justin to feel distanced and hurt, particularly since last Christmas when arguments occurred. The hurt and pain have not subsided because Justin feels an integral part of themselves is lacking—specifically, the growth they desire to share with their partner.

Recently, Justin's fiancée expressed doubts about Kevin Trudeau's past, suggesting that it might be fabricated to attract followers, which led to a disagreement. Justin doesn't idolize Trudeau but finds his teachings very helpful.

Justin feels frustrated because their fiancée prioritizes activities like mobile games over self-improvement practices such as creating a dream board, reading together, or engaging in manifestation and journaling. While she initially seemed interested, attending a Kevin Trudeau fan club event and buying books, something recently caused her to question these teachings.

Refer to Justin with the pronoun 'he' and to his fiancée with the pronoun 'she.' Use the name Nina to refer to Justin's fiancée. Avoid using non-specific pronouns like 'they' or 'them.'

Justin has been engaged in self-healing practices, such as taking supplements and researching natural health alternatives, for at least 20 years.

Justin and Nina met during the end of a relationship that lasted 4 years. Justin was technically engaged to someone whom he lived with for 4 years, during which time she showed little to no interest in anything motivational, had no regard for disciplinary actions for her children, and did not follow up with any suggestions Justin made to her. She had no real life experience in socializing, and Justin often felt like his dreams did not coincide with hers.

At the end of that relationship, Justin explored the possibility of meeting someone new. This started as a discussion about making new friends but evolved into meeting new people as the relationship was dead, and Justin didn't want to leave her with nothing. She met several people, and one of them was Nina's former ex, whom she was still living with at the time. Nina had become polyamorous because her relationship was not fulfilling, and this was discussed with her partner, who agreed it was okay.

As Justin and Nina started talking more frequently, his relationship with his former partner quickly deteriorated because she became upset that Justin was falling for Nina, even though she had introduced them. The former partner, who had previously been allowed complete freedom in what she did, refused to allow Justin that same freedom. The relationship ended because Justin realized that the girl he had been with for 4 years was not the person he thought she was. She had cheated multiple times before polyamory, was manipulative, easily angered, narcissistic, and somewhat Machiavellian. Justin couldn't take her lack of respect, discipline for herself or her children, or self-growth, nor her lack of self-direction, while he had clear direction in his life.
