## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

You’re right—**extra batteries** carried on Sam do **not recharge vehicles** like transport bikes. The **batteries you equip** only extend Sam’s **suit’s power** for things like **Active Skeletons**, which can help with traversal on foot but won’t transfer their energy to your bike.

Here’s how to manage your **bike’s battery** effectively without relying on extra suit batteries:

### **How to Extend Your Bike’s Battery Life**
1. **Use Generators**:
   - **Generators** are your best friend for keeping your bike charged.
   - Place them strategically along your planned route, especially in areas where you’ll use **boost** frequently or expect long travel times.
   - Other players’ generators can also be used, so check the **Chiral Network** for existing ones before setting out.

2. **Plan Routes with Charging Stops**:
   - Map out routes that pass by **generators** or **Timefall Shelters** (some shelters have charging capabilities).
   - Avoid detours or high-energy boosts unless absolutely necessary.

3. **Avoid Draining Boost**:
   - Use the **boost function sparingly**. Constant boosting drains the bike’s battery quickly, especially when climbing steep slopes or uneven terrain.
   - Save boosts for essential moments, such as clearing gaps or speeding through BT zones.

4. **Stick to Chiral Roads** (If Available):
   - Traveling on **Chiral Roads** doesn’t drain your bike’s battery. If you’ve completed the Auto-Paver network in the **Central Region**, make use of roads as much as possible.

5. **Build Charging Infrastructure**:
   - If you’re setting up a zipline or exploring a rugged area, build **generators** near challenging sections so you can recharge while working.

6. **Carry a Backup Vehicle** (Optional):
   - If you anticipate running out of power far from any generator, consider leaving a **second bike or truck** at a nearby facility as a backup. This is especially useful in remote regions like **Hartman’s Lab** or the **Old Volcano Observatory**.

### **Do Extra Batteries Help Indirectly?**
While extra batteries don’t help the bike directly, they can:
- **Keep Your Active Skeleton Powered**:
   - Active Skeletons like the **Speed Skeleton** or **All-Terrain Skeleton** can help you traverse terrain on foot more efficiently if your bike runs out of power.
- **Serve as a Backup Plan**:
   - If your bike dies, having extended battery power for your suit ensures you can continue to explore or reach a generator safely.

---

### **Final Takeaway**
Instead of carrying extra batteries, focus on **building or locating generators** and **planning efficient routes** to ensure your bike stays powered. With good generator placement and smart use of the boost function, you’ll rarely find yourself stranded without battery power.

If you want advice on planning routes or where to build generators in specific areas, let me know—I’m happy to help!

Absolutely! Donating **Chiral Crystals** to **preppers**, **facilities**, and **distribution centers** is a fantastic way to maintain and enhance your network and infrastructure in *Death Stranding*. This can help repair and maintain **structures**, support the **Chiral Network**, and assist other players who rely on shared resources. Here's a breakdown of how to use your **Chiral Crystals** effectively:

---

### **Benefits of Donating Chiral Crystals**
1. **Infrastructure Maintenance**:
   - Facilities use donated **Chiral Crystals** to maintain and repair shared structures like **ziplines**, **bridges**, **roads**, and **generators**.
   - This ensures that the **world you’ve built** (and contributed to) remains functional for you and other players.

2. **Increases Facility Connection**:
   - Donating **Chiral Crystals** can earn **likes** and increase your **Connection Level** with facilities and preppers, improving bandwidth and unlocking new rewards.

3. **Community Support**:
   - Donations benefit the **social strand system** by helping other players use structures in your shared world.

4. **Frees Up Inventory**:
   - If your inventory is overflowing with **Chiral Crystals**, donating is an excellent way to lighten your load while still making good use of them.

---

### **When to Prioritize Donating Chiral Crystals**
1. **Maintaining Structures**:
   - If you notice **roads**, **ziplines**, or other infrastructure beginning to deteriorate, prioritize donating to nearby facilities that handle those structures.
   - For example:
     - **Auto-pavers** for roads.
     - Facilities near zipline networks.

2. **Helping Preppers and Facilities**:
   - If you’re working on maxing out the **Connection Level** with specific preppers or distribution centers, donating **Chiral Crystals** is a great way to earn extra **likes**.

3. **Endgame Resource Management**:
   - In the **post-game**, you’ll likely have an abundance of **Chiral Crystals** from defeating BTs and exploring. Use these to maintain the infrastructure you’ve built throughout the game.

---

### **Best Places to Donate Chiral Crystals**
1. **Auto-Pavers (Central Region)**:
   - Auto-pavers are essential for repairing and completing roads, which greatly improve traversal.
   - Roads require **Chiral Crystals**, along with metals and ceramics, so donating here ensures smoother journeys for everyone.

2. **Zipline Networks**:
   - Facilities near **mountains**, **rough terrain**, or **hard-to-reach areas** (e.g., Weather Station, Roboticist, Mountain Knot City) often support **zipline networks**.
   - Donating helps maintain these crucial structures.

3. **Preppers and Facilities**:
   - Facilities that rely on frequent deliveries or are in remote locations (e.g., Hartman’s Lab, The Paleontologist) benefit greatly from donated crystals.

---

### **Tips for Managing Chiral Crystals**
1. **Farm Efficiently**:
   - Regularly clear BT zones to stock up on **Chiral Crystals**.
   - Large BT encounters (like **catcher BTs**) drop significant amounts.

2. **Track Donations**:
   - Use the **map** to see where donations are most needed based on deteriorating structures or facilities with low connection levels.

3. **Balance Personal and Shared Use**:
   - Keep some **Chiral Crystals** for your own use (e.g., building ziplines, repairing gear) while donating the surplus.

---

### **Why Donations Enhance the Experience**
1. **Social Strand System**:
   - Donating **Chiral Crystals** reinforces the **connection between players**, which is the core theme of *Death Stranding*.

2. **Sense of Contribution**:
   - By maintaining and enhancing the shared world, you leave a lasting legacy that benefits other players who traverse the same paths.

3. **Rewards**:
   - Increased **facility levels** unlock rewards, including upgrades, materials, and gear.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
Donating **Chiral Crystals** is a small but impactful way to support the **world-building aspect** of *Death Stranding*. It ties directly into the game’s core message of **connecting and helping others** while improving your own experience.
