## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Here’s a reversed version of the song, starting from the end and working backward in spirit while maintaining rhyme and flow:

---

Is you!  
You!  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.  
Wow-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh.  
Ooh-ooh, oh...  

I just want you for my own,  
More than you could ever know.  
Make my wish come true—  

All I want for Christmas...  
This is all I’m askin’ for.  
I just wanna see my baby  
Standin’ right outside my door.  

Santa, won’t you bring me the one I really need?  
Won’t you please bring my baby to me?  
And everyone is singing!  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing...  
The sound of children’s laughter fills the air,  
And the lights are shining brightly everywhere.  

What more can I do?  
I just want you here tonight,  
Holdin’ on to me so tight.  
I won’t even stay up late  
To hear those magical reindeers click.  
I won’t make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for St. Nick.  
I’m just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe.  

I won’t ask for much this Christmas,  
I won’t even wish for snow.  

All I want for Christmas is you!  
Ooh, baby.  
Make my wish come true.  
I just want you for my own,  
More than you could ever know.  
Santa Claus won’t make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day.  
I don’t need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace.  
Don’t care about those presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree.  

I don’t want a lot for Christmas,  
There is just one thing I need.  

Yeah!  
All I want for Christmas is you.  

Make my wish come true.  
I just want you for my own,  
More than you will ever know.  
Underneath the Christmas tree.  
I don’t care about the presents.  
There is just one thing I need.  
I don’t want a lot for Christmas.
