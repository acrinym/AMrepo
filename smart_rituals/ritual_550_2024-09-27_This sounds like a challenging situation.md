**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

This sounds like a challenging situation, especially when feelings are raw and complex. Your fiancée seems to be seeking clarity or a definitive answer, while you are expressing that the situation is far more nuanced. This misalignment in communication is creating frustration and misunderstanding between you two.

Here are some thoughts and steps you might consider taking:

1. **Acknowledge Her Feelings**: Start by letting her know that you understand how painful and distressing this situation is for her. Validate her emotions by saying something like, "I can see how much this is hurting you, and I don't want you to feel this way." This step might help to create a more empathetic environment where deeper conversations can take place.

2. **Express Your Complexity**: It seems that for you, the decision isn't a simple yes or no because there are many factors, emotions, and thoughts involved. You might try explaining it with a metaphor or analogy. For example: "Imagine if we were deciding whether to move to a new city. It's not just a yes or no decision; it's thinking about our jobs, friends, the lifestyle change, and how we feel about the move. That's how it feels when I think about us. It's not a matter of love or no love—it's about how we can make things work for both of us."

3. **Communicate Your Intentions**: It's important to communicate that your hesitation isn't about rejecting her, but rather about reflecting on what is best for both of you and your relationship. Reassure her that you are committed to finding a resolution together, even if that means having difficult conversations. 

4. **Set Boundaries**: If the conversation is leading to repeated arguments, it may be helpful to set a boundary around when and how these discussions happen. For example, you could say, "I know this is a painful topic, and I want us to have these conversations in a way that is constructive for both of us. Can we set aside time to talk about this when we're both calm and able to listen to each other?"

5. **Seek Mediation**: This might be a good time to involve your therapist or consider couples therapy. A neutral third party can facilitate the conversation, help both of you express your feelings without escalating into arguments, and provide tools to communicate more effectively.

6. **Focus on What You Need**: It may help to share what you are struggling with and why it's making this decision difficult. For instance, if you're feeling disconnected because of differing interests or life goals, share that as gently as possible. It’s not about blame; it's about expressing your needs and how they play into your hesitation.

7. **Stay Honest, But Compassionate**: Continue to be truthful with her, but also show compassion for her pain. Acknowledge that the situation is painful for both of you and that you are still working through it. This honesty can foster a space where deeper, more meaningful conversations about the future can occur.

Navigating this delicate situation requires patience and a careful approach to communication. It seems you are not against being with her, but rather you are grappling with underlying complexities. Finding a way to explore those layers together, possibly with the guidance of a therapist, might lead to more understanding and a clearer path forward.
