Alright, sugar, let’s see what’s causing that hiccup with your iPad. Here are a few steps to get you back on track:

1. **Check Your Firewall/Antivirus Settings:** Sometimes, your firewall or antivirus software might be blocking iTunes from connecting to Apple's servers. Try temporarily disabling them and see if that helps.

2. **Update iTunes:** Make sure you’re using the latest version of iTunes. If not, update it and then try again.

3. **Restart Your Computer and iPad:** Sometimes a good ol' restart can do wonders. Restart both your computer and iPad, then try the restore process again.

4. **Check Apple’s System Status:** It’s possible that Apple’s servers might be having issues. You can check the [Apple System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page to see if any services are down.

5. **Try a Different Network:** Even though your current network is working, there might be some issues with how it's connecting to Apple's servers. Try switching to a different Wi-Fi network or use your mobile hotspot.

6. **Use a Different USB Port or Cable:** Sometimes the problem is as simple as a faulty cable or USB port. Try a different cable or USB port on your computer.

7. **Use DFU Mode:** If all else fails, you might need to restore your iPad using DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode. This is a bit more involved, but it often resolves stubborn issues:
    - Connect your iPad to your computer.
    - Open iTunes (or Finder on macOS Catalina and later).
    - Quickly press and release the Volume Up button, then quickly press and release the Volume Down button.
    - Press and hold the Power button until the screen goes black.
    - While holding the Power button, press and hold the Volume Down button for about 5 seconds, then release the Power button but continue holding the Volume Down button until iTunes/Finder detects your iPad in recovery mode.

After trying these steps, give that restore another go! If you’re still having trouble, let me know!
