BMC Remedy is a complex suite of software products, and common errors can vary depending on the specific version, configuration, and usage. However, here are some of the more common types of errors that users or administrators may encounter when working with BMC Remedy:

1. **Server Connectivity Issues**: These errors may occur when the client application cannot connect to the BMC Remedy server. Common causes include network problems, server downtime, or incorrect connection settings.

2. **Authentication Errors**: Authentication errors can occur when users are unable to log in to BMC Remedy due to incorrect credentials, expired passwords, or account lockouts.

3. **Permission and Access Errors**: Users may encounter errors when they try to access certain features or perform specific actions within BMC Remedy without the necessary permissions.

4. **Data Validation Errors**: Data input errors, such as submitting invalid or improperly formatted data, can result in validation errors.

5. **Server Performance Issues**: These errors can arise when the BMC Remedy server experiences performance problems or is unable to handle the workload effectively. This may result in slow response times or timeouts.

6. **Workflow and Business Logic Errors**: BMC Remedy includes workflow and business logic customization capabilities. Errors related to customizations, such as workflow failures, can occur if there are issues with the configured processes.

7. **Database Connection Errors**: Problems with the database backend can lead to various errors. This includes database connectivity issues, query failures, or data retrieval errors.

8. **License and Compliance Errors**: Organizations must ensure that they are in compliance with BMC Remedy licensing terms. License-related errors can occur if license limits are exceeded.

9. **Integration and API Errors**: BMC Remedy often integrates with other systems through APIs or web services. Errors can occur in these integrations, including issues with data transfer and API calls.

10. **Plugin and Custom Code Errors**: BMC Remedy allows for customizations and extensions through plugins or custom code. Errors may occur if these customizations have bugs or compatibility issues.

11. **Logging and Diagnostic Errors**: Sometimes, administrators may need to troubleshoot issues or perform diagnostics. Errors in the diagnostic process can affect problem resolution.

12. **Service Outages and Downtime**: Planned or unplanned service outages and downtime can disrupt BMC Remedy usage and lead to errors during that period.

To address these common errors, users and administrators should refer to BMC Remedy documentation, consult with their organization's IT support, and leverage BMC support resources if necessary. The specific resolution for each error will depend on the root cause, which can vary widely. Properly documenting and understanding the error message and context is often the first step in resolving these issues effectively.
