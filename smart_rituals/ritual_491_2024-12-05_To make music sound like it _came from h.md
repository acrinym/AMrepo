Combining any of these styles and techniques can result in music that sounds like it was forged in the depths of hell, perfect for unsettling or nightmarish settings!

---

Using **actual "magic words"** from historical grimoires or texts like *The Lesser Key of Solomon* (*Ars Goetia*) or *The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage* can definitely deepen the authenticity of a demonic chant-like song. These words often have phonetic power and a mystique that fits perfectly into this type of project.

Here’s a **demonic chant-based song** incorporating magic words, particularly drawing from Abramelin’s words of power and other evocative grimoires.

Here’s a **magical summoning chant** specifically tailored for requesting **mechanical assistance**, drawing inspiration from occult traditions like *Hermetic magic*, *chaos magic*, and *practical invocation*. This is designed as a lyrical framework with an arcane vibe, focusing on summoning entities or energies tied to machinery, gears, and engineering.

---

### **Title: "Invocation of Mechanos"**

*(Intro)*  
Oh, spirits of cog and wheel,  
Hear the call, let engines heal.  
Through brass and steel, through spark and flame,  
By ancient gears, I speak your name.  

*(Chant Verse 1)*  
Mechanos, lord of grind and flow,  
Keeper of motion, let circuits glow.  
Forge the path where bolts have rusted,  
Grant your touch, machines entrusted.  

Kzzrak-naath, vrinn-kaah-tor,  
Sha’bel-kron, vass’eth-lor.  
By torque and tension, by screw and blade,  
Turn the wheel, let work be made.  

*(Chorus)*  
Zarath—grinneth—Machinath-korr,  
Bind the bolts, restore the core.  
Spirits of oil, brass, and steam,  
Bring to life the mechanic’s dream.  

*(Chant Verse 2)*  
Oh, gears that grind in ancient halls,  
Move once more where silence calls.  
Shun the rust, release the spark,  
Let engines rise from the dark.  

Tethrok-zahl, vree-zor-ran,  
Klonneth-vaas, shanneth-kan.  
With hammer’s blow and welder’s fire,  
Rebuild anew what fate conspired.  

*(Chorus)*  
Zarath—grinneth—Machinath-korr,  
Bind the bolts, restore the core.  
Spirits of oil, brass, and steam,  
Bring to life the mechanic’s dream.  

*(Bridge)*  
Oh, specter of iron, grant me might,  
Turn the wrenches, set it right.  
From bearing’s groan to piston’s cry,  
Heal the machine, let it not die.  

Klorr-vass, breth-tahl, mechan’zar,  
By forge’s heart, by blacksmith’s star.  
Work the levers, mend the chain,  
Bring order back to chaos’ reign.  

*(Outro)*  
Mechanos, I thank your name,  
Through your power, restore the frame.  
When the cogs have ceased to turn,  
In your honor, the flame shall burn.  

---

### **Key Concepts for Mechanical Summoning**:
1. **Mechanos**: A symbolic entity embodying machinery and engineering. Think of it as a "spirit of motion."
2. **Mystic Language**: Words like *Kzzrak*, *Tethrok-zahl*, and *Klorr-vass* evoke a mechanical, arcane feel, resonating with the metal-and-gears theme.
3. **Practical Requests**: The lyrics focus on restoring broken mechanisms, invoking precision and flow in machinery.
4. **Energy Invocation**: Mentions of "spark," "forge," "flame," and "motion" tie into powering and reviving mechanical systems.

This could pair beautifully with a dark ambient or industrial music style, reinforcing the vibe of ancient gears grinding back to life under a mystical invocation. A true summoning for the mechanic or tinkerer at heart! 🔧✨

### **Title: "Chant of the Abyss"**

*(Intro)*  
Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas!  
Spirits unclean, rise from thy lairs.  
By the names that shatter the veil,  
I call thee forth, infernal and frail.  

---

*(Verse 1)*  
O Asmodeus, lord of flame,  
Thy power I summon, thy wrath I claim.  
Beelzebub, thou prince of flies,  
Bring forth thy swarm ‘neath darkened skies.  

Baal, great master of the night,  
Show thy visage, grant thy might.  
Astaroth, queen of infernal lore,  
Unlock the gates, the unholy door.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Arise, arise, from depths untold,  
Through fire and shadow, through ash and cold.  
I bind thee, spirits, by this decree,  
To walk the earth and answer me.  

---

*(Verse 2)*  
By the seal of Solomon, I break thy chains,  
Let wrath and ruin course through thy veins.  
By Tetragrammaton, Elohim, Shaddai,  
I summon thee, powers that never die.  

Oh spirits vile, whose names are lost,  
I pay the price, whatever the cost.  
Come forth, Azazel, Leviathan’s tide,  
Let chaos reign, let worlds collide.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Arise, arise, from depths untold,  
Through fire and shadow, through ash and cold.  
I bind thee, spirits, by this decree,  
To walk the earth and answer me.  

---

*(Bridge)*  
(*Low chants overlap in a cacophony of names and invocations.*)  
Alash tad alash tal ashtu,  
Erset la tari, ashtu malku.  
Ia Ia Zazathoth! Ia Ia Nyarlathotep!  
Bring forth the void, tear the net!  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Arise, arise, from depths untold,  
Through fire and shadow, through ash and cold.  
I bind thee, spirits, by this decree,  
To walk the earth and answer me.  

---

*(Outro)*  
(*Haunting whispers fade into silence.*)  
By these names, I speak thy doom,  
Rise unholy, from thy tomb.  
Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas…  

---

Here’s a **weekend pagan spell of discord** transformed into a song, blending mystical imagery, poetic chants, and a focus on chaos. It’s rhythmic and evocative, perfect for setting an atmospheric tone.

---

### **Title: "Winds of Discord"**

*(Intro)*  
(*Soft drums and whispered chants build a rhythmic pulse.*)  
Oh winds of chaos, rise and dance,  
Turn the world with a fractured glance.  
Through word and fire, through shadow’s flight,  
We call on thee this witching night.  

---

*(Verse 1)*  
Beneath the moon, in shadows cast,  
We break the ties that hold too fast.  
A flame, a thread, a shard of glass,  
Let discord grow as echoes pass.  

By ash and smoke, by thorn and vine,  
Undo the bonds that intertwine.  
With words unspoken, threads unwind,  
Leave shattered calm and fractured mind.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Spirits of discord, hear our plea,  
Twist the fates and set them free.  
From silence comes a storm unchained,  
Through chaos let the world be strained.  

---

*(Verse 2)*  
With salt and flame, the circle’s drawn,  
By twisted will, let peace be gone.  
A shattered mirror, a broken vow,  
Let balance fall, disrupt it now.  

The cauldron stirs with sparks of spite,  
Through twisted paths, we shape the night.  
A cry of winds, a clash of tides,  
Unleash the force that fate divides.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Spirits of discord, hear our plea,  
Twist the fates and set them free.  
From silence comes a storm unchained,  
Through chaos let the world be strained.  

---

*(Bridge)*  
(*Chant-like, layered voices rising and falling*)  
Ankara vahl, the web shall fray,  
Through storm and strife, lead them astray.  
By thorn of rose and crow’s sharp cry,  
Let harmony falter and wither, die.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Spirits of discord, hear our plea,  
Twist the fates and set them free.  
From silence comes a storm unchained,  
Through chaos let the world be strained.  

---

*(Outro)*  
(*Softly fading, like the spell dissipating into the ether.*)  
Oh winds of chaos, fade to rest,  
Leave the world in your unrest.  
Through word and fire, through shadow’s flight,  
We leave thee now, this witching night.  

---

### **Title: "Circle of Discord"**

*(Intro)*  
(*Low hums and drumming, with whispered words.*)  
By the moon’s pale light, by the serpent’s coil,  
We summon forth chaos, the sacred spoil.  
By the circle cast, by the spell intoned,  
Let discord reign, where peace has grown.  

---

*(Verse 1)*  
"By the candle’s flame, by salt and stone,  
I call to thee, powers unknown.  
By the blood of earth, by water’s tide,  
Unleash the force that fates divide."  

With iron sharp and thread undone,  
The spell begins, the work is spun.  
The winds shall cry, the skies shall break,  
The binding fails for chaos' sake.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
O spirits dark, by thy true name,  
Through whispered will, disrupt the flame.  
By thorn and ash, by fire and cord,  
Bring forth the chaos, discord’s accord.  

---

*(Verse 2)*  
(*Rising intensity with ceremonial chants.*)  
"An it harm none, so mote it be,"  
But harm shall rise, unleashed, set free.  
The mirror cracks, the circle bends,  
No balance now—discord ascends.  

"By blackened crow, by shadow’s breath,  
We conjure thee from realms of death.  
By candle wax and serpent’s hiss,  
Twist the thread, deliver this."  

---

*(Chorus)*  
O spirits dark, by thy true name,  
Through whispered will, disrupt the flame.  
By thorn and ash, by fire and cord,  
Bring forth the chaos, discord’s accord.  

---

*(Bridge)*  
(*Layered voices, dark and melodic.*)  
"Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas,  
By this name, the gates shall pass."  
"Aradia’s flame, descend and rise,  
Break their bonds, darken the skies."  

"Ankara vahl, the wheel shall turn,  
By force of will, let bridges burn."  
"By salt and flame, by thorn and stone,  
The spirits rise, thy will be known."  

---

*(Chorus)*  
O spirits dark, by thy true name,  
Through whispered will, disrupt the flame.  
By thorn and ash, by fire and cord,  
Bring forth the chaos, discord’s accord.  

---

*(Outro)*  
(*Soft whispers fade into a low drone.*)  
The spell is cast, the circle breaks,  
The threads of peace now torn to flakes.  
By blood and ash, by sacred flight,  
We leave thee here, this fateful night.  

---

*(Intro)*  
Hail, O darkness, thy kingdom rise,  
Under crimson moons, the old god sighs.  
With claws of ash and wings of flame,  
We chant thy glory, infernal name.  

---

*(Verse 1)*  
Beelzebub, thy whispers call,  
Through shadowed halls where angels fall.  
Leviathan stirs in the deep abyss,  
Azazel’s grin a serpentine kiss.  

By blood of lamb, by sacred night,  
The sigils burn, unholy rite.  
Through chants of woe and screams untamed,  
We summon thee, O lord unnamed.  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Come forth, O prince of fire,  
Through the veil, rise ever higher.  
By thy horn and cloven heel,  
The pact is sealed; thy fate we feel.  

---

*(Verse 2)*  
From ancient tomes where secrets writhe,  
We weave the threads of death and life.  
Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas,  
The gates are torn, chaos surpasses.  

Wings of bats and venom’s sting,  
The darkened choir begins to sing.  
Oh Lucifer, bringer of light,  
Guide us through eternal night.

(*Rhythmic clapping and stomping sounds*)  
Break the chains of holy creed,  
Set the blasphemous spirits freed.  
Through the ashes, through the flame,  
We call thee by thy infernal name!  

---

*(Chorus)*  
Come forth, O prince of fire,  
Through the veil, rise ever higher.  
By thy horn and cloven heel,  
The pact is sealed; thy fate we feel.  

---

*(Outro)*  
(*Soft whispers and rising tones, fading into laughter*)  
Dance, O shadows, in infernal glee,  
The morning star has set us free.  
Through chaos and fire, thy hymn we sing,  
To the infernal prince, our offering.
