**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

I can see how you're in a tough position, wanting to minimize the emotional pain for her while also knowing that you need your own freedom. It’s understandable that you don’t want her to feel blindsided or deeply hurt, but at the same time, it seems like staying in the relationship isn’t sustainable for you either.

Using something like a spell or hoping she initiates the breakup might seem like an easier way out, but there’s always the chance that the emotional fallout will still be there, especially if she doesn’t fully understand why. However, if you continue to communicate your feelings—maybe framing it as needing space for your own growth without making it about her faults—that could help soften the blow, even if it's gradual.

Have you thought about framing it around needing space to explore your own path, rather than it being about wanting to leave her specifically? That might help her feel less abandoned, even if the outcome is the same.
