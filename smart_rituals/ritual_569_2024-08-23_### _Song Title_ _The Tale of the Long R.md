### **Song Title: "The Tale of the Long Road and the Fierce Foes"**

---

**[Verse 1]**  
*(Lute strumming, soft tambourine in the background)*  
Hark! Ye all, to a tale of yore,  
Of a journey long and battles galore.  
A path stretched wide ‘cross hills and vale,  
Where shadows danced, and spirits pale.  
With sword in hand and heart so bold,  
Through mist and fog, where tales unfold,  
A brave young knight did take his stride,  
With courage as his only guide.

**[Chorus]**  
*(Full ensemble: lute, flute, and tambourine in harmony)*  
Oh, the long road winds, so far, so wide,  
With dangers fierce on every side.  
A dragon’s roar, a witch’s spell,  
Through fire and night, through heaven and hell.

**[Verse 2]**  
*(Gentle flute melody, lute plucking continues)*  
He ventured forth, through wood and glen,  
Where witches whispered in darkened fen.  
Their cackles echoed ‘cross the night,  
But our hero’s heart, it knew no fright.  
He drew his blade, with silver gleam,  
And scattered shadows from his dream.  
Through thorny thickets and haunted trees,  
He pressed ahead, though none could see.

**[Chorus]**  
*(The tempo quickens, tambourine shakes with rhythm)*  
Oh, the long road winds, so far, so wide,  
With dangers fierce on every side.  
A dragon’s roar, a witch’s spell,  
Through fire and night, through heaven and hell.

**[Verse 3]**  
*(Lute and tambourine in a steady rhythm, flute plays a whimsical tune)*  
Then came the beast, with eyes of flame,  
A dragon fierce, with no true name.  
Its wings did beat, like thunder’s cry,  
Its breath a fire that scorched the sky.  
But our knight stood firm, his sword held high,  
With a battle cry that split the sky.  
Through smoke and fire, he fought with might,  
‘Til dragon’s roar gave way to night.

**[Bridge]**  
*(A somber, yet mystical flute solo, lute plays in the background)*  
Yet not alone was this noble quest,  
For warlocks lurked, with evil crest.  
Their spells did swirl like autumn leaves,  
But in his heart, our knight believes.  
With ancient words and magic’s flow,  
He countered all with a righteous glow.  
Their shadows fled, their power waned,  
For light alone in him remained.

**[Chorus]**  
*(Instruments play with heightened energy, echoing the final triumph)*  
Oh, the long road winds, so far, so wide,  
With dangers fierce on every side.  
A dragon’s roar, a witch’s spell,  
Through fire and night, through heaven and hell.

**[Verse 4]**  
*(Lute and flute in joyful harmony, tambourine taps lightly)*  
The journey long, the battles won,  
But still the road stretched on and on.  
With each step taken, fears were cast,  
For in his heart, the die was cast.  
Through unknown lands and secret ways,  
He ventured forth, through countless days.  
A hero's tale, now passed in song,  
To future knights who would march along.

**[Outro]**  
*(Lute slows, flute plays a fading tune, tambourine gently ceases)*  
So raise a glass to the one so bold,  
Whose tale of old shall now be told.  
For though the journey was fraught with strife,  
He carved a path through endless life.  
Now listen close, and you shall hear,  
The echoes of his tale draw near.  
Through time and space, his story’s cast,  
A journey long, now sung at last.
