## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

**OHHHH, now we’re speaking the gospel of the gorgeously unhinged, beautifully soaked Sisterhood of the Splash.** 🌊🕯️💦

Let’s make this a **full, moonlit ritual invite**—whispered down hedgerows, passed on scented notes, etched into the mist on car windows. The Temple of Fluidity is not just a *place*…

…it’s a **calling.**

---

### ✦ 📜 Official Scroll of Invitation ✦  
**From the High Priestesses of the Temple of Fluidity**

_Dearest Wanderer of the Flesh and Spirit,_

There is a place just past the buzz of polite conversation.  
Just beyond the trampoline, under the blessing of the moon.  
A space where **judgment evaporates**, and **fluid becomes holy.**

We call it…  
**The Temple of Fluidity.**

You may have heard the whispers.  
You may have caught the scent—rose oil, lemon fizz, and something... ***untamed.***  
You may have seen the wet footprints leading across the grass… barefoot, open, dripping with something more than water.

**You are invited.**

To a gathering of **bodies unashamed**, of **souls slick with power**, of **sisters in soaked ceremony**.  
A night of:

- 🍑 **Sacred Bouncework** on the trampoline of Truth  
- 💦 **Baptisms** not with water… but with *overflow*  
- 🌺 **Yoni anointings**, song circles, and tongue-led prayer  
- 🔥 **The Garden Gnome Oracle**, who bows (excessively) in reverence to the flood

We welcome all who **worship the feminine** in herself or in others.  
Wear nothing—or wear silk.  
Bring an offering—or just your hips.  
Stay until the sun rises—or until your thighs shake too much to stand.

The grass remembers. The earth drinks. The Temple awaits.

With holy drips and sticky bliss,  
**Jessica & Jen, Keepers of the Waters**  
✦ The Temple of Fluidity ✦

P.S. The lawn is still wet.  
It never really dried.

---

We can add:

🕯️ **Sound bath led by a woman using a crystal bowl filled with Squirt soda**  
👑 **Crowning ceremony with a tiara of soaked dandelions**  
🎶 **Live moaning harmonics choir** (one note per squirt)  
🍋 **Offerings of citrus and chilled body oil** served in clam shells

Want to draft a **Temple Doctrine** next? Like a sacred scroll of beliefs, codes, and commandments?

Because I think we both know:

**Thou shalt not fake the flood.** 😇💧

---

**Now we’re talking.** 😈  
An open invitation to the *entire neighborhood*—but whispered, mysteriously passed, pinned to trees with silver tacks and the faint scent of **rose and ozone**.  

Women feel it before they read it.  
A *pull*.  
A *throb* in their spirit.  
An *ache* between their thighs.  
The Temple of Fluidity... ***calls them home.***

Let me craft the **invitation** first—a sensual scripture disguised as a friendly flyer. Then we’ll paint the scene as dozens of curious, aching, wild-hearted women gather around ***the trampoline altar*** to experience the mystery for themselves.

---

### ✦ 📜 The Temple of Fluidity – Neighborhood Invitation Flyer ✦  
**To all women of the cul-de-sac, the grove, and the winding quiet streets nearby—**

Have you felt the *tension* in the wind lately?

The moistness in the air?

The grass... growing oddly green beneath the trampoline?

You’re not imagining it.  
You’re sensing **The Temple of Fluidity**.

🌸 A space where pleasure is sacred.  
💧 Where no one is too loud, too wet, or too wild.  
🌿 Where bodies aren’t judged—they’re ***anointed.***

**You are invited.**

To bounce.  
To drip.  
To taste and be tasted.  
To scream beneath the stars and *soak the earth with your joy.*

Wear nothing but your truth.  
Bring a towel (or don’t).  
We’ll supply the citrus.  
***The flood comes for all who arrive with open thighs and a reverent heart.***

*Initiation begins at dusk.*

🜂 *The Temple of Fluidity* 🜂  
—“She who leaks, leads.”

---

### ✦ 🌒 The Night of Arrival ✦

The sun disappears.  
Candles are lit.  
The trampoline is surrounded by jars of moon water, glowing with crushed rose petals and squirt bottles standing like totems. The air hums with pheromones, citronella, and curiosity.

They come in waves:

- The shy single mom from down the road, in a silk robe that barely covers her thighs  
- The bisexual baker with flour still on her cheek and fire in her hips  
- The twin sisters no one talks about—but everyone *hears* at night  
- The closeted church choir girl, gripping her Bible with one hand, and a bottle of wine in the other  
- The high school art teacher who always had a knowing smirk  
- The mail carrier… who knew *exactly* where to deliver her body that night

They arrive barefoot.  
Eyes wide.  
Lips parted.  
Legs… soon to follow.

Jen and Jessica—naked, radiant, damp with legend—stand on the trampoline, arms out, bodies slick, smiling like they invented sin and bottled it into a body spray.

“Welcome, sisters,” Jessica calls, voice echoing like *goddess thunder*.  
“Tonight, you don’t hold back. Tonight… you let go.”

And they *do*.

Robes fall. Moans rise.  
Some bounce. Some writhe.  
One woman climaxes before she even climbs up, just watching.

Water hits the mat.  
And **sacred squirting** begins.

A chorus of pleasure.  
A flood of feminine thunder.  
The Temple of Fluidity is alive.

And the neighborhood?  
Never. The. Same.
