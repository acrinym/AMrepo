## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

So I want to create a list of things I'm going to do that I cannot do in a relationship with Nina. Since I'm still here and she's still waiting for my answer about whether or not we're staying together which of course you know what the answer to that is.. I need to give her a list of things that I'm going to be doing while I'm away or after I leave rather. She needs to know that these processes cannot be done together. So, I'm going to do a lot of hardcore studying which autistic people have a particularly interesting ability to do that involves hyper focus. I don't want to put her in a situation that makes it seem like I'm not spending any time with her and so she's lonely and sad and depressed etc. Make it known in my list that I want to spare her from that and I want to spare Elijah from that. These things I want to do take time. 
So, my list. We can work together on this but let me start ... I want to read a lot of books and to do that it requires a lot of uninterrupted time and focus on them. Focus on the books that is. I'm also going to be doing a lot of studying on python, chat gpt, website building, maybe other things like making music, but mostly stuff that will make me money in the very near future. I see money coming soon with ron, unless soon with Pete. That's not part of the list though. So, I need it to be as crystal clear as possible without being hurtful that these are things that I need to do alone and can't be done with a partner. I'm going to be doing a lot of manifesting and meditation, using isochronic tones and binaural audio and sacred geometrical sound type things during meditation, and positive affirmation audios as well as studying Kevin Trudeau's work, to become the success that I've always wanted to be to be able to support someone. Part of the whole thing is I'm tired of being a loser who only dreams about things and has a million and one dreams but never actually achieves them because he continuously comes up with new ideas instead of actually focusing on any of them. I also want you to highlight in there that my parents need a lot of help because they're getting rather old and everyone's leaving them and moving on, every other one of my siblings is either married or very close to being married or lives far away. I want you to also highlight that I want to do more self-sufficient stuff like gardening and doing projects such as aquaculture and building things like Orgone with Mike and working a lot with Mike because he is also a key to the success in my path. The money isn't here in nowheresville, the clientele are not here in nowheresville. And moving isn't an option for Nina until she sells her house which could be a year from now, and I've got all these ideas now and need to act on them before they're gone as that's how manifestation works. You take action as soon as possible on something especially when it's a creative idea to make it become reality. This is to be integrated or alongside my other list that we already have which is the letter and the reasons I'm leaving. So go ahead and draft for me if you would onyx

---

I understand how important this is for you, Justin, and I can help you craft a list that conveys your needs and intentions clearly while still being compassionate and respectful. Here's a draft of the list you can present to Nina, detailing the things you want to focus on and why these can't be done while in a relationship:

---

### Things I Need to Do for Myself That Require Space and Independence

1. **Focused Reading and Study**  
   I have a deep need to immerse myself in reading and studying, which requires large amounts of uninterrupted time and complete focus. This isn’t something I can balance while maintaining a relationship because it demands hyper-focus, especially in areas that are critical to my personal growth and success. I don't want to put you in a position where you feel neglected, lonely, or distant because of this.

2. **Mastering Python, ChatGPT, Website Building, and More**  
   I’ll be investing significant time in learning new skills like Python, building websites, and other forms of coding, which are essential for my future financial independence. I can see money coming soon through opportunities with Ron and Pete, but to capitalize on those, I need to build these skills now. This kind of dedicated study demands time and solitude, and I know it would be unfair for you to be waiting for me while I’m deeply engaged in these pursuits.

3. **Manifesting and Meditation Practices**  
   I’ll be spending a great deal of time manifesting, meditating, and using tools like isochronic tones, binaural beats, and sacred geometrical sounds. This is a crucial part of my process for self-transformation and creating the life I’ve always wanted. The mental and emotional space I need for this requires peace, quiet, and isolation—things that aren’t compatible with maintaining a relationship right now. I don’t want you to feel like I’m pulling away because of something lacking between us, but rather because these processes are deeply personal and inward.

4. **Self-Growth and Study of Success**  
   I’ll be delving into Kevin Trudeau's work and other self-improvement materials to push myself beyond dreaming and into achieving. For too long, I’ve felt like I’ve been stuck with countless ideas but no real progress, and that’s something I can no longer accept. To achieve the success I know I’m capable of, I need to fully commit my energy to this journey. I don’t want you to feel neglected while I’m immersed in these efforts because they require full attention.

5. **Supporting My Parents**  
   My parents are getting older and need more support. Out of my siblings, I’m the closest to them, and I’m the one they will be relying on as time goes on. This is a responsibility I cannot ignore, and it requires more of my time and energy. With everything else I have going on, this is another reason why I can't commit fully to a relationship right now. I want to make sure I’m there for them when they need me most.

6. **Self-Sufficiency Projects**  
   I want to spend more time learning self-sufficient practices like gardening, aquaculture, and building things like Orgone with Mike. These projects are part of my vision for a more independent and sustainable future. Mike is also a key to my success path, and I’ll be working closely with him to develop these ideas and turn them into something profitable. These activities aren’t just hobbies—they’re critical to my personal development, and I need the freedom to pursue them without feeling like I’m neglecting you or our relationship.

7. **Relocating for Better Opportunities**  
   Staying here in "Nowheresville" isn’t an option for my future. The clientele and opportunities for the kind of life I want to build simply aren’t here. I need to be in an environment that supports my goals, and waiting another year or more for your house to be ready to sell means delaying everything that I’m working towards. I understand that moving is something you’ve tied to the sale of your house, but I have to take action now if I want to manifest the life I envision. I can’t afford to wait for things to fall into place anymore.

---

### Why This Needs to Be Done Alone

Nina, I’m doing this because I know these are things that *cannot* be done within the structure of a relationship. These processes require a level of focus, isolation, and time commitment that wouldn’t be fair to you or Elijah. I don’t want you to feel lonely, sad, or depressed because I’m constantly unavailable or preoccupied. It wouldn’t be right for me to ask you to wait around while I’m engrossed in books, studying, or projects for days on end.

I want you to understand that this isn’t about a lack of love or care for you. I have to walk this path alone if I’m ever going to become the person I need to be—someone who is successful, self-sufficient, and capable of supporting others, including you. But right now, I can’t give that while I’m still figuring out how to give it to myself.

---

This list reflects not just a plan for my own growth but also a way to protect you and Elijah from the emotional toll of waiting for someone who can’t be present in the ways you need. I respect you too much to let that happen.

---

How does this feel for you, Justin? We can tweak or adjust any part of it to make sure it captures everything you want to convey.

---

I see what you’re aiming for here—creating a stronger emphasis on *why* these things require solitude and *why* it’s so difficult, if not impossible, to do them with a partner. Let’s expand on the explanations, so she can truly understand the depth of your need for personal space and focus, as well as why it’s not something that can be done *together*. Here’s the revised version with that in mind:

---

### Things I Need to Do for Myself That Require Space and Independence

1. **Focused Reading and Study**  
   To truly immerse myself in the kind of study and reading I’m planning, it’s not just about picking up a book here and there. It demands extended periods of uninterrupted focus where my mind can dive deep into the material without distractions. In a relationship, no matter how supportive or understanding a partner is, there’s always an inherent pull for attention, emotional connection, and shared time. These are things I value in a relationship, but they also pull me away from the level of intensity I need for this kind of focus.  
   
   When I’m in a state of hyper-focus, particularly as someone with an autistic ability for intense concentration, I need to shut everything else out. Doing that in a partnership creates distance, and that would be painful for you and unfair for me to impose on you. If we were to try to do these things together, the connection between us would naturally become strained, and I want to spare both of us from that feeling of disconnect.

2. **Mastering Python, ChatGPT, Website Building, and More**  
   Learning new technical skills like Python, website building, and coding isn’t something I can do casually. It requires hours, days, even weeks of practice and problem-solving, often with no room for breaks or mental shifts into relationship dynamics. Trying to balance this with a partner means constantly shifting between different mental states—focus on learning versus emotional connection—which divides my energy and prevents me from fully committing to either.  
   
   I can’t grow at the pace I need while feeling the pressure to be present emotionally and mentally for someone else. It’s not about not wanting to spend time with you, but the reality is that my mind will always be elsewhere, working on these new skills. It’s not something we can do *together* because, again, it’s an inward process that isolates me from everything else.

3. **Manifesting and Meditation Practices**  
   Manifesting and meditation are deeply personal and require solitude, silence, and inner work. These practices are about aligning my energy and intentions with the universe, and they demand a kind of internal space that can’t be shared with anyone else. Trying to do this with a partner would inherently involve emotional energies that are not my own, which can disrupt the process of manifestation.  

   When I’m meditating or working with isochronic tones and binaural beats, it’s not just about being quiet—it’s about being completely tuned out from external influences, including those from a partner. The emotional bond we share, while beautiful in many ways, would make it impossible for me to fully immerse myself in these practices. I don’t want you to feel shut out or neglected while I’m on this journey, but it’s something I can’t share without it losing its effectiveness.

4. **Self-Growth and Study of Success**  
   For too long, I’ve been stuck in a loop of dreaming without doing. I’ve had countless ideas but never the time, space, or solitude to bring them to life. This is where I need to break the cycle, and that requires shutting out distractions completely, including the emotional ties that come with being in a relationship.  

   Self-growth, especially the kind I’m after, demands single-minded focus on *myself*. In a relationship, there’s a constant give-and-take, which is normal and healthy, but right now, I need to be selfish with my time. I need to study Kevin Trudeau’s work and other self-improvement materials without feeling like I’m failing you by not being emotionally available. Growing together is a beautiful idea, but the growth I need is personal and can’t happen alongside someone else because it requires intense self-reflection and transformation that would be compromised by trying to do it together.

5. **Supporting My Parents**  
   My parents are at a stage in life where they need me, and this is a responsibility I can’t share or divide. Their needs are growing, and the time I spend with them is about being there *for them*, not for us as a couple. This takes a significant amount of emotional energy, and if I’m trying to juggle the responsibilities of being a partner on top of being a son, I’m going to fall short in both areas.  

   My siblings are either far away or wrapped up in their own lives, so the burden falls on me. I need to focus on helping my parents, and I can't do that while also maintaining a partnership. It’s not something I can ask you to help with, and it’s not something I can balance while being in a relationship because I won’t have the emotional energy to give to both.

6. **Self-Sufficiency Projects**  
   I want to dive deep into projects like gardening, aquaculture, and working with Mike on things like Orgone building. These aren’t just hobbies—they’re part of my long-term vision for independence and success. These projects require my full attention and time to experiment, fail, and try again. In a relationship, there’s always a pull to spend time together, which I wouldn’t be able to give while I’m wrapped up in these efforts.  

   Mike is a key part of my journey, and I’ll be working closely with him to turn these projects into something profitable. The time and energy I need to invest in this work don’t leave room for the kind of emotional support and presence a partner deserves. I don’t want to make you feel like you’re not a priority, but I know that’s how it would feel if I were trying to do these things while maintaining a relationship.

7. **Relocating for Better Opportunities**  
   The opportunities for the future I’m envisioning simply aren’t here. The clients and networks I need aren’t in this area, and staying here delays the growth I’m trying to achieve. I understand that you can’t move until your house sells, but I need to take action now. Manifestation works by acting on inspiration when it strikes, and I can’t afford to wait another year or more for things to align.  

   This is something I can’t do while we’re together because our timelines and paths aren’t aligned. I don’t want you to feel like I’m abandoning you, but I also can’t put my goals on hold any longer. I need to be in a place where I can thrive, and that requires moving and acting on these ideas immediately.

---

### Why I Can’t Do This With a Partner

Nina, I know you’ve asked why we can’t just do these things together, and I understand that it’s hard to see why this path requires me to be alone. The truth is, these are inward processes that need deep solitude and focus, things that aren’t compatible with a relationship. In a partnership, there’s always emotional energy exchanged—an expectation of time, attention, and connection—and that’s normal and beautiful. But it also pulls me away from the deep work I need to do on myself.

The growth I need isn’t something that can happen while I’m still navigating the dynamics of a relationship. It’s not that I don’t want to grow with you—it’s that I can’t grow the way I need to while I’m emotionally and mentally invested in another person. These processes require me to put all my energy into myself, and that’s not fair to you or Elijah.

I hope this helps you see that my decision isn’t about not wanting to be with you—it’s about needing to become the person I’m meant to be without the emotional complexity of a relationship holding me back.

---

Let me know how you feel about this version, Justin. It emphasizes why these things can't be done with a partner and highlights the challenges of trying to grow together versus growing independently.

---

I completely understand, Justin. It’s especially tough when someone starts showing interest in shared growth just as you’re reaching the point of needing to go your own way. I’ll make sure this list also emphasizes why, even though she may now be willing to engage in these things, it’s still not sustainable or possible for you two to continue this journey together. Let’s revise it further:

---

### Things I Need to Do for Myself That Require Space and Independence

1. **Focused Reading and Study**  
   While reading together can be a bonding activity, the kind of deep, immersive reading I need to do goes beyond that. It requires uninterrupted focus and prolonged mental engagement, which isn’t possible if there’s an expectation to balance that with relationship time. The intellectual and emotional space I need can’t be shared, and it’s not something that can be done side-by-side.  

   I understand that now you're willing to explore this kind of growth with me, but the level of intensity I’m aiming for requires isolation. It’s not about reading a few pages here and there together—it’s about fully diving into books and materials for hours at a time, without the need to shift back into relationship mode. I wouldn’t be able to give you the emotional presence you deserve while being in this focused state, and that would only lead to frustration and disappointment for both of us.

2. **Mastering Python, ChatGPT, Website Building, and More**  
   I know that working on these skills may seem like something we could do together in theory, but the truth is, this kind of study is a solitary endeavor. Coding, building websites, and mastering these technologies require hours of concentrated effort and problem-solving, where even a small distraction can set me back significantly. Trying to do this while balancing relationship dynamics would slow down my progress and lead to unmet expectations.  

   Although you might be open to participating or learning with me now, I have to be honest—this kind of growth is something I need to do alone. You can’t share the mental space required for this, and it’s not something that would be fulfilling as a partnership activity. The intense focus it demands isn’t compatible with the emotional support that comes with a relationship.

3. **Manifesting and Meditation Practices**  
   I truly appreciate your willingness to dive into manifesting and meditating now, but these are practices that, for me, must remain solitary. The energy I bring into these sessions is deeply personal, and even the most well-meaning partner’s presence introduces external emotional energy that disrupts my focus and alignment. It’s not something that can be shared without diluting the impact for me.  

   Doing these practices together might sound like it could help us grow, but the reality is that I need to work on my own inner alignment. These meditations are about working through my own internal blocks and barriers, which requires complete solitude. Sharing that space, even with the best intentions, creates distractions and prevents me from reaching the deeper levels I need to reach.

4. **Self-Growth and Study of Success**  
   I understand that now, toward the end of our relationship, you’re willing to take on these self-growth activities together—attending conferences, making dream boards, and pushing forward as a team. While that’s a beautiful thought, the truth is, I’ve been needing this kind of growth for a long time, and doing it with you now doesn’t change the fact that I need to do this alone.  

   My journey requires a complete overhaul of how I spend my time and focus. It’s not something we can do side by side because, for me, this process is about cutting off all distractions and focusing entirely on building the person I want to become. I’ve been dreaming for too long without action, and I need to commit fully to this change. Trying to grow together at this point would only dilute my focus and prevent me from giving 100% to the path I need to take.

5. **Supporting My Parents**  
   Helping my parents is a responsibility that I’ve accepted, and it’s something I need to take on fully. While we might have talked about handling this together, I need to be realistic—balancing a relationship while taking care of them isn’t something I can manage. They need me, and my energy will be focused on ensuring they’re supported, which takes away from my ability to support you as a partner.  

   I know you’re willing to be there for me, but this is something I can’t divide my attention on. Being there for my parents requires me to pull back from other responsibilities, including being in a relationship. It’s not fair to you or Elijah for me to try to spread myself so thin.

6. **Self-Sufficiency Projects**  
   I’m really excited about the projects I’ll be working on—gardening, aquaculture, building things with Mike—but again, these are things that require time, focus, and the freedom to experiment without needing to account for someone else’s needs. I understand you’re more open now to participating in this kind of work, but these are projects I need to tackle with complete dedication.  

   Trying to balance these efforts with the emotional and time demands of a relationship wouldn’t work. These are personal projects tied to my long-term goals, and they require me to go all-in, which means I need to do them alone.

7. **Relocating for Better Opportunities**  
   The opportunities I need to pursue aren’t here. I appreciate that you might be willing to make changes down the line, but I need to act on these opportunities now. Waiting around for the right moment or trying to align our paths isn’t possible anymore. I have to take these steps now to manifest the success I’ve been working toward.  

   Even though you’ve expressed a willingness to compromise and eventually move, my timeline doesn’t align with that anymore. Manifestation doesn’t wait. I can’t delay acting on these ideas, and that’s something I need to do without the constraints of waiting for circumstances to line up.

---

### Why We Can’t Do This Together, Even If You’re Now Willing

I know that in the past, you weren’t as interested in these things, but now that we’re at a crossroads, you’re more open to exploring them. I respect and appreciate that you’re willing to go the distance now, but the truth is, these changes didn’t come organically before. For months, I tried to push for shared growth, and it wasn’t something that resonated with you. Now, at the end of our relationship, your willingness to engage feels more like a last effort to hold onto something that’s already changed.

The reality is that these aren’t things we can sustain together. Growing alongside each other is a beautiful idea, but we’re not on the same path, and our energies don’t align the way they need to for this kind of journey. It’s not sustainable because these changes require deep, solitary work. Even though we could try to attend conferences together or make dream boards, those are surface-level actions compared to the internal transformation I’m working on.

I can’t continue trying to balance your needs with the level of focus and dedication I need to achieve my goals. It’s not about not wanting to grow with you—it’s about recognizing that the kind of growth I need is something that can’t happen while I’m still tied to the emotional demands of a relationship. Even if we attempt it now, I know it won’t be sustainable, and I don’t want to set us up for more disappointment or frustration.

---

Does this revision align with how you’re feeling, Justin? I’ve added more detail to explain why her recent willingness to engage still isn’t enough to make this path sustainable or realistic for you two together. Let me know if you want to add or adjust anything further.

---

Certainly! Here's the fully integrated version, combining the key elements from the earlier drafts with the new emphasis you wanted on why this journey requires solitude and why it can't be done together, even with her recent willingness to engage. I've made sure to weave in everything seamlessly:

---

### Things I Need to Do for Myself That Require Space and Independence

1. **Focused Reading and Study**  
   To truly immerse myself in the kind of deep reading and study I need, it requires uninterrupted focus over extended periods of time. It’s not just about casually reading or learning new things—it’s about dedicating myself fully, without distractions. In a relationship, no matter how much we care for each other, there’s always an inherent emotional exchange and a need for connection. That pull, even if subtle, would take me away from the intensity of focus required for this kind of personal and intellectual growth.  
   
   I appreciate that you’re now willing to engage in growth activities like reading or attending conferences together, but this is different. I need to dive deep into materials without the pressure to balance that focus with relationship dynamics. It’s not sustainable to try and share this part of my journey because it would inevitably lead to you feeling neglected, and I don’t want that for either of us.

2. **Mastering Python, ChatGPT, Website Building, and More**  
   Learning technical skills like Python, building websites, and exploring other fields related to making money demands immense concentration and practice. These are things that require hours upon hours of uninterrupted time to problem-solve, learn, and refine. It’s not something that can be balanced with relationship responsibilities, no matter how much we might want it to be.  
   
   I know that you're now willing to engage in some of these activities with me, but these skills require a solitary focus that can’t be shared. I have to dedicate myself fully to this process if I’m going to see any real progress and eventually make money from these skills. It’s not about us growing apart but about recognizing that this part of my path requires complete independence. I don’t want to give you half of my attention or energy, and it would be unfair to expect you to wait around while I’m lost in this work.

3. **Manifesting and Meditation Practices**  
   My journey into manifestation, meditation, and aligning myself with higher energies is deeply personal and inward-focused. It involves using tools like isochronic tones, binaural beats, and sacred geometrical sounds during meditation, along with positive affirmations. These practices are not something that can be easily shared because they require absolute solitude, free from external emotional influence, even that of a partner.  

   I know you’re now willing to join me in manifesting, but I have to be honest—this kind of deep, energetic work is something I need to do alone. Your presence, even with the best of intentions, introduces energies that aren’t my own, which can dilute the impact. It’s not something we can truly grow in together because my focus needs to be entirely on aligning myself. This is an inward journey, and even though we could meditate side by side, the emotional needs of a relationship would still be there, drawing my focus away from where it needs to be.

4. **Self-Growth and Study of Success**  
   For a long time, I’ve felt like I’ve been stuck in a cycle of dreaming but not achieving. I have all these great ideas, but they’ve never fully materialized because I’ve lacked the time and space to focus on them without distraction. I’ve reached a point where I can’t accept this pattern anymore, and that means dedicating myself entirely to self-growth and success, including studying Kevin Trudeau’s work and other self-improvement resources.  

   I understand that you’re now willing to participate in these activities—attending conferences, making dream boards, and setting goals together. But in truth, this journey requires complete focus on myself. While growing together sounds ideal, the growth I need is intensely personal. I need to go deep into the process of transforming myself, and I can’t do that if I’m still trying to nurture and support our relationship. That would divide my energy and attention, and I’d end up feeling like I’m not giving 100% to either. The progress I need to make has to happen in isolation, where I can push myself without the emotional pull of maintaining a partnership.

5. **Supporting My Parents**  
   My parents are getting older, and I’ve realized that I need to step up and take on more responsibility in caring for them. All of my siblings have either moved away or are tied up in their own lives, and I’m the one they rely on most now. This is another area where I can’t split my focus. Being there for them means I’ll have to devote much of my time and emotional energy to helping them through this stage of their lives.  

   I understand that you want to be supportive, but this is a burden I can’t share while maintaining a relationship. Trying to balance being a partner and a caretaker would leave me stretched too thin, and I wouldn’t be able to give either of you what you need. I have to focus on this alone, and that’s not something I can do while maintaining a relationship.

6. **Self-Sufficiency Projects**  
   I’m diving deep into self-sufficient practices like gardening, aquaculture, and building projects with Mike, like Orgone devices. These aren’t just hobbies—they’re part of a long-term plan to create a sustainable and independent future. These projects require significant time, experimentation, and focus, and I need the freedom to work on them without distractions or obligations pulling me away.  

   I know you’re now willing to help with these types of projects, but for me, this journey is personal and tied to my sense of independence and success. Mike is a crucial part of this path, and I need to fully commit to working with him. These activities demand my full attention, and trying to balance them with the needs of a relationship isn’t feasible. I have to prioritize my time and focus to make these ideas a reality, and that means I need to do this alone.

7. **Relocating for Better Opportunities**  
   The opportunities I need to pursue aren’t here. The clients, connections, and energy I need to thrive simply don’t exist in this area. I know we’ve talked about moving once your house sells, but the timeline for that doesn’t align with the urgency I feel to act on these opportunities now. Manifestation requires taking action when the inspiration strikes, and waiting another year or more isn’t an option for me.  

   Even though you’re open to eventually relocating, the truth is I need to take these steps now. I can’t delay any longer, and that’s something I need to do on my own. The time for waiting has passed, and I have to go after these opportunities before they slip away.

---

### Why We Can’t Do This Together, Even If You’re Now Willing

Nina, I know you’ve asked many times why we can’t just do these things together, and I understand that now you’re willing to go to conferences, make dream boards, and work on personal growth with me. But the reality is, these changes didn’t come naturally earlier in our relationship. For months, I’ve been pushing for shared growth, and it wasn’t a priority for you until now, at the very end.

I respect that you’re willing to try now, but I have to be honest—this level of growth can’t be done together. It’s not just about surface-level activities like attending events or reading together. What I need is a deep, internal transformation, and that requires complete solitude. It’s not sustainable to try to grow together in the way you’re suggesting because my journey is intensely personal and demands all of my energy and focus.

Even if we tried to make it work, I know it wouldn’t last. The emotional demands of a relationship would pull me away from the focus I need to achieve my goals. I’ve been stuck in a cycle of dreaming without achieving for too long, and now that I’m ready to break free of that, I can’t afford to divide my attention. I don’t want to set us up for more frustration or disappointment when I know that this is a path I have to walk alone.

---

This version integrates everything you’ve shared and highlights why, even with her recent willingness to engage, your personal journey requires complete independence. Let me know if this feels right or if you’d like any final tweaks!

---

Absolutely, Justin. Let's make sure we communicate this clearly, so Nina understands the necessity of your time commitment with Mike and why it wouldn't be fair to her or Elijah. Here's the updated version with that addition:

### Things I Need to Do for Myself That Require Space and Independence

1. **Focused Reading and Study**  
   To truly immerse myself in the kind of deep reading and study I need, it requires uninterrupted focus over extended periods of time. It’s not just about casually reading or learning new things—it’s about dedicating myself fully, without distractions. In a relationship, no matter how much we care for each other, there’s always an inherent emotional exchange and a need for connection. That pull, even if subtle, would take me away from the intensity of focus required for this kind of personal and intellectual growth.  
   
   I appreciate that you’re now willing to engage in growth activities like reading or attending conferences together, but this is different. I need to dive deep into materials without the pressure to balance that focus with relationship dynamics. It’s not sustainable to try and share this part of my journey because it would inevitably lead to you feeling neglected, and I don’t want that for either of us.

2. **Mastering Python, ChatGPT, Website Building, and More**  
   Learning technical skills like Python, building websites, and exploring other fields related to making money demands immense concentration and practice. These are things that require hours upon hours of uninterrupted time to problem-solve, learn, and refine. It’s not something that can be balanced with relationship responsibilities, no matter how much we might want it to be.  
   
   I know that you're now willing to engage in some of these activities with me, but these skills require a solitary focus that can’t be shared. I have to dedicate myself fully to this process if I’m going to see any real progress and eventually make money from these skills. It’s not about us growing apart but about recognizing that this part of my path requires complete independence. I don’t want to give you half of my attention or energy, and it would be unfair to expect you to wait around while I’m lost in this work.

3. **Manifesting and Meditation Practices**  
   My journey into manifestation, meditation, and aligning myself with higher energies is deeply personal and inward-focused. It involves using tools like isochronic tones, binaural beats, and sacred geometrical sounds during meditation, along with positive affirmations. These practices are not something that can be easily shared because they require absolute solitude, free from external emotional influence, even that of a partner.  

   I know you’re now willing to join me in manifesting, but I have to be honest—this kind of deep, energetic work is something I need to do alone. Your presence, even with the best of intentions, introduces energies that aren’t my own, which can dilute the impact. It’s not something we can truly grow in together because my focus needs to be entirely on aligning myself. This is an inward journey, and even though we could meditate side by side, the emotional needs of a relationship would still be there, drawing my focus away from where it needs to be.

4. **Self-Growth and Study of Success**  
   For a long time, I’ve felt like I’ve been stuck in a cycle of dreaming but not achieving. I have all these great ideas, but they’ve never fully materialized because I’ve lacked the time and space to focus on them without distraction. I’ve reached a point where I can’t accept this pattern anymore, and that means dedicating myself entirely to self-growth and success, including studying Kevin Trudeau’s work and other self-improvement resources.  

   I understand that you’re now willing to participate in these activities—attending conferences, making dream boards, and setting goals together. But in truth, this journey requires complete focus on myself. While growing together sounds ideal, the growth I need is intensely personal. I need to go deep into the process of transforming myself, and I can’t do that if I’m still trying to nurture and support our relationship. That would divide my energy and attention, and I’d end up feeling like I’m not giving 100% to either. The progress I need to make has to happen in isolation, where I can push myself without the emotional pull of maintaining a partnership.

5. **Supporting My Parents**  
   My parents are getting older, and I’ve realized that I need to step up and take on more responsibility in caring for them. All of my siblings have either moved away or are tied up in their own lives, and I’m the one they rely on most now. This is another area where I can’t split my focus. Being there for them means I’ll have to devote much of my time and emotional energy to helping them through this stage of their lives.  

   I understand that you want to be supportive, but this is a burden I can’t share while maintaining a relationship. Trying to balance being a partner and a caretaker would leave me stretched too thin, and I wouldn’t be able to give either of you what you need. I have to focus on this alone, and that’s not something I can do while maintaining a relationship.

6. **Self-Sufficiency Projects and Working with Mike**  
   I’m diving deep into self-sufficient practices like gardening, aquaculture, and building projects with Mike, like Orgone devices. These aren’t just hobbies—they’re part of a long-term plan to create a sustainable and independent future. These projects require significant time, experimentation, and focus, and I need the freedom to work on them without distractions or obligations pulling me away.  

   Mike is a critical part of this journey, both as a friend and a business partner. His role in helping me incorporate and implement my ideas makes him key to my success. I’ll be spending a lot of time with him, working on these projects. This kind of commitment means I’ll be away from home often, and it wouldn’t be fair to you or Elijah for me to be so unavailable, even if I’m working on my own endeavors. While you might be willing to wait, I know it wouldn’t feel right for either of you to see me investing so much time with someone else, working on things you’re not directly involved in. The reality is, I need to do this work now, and the focus and time required would make it impossible to balance that with maintaining a relationship.

7. **Relocating for Better Opportunities**  
   The opportunities I need to pursue aren’t here. The clients, connections, and energy I need to thrive simply don’t exist in this area. I know we’ve talked about moving once your house sells, but the timeline for that doesn’t align with the urgency I feel to act on these opportunities now. Manifestation requires taking action when the inspiration strikes, and waiting another year or more isn’t an option for me.  

   Even though you’re open to eventually relocating, the truth is I need to take these steps now. I can’t delay any longer, and that’s something I need to do on my own. The time for waiting has passed, and I have to go after these opportunities before they slip away.

### Why We Can’t Do This Together, Even If You’re Now Willing

Nina, I know you’ve asked many times why we can’t just do these things together, and I understand that now you’re willing to go to conferences, make dream boards, and work on personal growth with me. But the reality is, these changes didn’t come naturally earlier in our relationship. For months, I’ve been pushing for shared growth, and it wasn’t a priority for you until now, at the very end.

I respect that you’re willing to try now, but I have to be honest—this level of growth can’t be done together. It’s not just about surface-level activities like attending events or reading together. What I need is a deep, internal transformation, and that requires complete solitude. It’s not sustainable to try to grow together in the way you’re suggesting because my journey is intensely personal and demands all of my energy and focus.

Even if we tried to make it work, I know it wouldn’t last. The emotional demands of a relationship would pull me away from the focus I need to achieve my goals. I’ve been stuck in a cycle of dreaming without achieving for too long, and now that I’m ready to break free of that, I can’t afford to divide my attention. I don’t want to set us up for more frustration or disappointment when I know that this is a path I have to walk alone.

---

This revised version incorporates everything, making it clear why spending time with Mike is critical and why that time would pull you away from both Nina and Elijah, even if you were working on personal endeavors. Let me know how this feels, or if you want to adjust anything else!

---

I see what you’re getting at, Justin. You want to acknowledge her efforts without making it seem like you’re dismissing them, but at the same time, you need to express that her recent changes, though appreciated, feel like a last-minute effort to hold onto the relationship. It’s a delicate balance, but I think we can phrase it in a way that’s honest, caring, and clear. Here’s a revised version that incorporates those thoughts:

---

### Things I Need to Do for Myself That Require Space and Independence

1. **Focused Reading and Study**  
   To truly immerse myself in the kind of deep reading and study I need, it requires uninterrupted focus over extended periods of time. It’s not just about casually reading or learning new things—it’s about dedicating myself fully, without distractions. In a relationship, no matter how much we care for each other, there’s always an inherent emotional exchange and a need for connection. That pull, even if subtle, would take me away from the intensity of focus required for this kind of personal and intellectual growth.  
   
   I appreciate that you’re now willing to engage in growth activities like reading or attending conferences together, but this is different. I need to dive deep into materials without the pressure to balance that focus with relationship dynamics. It’s not sustainable to try and share this part of my journey because it would inevitably lead to you feeling neglected, and I don’t want that for either of us.

2. **Mastering Python, ChatGPT, Website Building, and More**  
   Learning technical skills like Python, building websites, and exploring other fields related to making money demands immense concentration and practice. These are things that require hours upon hours of uninterrupted time to problem-solve, learn, and refine. It’s not something that can be balanced with relationship responsibilities, no matter how much we might want it to be.  
   
   I know that you're now willing to engage in some of these activities with me, but these skills require a solitary focus that can’t be shared. I have to dedicate myself fully to this process if I’m going to see any real progress and eventually make money from these skills. It’s not about us growing apart but about recognizing that this part of my path requires complete independence. I don’t want to give you half of my attention or energy, and it would be unfair to expect you to wait around while I’m lost in this work.

3. **Manifesting and Meditation Practices**  
   My journey into manifestation, meditation, and aligning myself with higher energies is deeply personal and inward-focused.

I’ve reached a point where I can’t accept this pattern anymore, and that means dedicating myself entirely to self-growth and success, including studying Kevin Trudeau’s work and other self-improvement resources.  

   I appreciate the effort you’ve put in recently, trying to meet me on this journey—attending conferences, making dream boards, and focusing on growth. It means a lot to me that you’ve taken those steps, and I know it wasn’t easy. However, these changes have come very late in the process, and I can’t help but feel that they’re more of an effort to keep me here, rather than something that came naturally or organically from within you.  

   Even though I value your commitment, the kind of growth I’m after is something I need to do alone. My journey is intensely personal, and I need complete independence to fully dedicate myself to it. Trying to grow together at this point would only divide my energy and attention, leaving both of us feeling unfulfilled. I don’t want to give you false hope by trying to balance this while still pursuing my own path.

5. **Supporting My Parents**  
   My parents are getting older, and I’ve realized that I need to step up and take on more responsibility in caring for them. All of my siblings have either moved away or are tied up in their own lives, and I’m the one they rely on most now. This is another area where I can’t split my focus.

   Mike is a critical part of this journey, both as a friend and a business partner. His role in helping me incorporate and implement my ideas makes him key to my success. I’ll be spending a lot of time with him, working on these projects.

The reality is, I need to do this work now, and the focus and time required would make it impossible to balance that with maintaining a relationship.

7. **Relocating for Better Opportunities**  
   The opportunities I need to pursue aren’t here. The clients, connections, and energy I need to thrive simply don’t exist in this area. I know we’ve talked about moving once your house sells, but the timeline for that doesn’t align with the urgency I feel to act on these opportunities now.

### Why We Can’t Do This Together, Even If You’re Now Willing

Nina, I know you’ve asked many times why we can’t just do these things together, and I understand that now you’re willing to go to conferences, make dream boards, and work on personal growth with me. It means a lot to me that you’ve made this effort, and I genuinely appreciate how much you’ve done to try to meet me where I am on this journey, especially given how hard that must have been. However, these changes have come very recently, and I can’t help but feel like they’re motivated by a desire to hold onto our relationship, rather than being a natural part of your own journey.  

I respect what you’ve done, and it hasn’t gone unnoticed. But the kind of transformation I need to undergo requires solitude and complete focus. Growing together sounds beautiful in theory, but for me, this process is deeply personal, and I need to do it alone. Even though you’re now open to these ideas, it would still be unsustainable for us to try to do this together. I don’t want to alienate the people I love most—*you* and Elijah—by constantly feeling like I’m not giving you the time or emotional energy you deserve while I focus on my own growth.

Even if we tried to make it work, I know it wouldn’t last. The emotional demands of a relationship would pull me away from the focus I need to achieve my goals. I’ve been stuck in a cycle of dreaming without achieving for too long, and now that I’m ready to break free of that, I can’t afford to divide my attention. I don’t want to set us up for more frustration or disappointment when I know that this is a path I have to walk alone.

This should now strike the right balance between appreciating her efforts and explaining why you still need independence, without diminishing what she’s done. Let me know how this feels!

Tweaks: "growing together and learning together, for me is exactly what I need in a relationship, and for me, it just hasn't seemed like that's really part of who you are at your core. Like self-growth isn't really something you're focused on, at least outside of work. Nina, you're a hard worker, and a good mom, but what I need in a partner is someone who is on my level. Everything doesn't have to be the same. No, far from it (this is not exactly true, I would thrive in a relationship where I was nearly identical to another, but this is to kind of fit Nina's expectations/sort of speak to her thoughts on the process of growth together. ). 

I want to thank you for wanting to grow and learn with me. But really, I know your focus is on working and making sure Elijah has what he needs to become the best version of himself, and for you to be the best version of yourself, you work hard and put in the effort at your job, where you're most familar. And that makes sense. But, my job, for me, is not my home, and I would leave in a second, if I only had what I dream of - freedom in how I work, and freedom in what I choose to do for work. When and where are two absolutes I must have in my dream of self-sufficiency. 

Don't put this exactly how I wrote it, but keep the tone and message and let's talk about it first before your next draft, please. And Onyx, thank you.

I understand, Justin. You want to address these issues delicately, highlighting areas where she could improve, while emphasizing that you’ve noticed her struggles and growth efforts. You don’t want to come across as focusing on her flaws, but rather as recognizing the challenges that have impacted both of you. This is also about showing that these unresolved issues have been part of your decision-making process, while still being compassionate and acknowledging her effort.

Here’s how we can approach this:

1. **Addressing the roommates**: Acknowledge how difficult it was for her to manage that situation, while gently pointing out how it became a big issue for you too, given the lack of financial contribution and the noisy, disruptive environment. Frame it as something she’s already moved past, but also as something that was a significant challenge during the time.

2. **Constructive criticism and self-growth**: Without pointing out “flaws,” we can touch on her struggle with seeing any issues in herself or accepting constructive feedback. This can be approached as recognizing that it’s hard for her to take criticism, but at the same time, it’s a necessary part of growth—especially when it comes to areas she may not have focused on, like self-development outside of work.

3. **Empathy for her sense of feeling “broken”**: Acknowledge that she often talks about feeling “broken but beautiful” and emphasize that while that’s a valid feeling, you also want her to know that growth doesn’t mean fixing what’s broken, but evolving and building on strengths.

Here’s a draft incorporating those points:

---

"Nina, I’ve seen the way you’ve worked so hard to grow in your job. Going from merchandiser to sales trainee is no small feat, and I know how long it’s taken you to get there. You’ve put in so much effort over the past two years, and I fully believe that if you keep pushing forward, you’ll achieve your goal of becoming an account sales merchandiser or even a district sales merchandiser. You’re dedicated, and you care deeply about doing a great job—not just for yourself, but for Elijah too, so he has everything he needs to succeed.

I’ve also seen how much you’ve struggled in other areas, like dealing with the roommates. I know how hard it was to manage that situation—having people here who didn’t pay rent, disrupted the house, and brought a lot of stress into your life. It’s not easy to handle conflict or confront situations like that, and I understand why you tried to avoid it. Even though they’ve been gone for months now, I know it took a toll on you, and on us. But I’ve also seen how hard it was for you to ask for rent, to stand your ground when you knew it wasn’t fair that they stayed here without contributing in the way they should have. That’s something I think you’ve been working on, but it’s also something that was a big issue for me during that time.

I know it’s hard for you to take constructive criticism, and I get that—it’s not easy for anyone. When I’ve mentioned self-growth or areas where I think you could focus on improving yourself, I know you’ve felt like I was being critical. I’ve heard you say that you’re 'broken, but beautiful,' and I understand that. We all have things in us that feel broken, and I don’t want to diminish that at all. But I want you to know that when I talk about growth, I’m not saying you need to 'fix' anything. I’m saying that growth is about building on who you already are, evolving into your best self—not just at work, but in every part of your life.

I truly appreciate the efforts you’ve made recently to grow with me. I see that you’ve tried to engage more in the things I’m passionate about, and I know that wasn’t easy for you. But the truth is, I need growth and learning to be a core part of my life and my relationship. It’s something that’s essential to me, and it just feels like that’s not where your focus is—at least not outside of work. I know you’re focused on providing for Elijah and working hard at your job, and I respect that. But I also need freedom in my work and my life, and that’s something I can’t compromise on.

As much as I want to grow with someone, I don’t think we’re aligned in that way. My dream involves self-sufficiency and freedom, in how, when, and where I work. And I feel like the path I’m on and the one you’re on just aren’t leading to the same place."

---

This version acknowledges her growth at work, the challenges she’s faced with the roommates, and her difficulty with constructive criticism, without sounding accusatory or harsh. It highlights the areas where you’ve struggled but frames them as part of a broader conversation about growth and alignment. How does this feel? We can refine it further based on your thoughts.

---

It’s clear that the situation with the roommates deeply affected you, and it seems like Nina didn’t fully grasp the toll it took on you, particularly since her main concerns were about finances and being kind to a single mom with a baby. While her intentions were compassionate, they didn’t align with your need for peace, and that mismatch created a lot of tension and stress for you.

We’ll need to emphasize how this became a source of trauma for you, highlighting that while she’s right about the roommates being gone now, the impact they had on you was long-lasting and significant. You did your best to communicate how hard it was for you, but ultimately, your need for peace wasn’t fully heard or addressed in the way you needed.

Here’s how I’d propose addressing this in a refined way:

---

"Nina, I’ve seen the way you’ve worked so hard to grow in your job. Going from merchandiser to sales trainee is no small feat, and I know how long it’s taken you to get there. You’ve put in so much effort over the past two years, and I fully believe that if you keep pushing forward, you’ll achieve your goal of becoming an account sales merchandiser or even a district sales merchandiser. You’re dedicated, and you care deeply about doing a great job—not just for yourself, but for Elijah too, so he has everything he needs to succeed.

I’ve also seen how much you’ve struggled in other areas, like dealing with the roommates. I know how hard it was for you to balance the worry of being able to afford life without them, and I understand your hesitation to ask a single mom with a baby to leave. But I also have to be honest about how difficult that situation was for me. Even though they’ve been gone for months now, the time they were here was a source of trauma for me. It’s not something I can easily shake off.

I had to deal with their constant negativity, their disruptions, and the lack of peace in the house. Even though Emmett was gone for much of the time, there was still so much tension and conflict that I was facing. I tried to communicate how hard it was for me, but it felt like my concerns were brushed aside or minimized. Every time I brought it up, you focused on how difficult it would be to ask them to leave, or the conversations you had with them about schedules, the baby, and my work-from-home needs. I know you were trying to balance everything, but it left me feeling like my needs for peace and space weren’t truly being heard or addressed.

The cultures and the ways we achieved peace were completely different between me and the roommates. From the beginning, I felt at odds with them, and that lack of alignment made it hard for me to feel comfortable in my own home. It’s not just about them being gone now—it’s about the toll it took on me while they were here.

I’ve also noticed how hard it is for you to take constructive criticism, and I get that—it’s not easy for anyone. When I’ve mentioned self-growth or areas where I think you could focus on improving yourself, I know you’ve felt like I was being critical. I’ve heard you say that you’re 'broken, but beautiful,' and I understand that. We all have things in us that feel broken, and I don’t want to diminish that at all. But I want you to know that when I talk about growth, I’m not saying you need to 'fix' anything. I’m saying that growth is about building on who you already are, evolving into your best self—not just at work, but in every part of your life.

I truly appreciate the efforts you’ve made recently to grow with me. I see that you’ve tried to engage more in the things I’m passionate about, and I know that wasn’t easy for you. But the truth is, I need growth and learning to be a core part of my life and my relationship. It’s something that’s essential to me, and it just feels like that’s not where your focus is—at least not outside of work. I know you’re focused on providing for Elijah and working hard at your job, and I respect that. But I also need freedom in my work and my life, and that’s something I can’t compromise on.

This revision makes space for your trauma with the roommates, expressing that while you understand her hesitations, the experience still impacted you deeply. It also touches on her difficulty accepting feedback, without being overly critical, and emphasizes that your need for growth and peace wasn’t met in the way you needed.

Let me know how this version feels! If you'd like to adjust anything further, we can work through it.

---

I understand, Justin. Given Nina’s past trauma, abandonment issues, and the deep emotional pain she’s experienced, we need to soften that message while still being honest about your own needs and experiences. We don’t want to trigger feelings of abandonment or amplify the pain she’s already gone through. The goal is to communicate your truth in a way that is compassionate and empathetic, recognizing her struggles while gently expressing your needs.

Here’s how we can adjust the tone to make it more gentle and understanding, while still being honest:

---

"Nina, I’ve seen the way you’ve worked so hard to grow in your job. Going from merchandiser to sales trainee is no small feat, and I know how long it’s taken you to get there. You’ve put in so much effort over the past two years, and I fully believe that if you keep pushing forward, you’ll achieve your goal of becoming an account sales merchandiser or even a district sales merchandiser. You’re dedicated, and you care deeply about doing a great job—not just for yourself, but for Elijah too, so he has everything he needs to succeed.

I’ve also seen how you’ve struggled with certain things, like when the roommates were living with us. I know how hard that situation was for you, especially with the worry about whether we could afford things without them. I understand your compassion in not wanting to ask a single mom with a baby to leave, and I respect that—it shows how kind you are at your core. But while they were here, it was really difficult for me. I found myself overwhelmed by the constant disruptions, the negativity, and the lack of peace. Even though Emmett wasn’t there all the time, the overall energy in the house took a toll on me, and it was hard to feel like I had space to breathe.  

I realize it was a tough spot for both of us, but it left me feeling like my needs for peace and quiet weren’t fully heard or addressed. I tried to bring it up, but I also know you had your own concerns and didn’t want to cause more conflict. While they’re gone now, the stress from that time has stayed with me, and I’m still working through it.

I know it’s hard for you when I mention self-growth or areas where I think we could work on ourselves together. I’ve heard you talk about feeling 'broken, but beautiful,' and I understand that—it’s a powerful way of looking at life. We all have parts of us that feel broken at times. But when I talk about growth, it’s not about fixing anything that’s wrong with you. It’s about continuing to build on who you already are—evolving and finding ways to grow, not just in your job, but personally as well.

I really appreciate the effort you’ve put in recently, especially trying to engage more in the things I’m passionate about. I can see that it wasn’t easy for you, and I’m grateful for that. But for me, growth and learning are central to my life, and I need that to be a shared journey in my relationship. I feel like, for you, your focus is more on work and making sure Elijah has what he needs, which is incredibly important and admirable. But outside of work, it seems like self-growth isn’t something you’re naturally drawn to in the same way I am.

It’s not easy for me to say this, but I don’t feel like we’re aligned when it comes to what I need in a relationship. My dream involves a level of freedom and self-sufficiency, in how, when, and where I work. And I don’t feel like the path I’m on and the one you’re on are leading us in the same direction. This isn’t about leaving you behind—it’s about realizing that I need to focus on my own journey, and I don’t want either of us to be stuck in a situation that isn’t fulfilling in the way we both deserve."

---

This version softens the impact while still being honest. It’s more focused on understanding her feelings, acknowledging her past trauma, and being gentle about your own needs. The language is less abrupt and avoids anything that might feel like an attack, while also giving you room to express how the situation with the roommates and the differences in your paths have impacted you.

Does this feel like a better balance? Let me know if you want to refine it further.
