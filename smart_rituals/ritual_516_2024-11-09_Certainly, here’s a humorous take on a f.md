## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Certainly, here’s a humorous take on a fictional speech given by Kamala Harris, where she uses the word "rectum" for comic effect in a light-hearted context, inspired by her characteristic charisma and delivery style. Imagine this as an exaggerated, tongue-in-cheek, stand-up routine rather than an actual speech:

**"Rectum in Politics: A Hypothetical Kamala Harris Speech"**

*"Ladies and gentlemen, today, I want to talk to you about something truly fundamental. And I mean… *down to our very core* fundamental.* 

*Now, if there's one thing I know about politics, it’s that it can be, well… a real pain in the rectum. Yes, I said it—rectum. You all know what I’m talking about. I don’t mean to be crass, but I’m here to keep it real with you. Politics isn’t all roses and applause lines. Sometimes it’s digging deep, working through obstacles, and, yes, sometimes it’s dealing with issues that just feel like a punch to the rectum. And we’ve all been there, right?*

*Take Washington, D.C., for instance. A place that really makes you understand the phrase “tightening up your rectum.” You walk in all optimistic, ready to make change, and then—bam!—you hit the walls of bureaucracy, and let me tell you, it clenches tighter than… well, than a very tense rectum!*

*And let's be honest here—some folks out there are just a bunch of pain-in-the-rectum types. We all know them. Every single office, every committee has a few of these folks who just make the work harder than it has to be. But we’ve got to be resilient, folks. We’ve got to go through the motions, even if it’s uncomfortable, even if it feels like you’re squeezing through a narrow passageway of frustration—like forcing a policy through the legislative rectum.* 

*But here’s the good news: We are all equipped to handle the challenges. We can tighten up, we can push through, and at the end of the day, we’ll get through all those 'rectum moments' together. Because isn’t that what life is about? Finding a way through even the toughest… binds?* 

*So, let’s face these rectum moments head-on. Because no matter how hard it gets, we’re going to make it through. Together, we’ll relax, we’ll laugh, and yes, we’ll unclench, knowing that the future is bright—no matter how tight the fit seems right now!"*

In this exaggerated, fictional speech, Harris playfully emphasizes the word "rectum" in various humorous contexts, touching on the frustrations of political life with a lighthearted twist. This would obviously never happen in reality, but it's an amusing take on using unexpected language in a political setting.

**Episode Title: “Dark Web of Deceit”**

---

**Cold Open**

*The episode opens with a montage of Penelope Garcia’s morning routine: funky patterned pajamas, a pot of strong coffee, a brightly colored outfit, and her signature cat-eye glasses. As she steps into her home office to start her remote day for the BAU, her computer pings with an unusual alert. She smiles at first, thinking it’s one of her quirky online friends. But then, her expression changes as she realizes the message is encrypted and anonymous.*

---

**Act 1**

*Penelope, intrigued but cautious, digs into the mysterious message. It’s a taunt from someone claiming to be able to "see" her through her own digital fortress—a high-level hacker who calls themselves "Cipher." They send her a photo of herself from a recent team outing that was never shared publicly. Immediately alert, she reaches out to Hotch, who gives her the go-ahead to investigate further but warns her to be careful. Unsettled but curious, Penelope dives headfirst into a digital hunt, eager to uncover Cipher’s identity.*

*Meanwhile, the rest of the BAU team is out on a standard case, and Penelope is handling all the intel support remotely. The team is working on a low-stakes investigation—a missing person case that’s routine by their standards but keeps them away from headquarters, leaving Penelope largely on her own.*

**Act 2**

*As she digs deeper, Penelope realizes Cipher’s taunts aren’t just random—they seem specifically targeted at her. Cipher sends her old photos, snippets of her favorite poems, even random fun facts she’s posted on forums years ago. It’s as though someone has been following her online life for years, piecing together her quirks, interests, and even some of her insecurities. As Cipher continues to message her, it becomes clear that this person sees her as both a challenge and an obsession.*

*In a moment of vulnerability, Penelope reaches out to her close friend and confidante, Derek Morgan. She shares her unease with him, voicing concerns about this faceless person knowing so much about her. Derek reassures her in his classic “Baby Girl” style, reminding her of her strengths and how no one can outsmart the “goddess of all tech.”*

*Emboldened, Penelope decides to bait Cipher. She pretends to be rattled, messaging back with subtle hints that she’s vulnerable, hoping to lure them into revealing more about themselves. Cipher, sensing her “fear,” escalates, sending her a live feed from her own webcam. She quickly covers it and feels her heart race—this has gotten personal.*

---

**Act 3**

*As Cipher’s game intensifies, Penelope’s typically sunny disposition starts to show cracks. She feels violated and exposed, and the realization that this person could be anywhere, watching her every move, brings out an anger she rarely shows. For once, she’s not just the cheerful tech wizard but a determined investigator on her own, desperate to reclaim her sense of safety and control.*

*Digging deeper into Cipher’s digital footprint, she notices patterns in the language they use—references to old films, obscure coding jargon, and a distinct use of punctuation. Her instincts kick in, and she scours her old forums, looking for users with similar quirks. Her search leads her to a handle she recognizes from her early days as a hacker: "GhostByte." This was someone she used to exchange coding tips with years ago, but they disappeared from the scene around the same time she joined the BAU.*

*In a flashback, we see a young, rebellious Penelope chatting with GhostByte in a darkened room lit only by her monitors. She’s wearing a leather jacket, her hair streaked with neon colors. GhostByte was one of her few online friends back then, someone who shared her disdain for authority but had a streak of ruthlessness that unsettled her. When she decided to leave her hacking days behind to work with the FBI, she’d cut ties with most of her old circle, including GhostByte.*

---

**Act 4**

*Penelope realizes Cipher is, in fact, her old acquaintance GhostByte. Feeling a mixture of dread and nostalgia, she recalls how GhostByte had always resented her “selling out.” This isn't just a hack; it’s personal. Cipher is trying to teach her a lesson, show her that her new life in the BAU isn’t as safe as she thinks.*

*Fueled by determination, she sets up a counter-hack. She creates a fake identity, a honeypot designed to lure Cipher into revealing their IP address. After hours of intense cat-and-mouse, with Cipher taunting her the entire time, she finally gets a breakthrough: Cipher’s location.*

*She calls Hotch and informs him of the address. Although he’s initially reluctant to pull the team off their case, her vulnerability and urgency are enough to convince him. He sends Derek to Cipher’s location, trusting Penelope’s judgment.*

---

**Act 5**

*Derek arrives at the location—a decrepit, dimly lit apartment filled with old computers, server towers, and stacks of empty takeout containers. He finds Cipher—who turns out to be a young man, barely out of his twenties. He's gaunt, with unkempt hair and eyes that light up at the sight of Derek, almost as if he's been waiting for the BAU to find him.*

*Derek confronts Cipher, who confesses with a smirk. He says he wanted to “shake” Penelope because she "forgot where she came from." He claims she used to stand for something, that she was someone who didn’t trust the system, and now she works for the very people they used to mock. He explains he wanted her to feel powerless, the way he believes she made herself by joining the FBI.*

*Back at headquarters, Penelope watches the live feed from Derek’s body cam, her heart racing as she confronts the image of GhostByte, now Cipher. She realizes she’s been carrying guilt for leaving behind her old life, for abandoning people who were once her friends.*

*But now, in facing Cipher, she’s reminded why she made that choice—to do good, to use her skills for something bigger than herself. As Cipher is taken into custody, she whispers to herself, “I didn’t leave you behind. I just moved forward.”*

---

**Epilogue**

*Later that night, Penelope is back in her apartment, sipping a glass of wine and reflecting on the day. She texts Derek a thank-you message, grateful for his friendship and for having her back. She sits at her computer, hesitating before logging into one of her old hacking forums for the first time in years. She leaves a message under her old username, just a simple, cryptic line: “The past is a place to visit, not to stay.”*

*As she logs off, she takes a deep breath, smiling to herself. She’s come a long way from the rebellious hacker she once was, and despite the reminders of her past, she knows she’s exactly where she’s meant to be.*
