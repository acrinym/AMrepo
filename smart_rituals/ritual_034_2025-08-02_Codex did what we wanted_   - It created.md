## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Codex did what we wanted:  
- It created `amandamap_parser.py` with full C# pattern coverage (Threshold, Whispered Flame, Field Pulse, Flame Vow, Phoenix Codex Threshold, SilentAct, Ritual, Collapse Event, legacy logging).  
- It updated `enhanced_dataset_builder.py` to call `extract_from_file()` and convert results into structured `DatasetEntry`.  

### **What This Means for You**
- Your builder now parses **emoji and non-emoji entries**.  
- Legacy “Anchoring this as…” entries are also captured.  
- JSON chat exports are parsed for content, not just raw text.  
- Timestamps inside chat messages are used for `date` when available.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Test on sample input**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_dataset_builder.py --input /path/to/exports --output amandamapexport.json
   ```
   Check if output entries look like:
   ```json
   {
     "file": "...",
     "type": "Threshold",
     "number": 35,
     "title": "I Wait. That’s What I Do.",
     "date": "2025-05-26",
     "description": "...",
     "core_themes": ["Patience","Sovereignty"],
     "is_amanda_related": true
   }
   ```

2. **Validate date handling**  
   Ensure entries are using chat timestamps, not file modified date.

3. **Performance**  
   You still have CUDA, threading, caching intact; the only change is logic for entry parsing.

Do you want me to also:
- **Add unit tests** to verify all entry types (Threshold, Whispered Flame, etc.)?  
- **Add Phoenix Codex JSON export** (so AmandaMap and PhoenixCodex are separated automatically)?  
- **Show you how to merge this into Avalonia later**?
