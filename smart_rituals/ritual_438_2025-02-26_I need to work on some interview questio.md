### **Interview Script for Peckham Story**  

#### **1. Your background, as much or as little as you’d like to share.**  
Hi, my name is Justin, and I’m a Technical Support Representative working on the USDA contract through Peckham. I’m based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and I’ve been in this role since 2017. My journey into tech support wasn’t necessarily a straight line—I’ve always been fascinated by computers, problem-solving, and helping people, and this job has given me the opportunity to do all three. Outside of work, I have a passion for alternative energy, history, and music production, and I enjoy diving deep into learning new things.  

#### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**  
I first heard about Peckham while looking for job opportunities that aligned with my tech skills and desire for remote work. The mission of Peckham and its inclusive work environment stood out to me, and I saw it as a great opportunity to develop my career while being part of something meaningful.  

#### **3. When did you start working at Peckham?**  
I started working at Peckham in 2017, and it’s been an incredible journey since then. Over the years, I’ve grown both professionally and personally, gaining valuable skills and forming great connections with my colleagues.  

#### **4. What do you enjoy most about working on the USDA contract?**  
One of the things I enjoy most about working on the USDA contract is the variety of challenges that come with supporting end-users. Every day is different, and I get to problem-solve while helping people across the country. It’s fulfilling to know that my work directly supports a federal agency that plays a key role in agriculture, food safety, and conservation.  

#### **5. What do you enjoy most about working at Peckham?**  
Peckham has a unique culture that genuinely values its employees. The supportive work environment, the opportunities for professional growth, and the sense of community make it a great place to work. I appreciate how Peckham invests in its employees and provides a space where people from different backgrounds can thrive.  

#### **6. What experiences have you had that align with Peckham’s mission (or vice versa)?**  
Peckham’s mission focuses on creating opportunities for individuals to succeed regardless of their background or challenges, and that resonates with me on a personal level. Life doesn’t always follow a straight path, and I’ve faced my own obstacles along the way. The idea that people can develop their skills, gain confidence, and build careers in a supportive environment is something I fully believe in.  

#### **7. Talk about any barriers you’ve overcome in your personal or professional life.**  
Like many people, I’ve faced challenges—whether it’s navigating career uncertainty, dealing with personal struggles, or overcoming obstacles to self-growth. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that perseverance and adaptability are key. Working at Peckham has given me the stability to build on my skills and continue growing in my career while also pursuing my personal interests.  

#### **8. Is there anything you’d like to say to people at the USDA watching this video?**  
I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to support the important work you do. It’s easy to forget that behind every technical issue is a person who’s working hard to make a difference, and I take pride in being able to help in any way I can.  

#### **9. What impact has Peckham had on you, and what impact have you had on Peckham?**  
Peckham has provided me with stability, growth, and a work environment where I feel valued. In return, I believe I’ve brought dedication, problem-solving skills, and a strong work ethic to my role. It’s a mutual relationship where I continue to learn and contribute, and I appreciate the opportunity to be part of the team.  

#### **10. What do you enjoy doing outside of work?**  
Outside of work, I have a lot of interests! I enjoy working on music production, researching alternative energy and suppressed history, and practicing fire spinning. I’m also into alternative health and enjoy learning about natural remedies and energy work. Staying creative and continuously learning is something that keeps me motivated and engaged.  

#### **11. Anything else you’d like to talk about.**  
I’d just like to say that Peckham is a great place to work, and I’m grateful for the experiences I’ve had here. If anyone out there is looking for an opportunity to grow and be part of a supportive team, I’d highly recommend it.

Would you like me to refine anything or adjust the tone further?

Well, this isn't just any generic interview though, this is my chance to answer "how has Peckham impacted you". I've been asking for this since I got here back in 2017. 

I found out about Peckham in 2016 during a failing marriage, and applied to a tech support position that promised free, paid training. Well, that it was. 
First it was the Goodwill Training for the CompTIA A+ 101/102.(I think that's what it was in 2016, correct it if it's wrong), where I met a lot of incredible people, including Chet Brown(the instructor) and Brian, almost like a guidance counselor - at least, to me. 

A while later, after doing my federally mandated background check, etc, I had an interview and was placed in training. It lasted,, I think 4 weeks. 

This entire time, working for Peckham - I've utilized my colleagues, and structured assistance platforms (VSS(Vocational Support Specialist), Training, Mentoring, Cross-training, talking with management at all levels of our contract and every supervisor at least once, and getting to know everyone I can in the office when I work there. 

But the reason I adore Peckham so much, is this place has literally saved my life - and taught me how to interact with the human population of adults. 
I have Asperger's, what is now commonly referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorder, or High-Functioning Autism(Correct if wrong), and I always hated talking to people before now. 

After 9 years of talking on the phone and chatting with people, I've learned how to interact with others, how to make real friends, what it's like to be "the odd one out"(because I have some quirky interests), and what it's like meeting someone through Peckham - how it feels to be in love with someone from work (not current, but it has happened). 

The thing that sets Peckham apart is they hire people with disabilities, and one of the Company's main points is rehabilitation - and that's the part that really is on point, for me anyway. Rehabilitating me from "just some autistic adult kid who has no idea how to adult or communicate" to a very professional communicator who highly enjoys communicating, more than many people with autism and everything that comes along with it. 
Peckham, as I mentioned before, taught me how to think like a professional, and how to Adult, and how to ask for help. I never had these resources before, and this is the place where I retreat to when I really can't stand the outside world, AKA real-life. 
We have spaces to hang out here, work out, places to food, read, retreat to, meeting rooms (which can be time-slotted if necessary) and lots of "hutts" which are little rooms with chairs, desks, and doors, which can be used for getting away, working ( if equipment / supervisor allows), lunch, hanging out, or meetings. Pretty much an all inclusive get away spot. 

I found out about Peckham - 
Thu, Jul 16, 2015 - 

This was my email to the program manager for Goodwill's certification program. 

Hello,
My name is Justin Gargano.
I found your ad on Craigslist about Entry-level IT work, striking to me
because I have always wanted an IT job. I've got a LOT of self-taught
computer skills, and am comfortable with talking on the phone.

I've been diagnosed with Asperger's(unofficially), Bipolar, ADD, and
ADHD by Dr Wayne Silver, of Pine Rest, at North Ottawa Community
Hospital several years ago. I have had much difficulty finding work that
I could keep in a factory or industrial setting. My ex-brother in law
has been nice enough to provide me with contract work since October
2013, however, as of late, it has become increasingly difficult to work
in this environment. Currently, I work in a warehouse doing data entry,
inventory management, and warehouse management, by myself.

A position like this would be a dream come true.

Thank you very much for your time, and I appreciate you reading this.

Cordially,

                  Justin Gargano.

That's when I got introduced to the training program thorugh Goodwill, to get my A+ Certification. It was several days later when I got a response, but in December I started Training in Group #22! 
I was working and And A+ Certified by next year. A lot of time in between, but I had to get a clearance, get documentation, interview, do the Exam taking, training class for my A+, the training class for Peckham.... etc.

## **Interview Responses - Justin Gargano**  

### **1. Your background, as much or as little as you’d like to share.**  
My name is Justin Gargano, and I’ve been working at Peckham since 2017 as a Technical Support Representative on the USDA contract. But my journey here started long before that. Back in 2015, I was struggling in a failing marriage, bouncing between contract work in a warehouse, and searching for something more—something stable, something meaningful.  

That’s when I found an ad on Craigslist about an entry-level IT training program through Goodwill, offering free, paid training to get A+ certified. It felt like a **dream come true**. I had always been self-taught in computers, but I never had the credentials to break into the industry.  

At the time, I wasn’t just looking for a job—I was looking for a **lifeline**. Something that would help me escape the cycle I was in and give me a **real chance** at a career. That’s what led me to Peckham.  

### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**  
It all started with that **Craigslist ad** in July 2015. I reached out to Goodwill’s IT training program, explaining that I had been unofficially diagnosed with **Asperger’s (now called Autism Spectrum Disorder)**, **Bipolar Disorder**, **ADD**, and **ADHD**, and that I had struggled to keep jobs in factory or industrial settings.  

I got a response a few days later, and by **December 2015**, I was officially in **Group #22** of the **CompTIA A+ training program**. That’s where I met incredible people like **Chet Brown** (the instructor) and **Brian**, who felt almost like a guidance counselor to me.  

After completing the program, I went through a federally mandated background check, interviews, and more training before I finally started working at Peckham in **2017**. It was a long road, but it was worth every step.  

### **3. When did you start working at Peckham?**  
I officially started working at Peckham in **2017**, after completing my A+ certification and going through all the necessary clearances. From there, I entered a four-week training program before joining the USDA contract.  

### **4. What do you enjoy most about working on the USDA contract?**  
What I love most is the **problem-solving** aspect—helping people, figuring things out, and making sure USDA employees can do their jobs without tech getting in the way. Every day presents a new challenge, and I enjoy being that person who can provide solutions.  

Beyond that, working with the **USDA** means supporting an agency that plays a critical role in agriculture, food safety, and conservation. It feels good to know that my work contributes to something bigger.  

### **5. What do you enjoy most about working at Peckham?**  
Peckham isn’t just a workplace—it’s a **community**. The thing that sets Peckham apart is that it **hires people with disabilities** and focuses on **rehabilitation**—not just physically, but socially and professionally.  

For me, Peckham has been **life-changing**. It has given me:  
- A structured environment where I could **learn and grow**.  
- Colleagues, mentors, and managers who **genuinely care**.  
- The **tools to develop real social and professional skills**.  

### **6. What experiences have you had that align with Peckham’s mission (or vice versa)?**  
Peckham’s mission is about **empowering individuals and creating opportunities**—and that mission is **deeply personal** to me.  

When I first started, I wasn’t just an entry-level IT worker—I was someone who **struggled with communication, social interaction, and feeling like I belonged**. I have **high-functioning autism**, and before working here, I **hated talking to people**.  

But Peckham changed that. Over the last 9 years, I’ve:  
- Learned how to **communicate professionally and confidently**.  
- Built **real friendships**.  
- Learned how to **ask for help and collaborate**.  
- Gone from feeling like the **“odd one out”** to someone who thrives in human interaction.  

Peckham didn’t just give me a job—it **taught me how to be an adult**.  

### **7. Talk about any barriers you’ve overcome in your personal or professional life.**  
Before Peckham, I struggled with:  
- **Keeping a stable job** because of my disabilities.  
- **Feeling isolated** due to my difficulty with social interaction.  
- **Not knowing how to navigate adult responsibilities**.  

Peckham helped me **overcome all of that**.  

Now, I’m a **professional communicator**, something I never thought I’d say about myself. I **love talking to people**, learning about them, and engaging in meaningful conversations—something that many people with autism struggle with.  

### **8. Is there anything you’d like to say to people at the USDA watching this video?**  
Yes—thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to support the important work you do. Every day, my goal is to **make your job easier** by ensuring your tech works smoothly. It’s an honor to be part of the support team that keeps everything running behind the scenes.  

### **9. What impact has Peckham had on you, and what impact have you had on Peckham?**  
Peckham has **fundamentally changed me**. It took someone who struggled with communication and social interaction and turned me into a **confident, professional, and skilled** worker.  

As for my impact on Peckham, I’d like to think I’ve contributed by:  
- **Helping my colleagues** through mentoring, cross-training, and collaborating.  
- **Utilizing every available resource** (VSS, training, management discussions) to **grow and improve**—and encouraging others to do the same.  
- **Building relationships with nearly everyone** in the office, creating a stronger sense of community.  

### **10. What do you enjoy doing outside of work?**  
I have a ton of interests! Outside of work, I:  
- **Produce music**—I love creating and experimenting with different sounds.  
- **Research alternative history and free energy**—I’m fascinated by suppressed knowledge.  
- **Practice fire spinning**—yes, actual fire spinning!  
- **Explore natural healing and alternative medicine**.  

I like to keep my mind engaged and continuously learn new things.  

### **11. Anything else you’d like to talk about?**  
If there’s one thing I want to say, it’s this:  

Peckham isn’t just a company—it’s **a second chance**. It’s a place where people who might have struggled elsewhere get the opportunity to **learn, grow, and succeed**.  

For me, it was a **life-changer**. It **saved me** when I was at a low point, and it **transformed me** into the person I am today.  

And for that, I’ll always be grateful.

Peckham gave me that drive, the drive to succeed, the motivation to actually continue sometimes(Peckham has been my safe place - for years - and has literally saved my life before).

### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**  
*(Already covered—moving to the next.)*  

### **3. When did you start working at Peckham?**  
I officially started working at Peckham in **July 2016** after completing the A+ training program through Goodwill. The process took time, from training and certification to the background check and job placement, but when I finally joined Peckham, I knew I had found something different—something that wasn’t just another job but a place where I could grow and **truly belong**.  

### **4. What do you enjoy most about working on the USDA contract?**  
What I enjoy most about the USDA contract is the **direct impact we have** on people’s ability to do their jobs.

It’s more than just answering calls or fixing issues—it’s about being a **reliable point of contact** for people who are working hard to support agriculture, food safety, and conservation across the country.  

The USDA contract has also given me the chance to **grow professionally**—it’s challenged me to improve my communication, technical skills, and ability to work with a wide variety of people.

### **6. What experiences have you had that align with Peckham’s mission (or vice versa)?**  
Peckham’s mission is **deeply personal** to me. I was once the autistic, ADD kid who had no idea how to communicate in the real world. Peckham didn’t just **enable** me to have real-world experiences—it **forced** me to step out of my comfort zone.  

- **For me, discomfort = growth.** Every uncomfortable situation reinforced my learning, making me stronger and more adaptable.  
- **I learned how to communicate.** I went from someone who **hated talking to people** to someone who **thrives on connection and conversation**.

- **Depression?** This place is my escape from that. Peckham is where I go when I **need stability**—it’s been my **safe haven** for years.  

### **8. Is there anything you’d like to say to people at the USDA watching this video?**  
Just—**thank you.**  

You may not get to meet all of us Peckhamites, but you’ve made an **incredible** impact on our lives—professionally, in terms of career growth, and even outside of work. This opportunity has given me **stability, purpose, and the ability to grow into the best version of myself**.  

### **9. What impact has Peckham had on you, and what impact have you had on Peckham?**  
Peckham **gave me drive**—the drive to **succeed**, to **keep going even when it was hard**, and to **build something bigger than myself**. It has literally **saved my life before**.  

My impact on Peckham?  
- I helped **conceive and develop the Internal Help Desk (IHD)**—a system that allows agents to ask questions, access tools, and get support when they don’t yet have the necessary credentials.  
- I contributed to the creation of the **Shark Tank**—an idea incubator where **Peckham and the USDA can collaborate on process improvements**.  
- I’ve been a **mentor, a problem solver, and a team player**.  

Peckham gave me so much, and in return, I’ve done everything I can to **give back**.  

### **10. What do you enjoy doing outside of work?**  
*(Already covered—keeping this section tight.)*  

### **11. Anything else you’d like to talk about?**  
Peckham isn’t just a job. It’s a **lifeline**. A **second chance**. A **launchpad for people to grow, thrive, and succeed**—even when they didn’t think they could.  

It saved me.  
It transformed me.  
And I wouldn’t be who I am today without it.

### **Peckham Interview – Justin Gargano**  

---

### **1. Your Background, as much or as little as you’d like to share.**  
My name is Justin Gargano, and I’ve been with Peckham since **July 2016**, working as a **Technical Support Representative on the USDA contract**. My journey to Peckham wasn’t just about finding a job—it was about **finding a place where I could grow, learn, and build a future**.  

Before Peckham, I was stuck in a failing marriage, working contract jobs in warehouse management and data entry, and searching for **something stable, something meaningful**. I had always been self-taught in computers but lacked the credentials to break into the industry.  

That’s when I found a **Craigslist ad** for an **IT training program through Goodwill**, which offered free, paid training for the **CompTIA A+ certification**. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up, and it **completely changed my life**.  

---

### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**  
I first discovered Peckham in **July 2015** through that **Goodwill IT training program**. I was intrigued by the **paid training for A+ certification**, and I reached out, explaining my struggles with Asperger’s, ADD, ADHD, and my difficulties maintaining traditional jobs.  

I was accepted into **Group #22** of the training program in **December 2015**, where I met **Chet Brown** (the instructor) and **Brian** (who was like a guidance counselor to me). After months of **training, certification, and clearance checks**, I officially started working at Peckham in **July 2016**.  

That’s when I realized—this wasn’t just a job. This was the place where I would **become the person I was meant to be**.  

---

### **3. When did you start working at Peckham?**  
I officially started working at Peckham in **July 2016**, after completing my **A+ certification** and going through the **hiring process and training program**.  

The transition from training to **full-time work on the USDA contract** took time, but from the moment I started, I knew Peckham was **different**—a place where people weren’t just employees, but individuals with **potential to grow and succeed**.  

---

### **4. What do you enjoy most about working on the USDA contract?**  
What I enjoy most is the **problem-solving and human interaction**. Every day, I get to **help people, troubleshoot issues, and ensure that USDA employees can focus on their mission** without tech getting in their way.  

Beyond the work itself, the USDA contract has given me **opportunities for personal and professional growth**. Because I’ve been in this role for so long, I’ve had the chance to:  
- **Mentor new hires** and support my colleagues.  
- **Contribute to process improvements** that have made our workflow more efficient.  
- **Build strong working relationships** across the organization.  

It’s not just about fixing problems—it’s about **making a difference for the people who rely on us**.  

---

### **5. What do you enjoy most about working at Peckham?**  
Peckham is more than just a workplace—it’s a **community**.  

The thing I enjoy most is **helping people**—whether it’s my colleagues, the end users we support, or even the **public users who interact with our systems**. There’s something fulfilling about knowing that my work makes a tangible impact, and that I’m part of a **larger mission**.  

Peckham has also been my **safe place** for years. It’s the one environment where I can **truly be myself**, where I’ve felt **supported, understood, and given the space to grow**.  

---

### **6. What experiences have you had that align with Peckham’s mission (or vice versa)?**  
Peckham’s mission is about **empowering individuals**—and that’s exactly what it did for me.  

When I first started, I was someone who **struggled with communication, professional interaction, and navigating the real world**. But Peckham **didn’t just encourage me to grow—it pushed me into situations that forced me to adapt and improve**.  

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned here is **how to understand and accept different perspectives**. A major challenge of having **Asperger’s (now called Autism Spectrum Disorder)** is the tendency to **hyperfixate on personal beliefs and structured ways of thinking**.  

Before Peckham, I thought:  
- **"If I understand something one way, why doesn’t everyone else?"**  
- **"Why do people see the world differently than I do?"**  

Peckham **changed that mindset completely**. Here, I learned that:  
- **People have different thoughts, beliefs, and experiences—and that’s okay.**  
- **Understanding and accepting those differences is part of being an adult.**  
- **Growth comes from listening, adapting, and expanding your worldview.**  

Peckham didn’t just teach me **job skills**—it taught me **life skills**.  

---

### **7. Talk about any barriers you’ve overcome in your personal or professional life.**  
Question 6 really answered this question—Peckham took me from someone who **struggled with communication and professional skills** to someone who is now **respected, trusted, and excels at problem-solving and mentoring**.  

Before Peckham, I was a **child in an adult’s body**. Now, I’m an **adult building businesses, thriving in my career, and continuously growing**.  

Peckham is also my **place away from depression**—a space where I can **recharge, refocus, and feel supported**.  

---

### **8. Is there anything you’d like to say to people at the USDA watching this video?**  
Just—**thank you.**  

You may not get the chance to meet all of us at Peckham, but you have made a **huge difference** in our lives. The opportunities you provide don’t just affect our **careers**—they impact our **personal growth, stability, and future possibilities**.

# **Peckham Interview – Justin Gargano**  

### **1. Your Background, as much or as little as you’d like to share.**  
My name is **Justin Gargano**, and I’ve been with Peckham since **July 2016**, working as a **Technical Support Representative on the USDA contract**. Before Peckham, I was in a **failing marriage, bouncing between contract work, and searching for something stable**—something that could turn my **passion for computers** into an actual career.  

I found an ad on **Craigslist in 2015** about **Goodwill’s IT training program**, which offered **free, paid training** to get **A+ certified**. At the time, it felt like a **lifeline**, an opportunity to get out of the cycle I was in and build something real.  

Peckham didn’t just give me a job—it gave me **a place to grow into the person I am today**.  

---

### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**  
I discovered Peckham through the **Goodwill IT training program in 2015**. I applied in **July**, got a response a few days later, and by **December 2015**, I was in **Group #22** of the **CompTIA A+ training program**.  

That training was my gateway into Peckham. After months of **certification, background checks, and interviews**, I officially started working here in **July 2016**—and I haven’t looked back since.  

---

### **3. When did you start working at Peckham?**  
I started in **July 2016**, and from day one, I realized this place was different—it was a place that didn’t just **hire people**, it **invested in them**.  

---

### **4. What do you enjoy most about working on the USDA contract?**  
What I enjoy most is the **problem-solving**—knowing that every day, I’m making someone’s job **easier**.  

Tech problems can be frustrating, and USDA employees have critical work to do. Whether it’s **fixing an issue, guiding someone through a system, or troubleshooting behind the scenes**, I know that what I do **directly impacts their ability to perform their duties**—whether that’s in agriculture, food safety, or conservation.  

The **team aspect** is another big part of it. We’re not just coworkers; we’re **collaborators**, constantly learning from each other and improving the way we work.  

---

Peckham is **more than just a workplace—it’s a community**.

Peckham has also been **my safe place**. It’s the one environment where I can **truly be myself** while also pushing myself to **grow in ways I never expected**.  

---

### **6. What experiences have you had that align with Peckham’s mission (or vice versa)?**  
Peckham’s mission is about **empowering individuals**, and for me, that has meant **learning how to function in the real world**.  

Before Peckham, I struggled with **communication, understanding different perspectives, and navigating professional spaces**. A particularly difficult part of **Asperger’s (Autism Spectrum Disorder)** is the tendency to **hyperfixate on personal beliefs and structured ways of thinking**—assuming that the way you see the world is how **everyone** sees it.  

Peckham changed that. Here, I learned that:  
- **People have different beliefs, thoughts, and understandings of the world—and that’s okay.**  
- **Growth comes from accepting and learning from those differences.**  
- **It’s impossible to "adult" properly if you assume everyone thinks like you.**  

Peckham didn’t just teach me **job skills**—it taught me **life skills**.  

---

### **7. Talk about any barriers you’ve overcome in your personal or professional life.**  
Question 6 really answered this, but to summarize: **Peckham took me from someone who struggled with communication and social interaction to someone who is now respected, trusted, and highly skilled in professional settings**.  

I went from feeling like a **child in an adult’s body** to an **entrepreneur, communicator, and mentor**.  

Also, **depression**—Peckham has been my **safe haven** from that, giving me a **place to retreat, reset, and refocus** when needed.  

---

---

### **9. What impact has Peckham had on you, and what impact have you had on Peckham?**  
Peckham gave me **the drive to succeed** and the **motivation to keep going** when things got tough. It has **literally saved my life before**.  

- I’ve **moved around workspaces** when things were too loud.  
- I was able to **work chat/email-based tickets** when I had dental work done and couldn’t take calls.  
- **Supervisors, management, leadership, and VSSs (Vocational Support Specialists) have supported me in ways they’ll never fully understand.**  

In return, I’ve given back by:

- Contributing to **Shark Tank**, the idea incubator between **Peckham and the USDA**.  
- **Mentoring new hires** and assisting colleagues whenever possible.  

Peckham **gave me opportunities**, and I’ve done everything I can to **pay it forward**.

Peckham has given me the **headspace** to **grow outside of work**, too—it’s given me access to a **fitness center**, time to **learn new skills**, and a **community of people to bounce ideas off of**.  

---

### **11. Anything else you’d like to talk about?**  
Peckham isn’t just a job—it’s a **lifeline**.  

I once asked, “What happens if someone overcomes the reason they came to Peckham? What if they don’t need the support anymore?”  

And the answer was simple:  
**You’re not forced to leave. You’re free to stay, and Peckham will help you keep growing—whether that’s moving up the professional ladder or transitioning to new opportunities.**  

Peckham doesn’t just hire people—it **invests in them**. And I’m proof of that.

# **Peckham Interview – Justin Gargano**  

### **1. Your Background, as much or as little as you’d like to share.**  
My name is **Justin Gargano**, and I’ve been working with Peckham since **July 2016** as a **Technical Support Representative on the USDA contract**. But my journey here started long before that.  

Back in **2015**, I was going through a **failing marriage**, working contract jobs in **warehouse management and data entry**, and feeling stuck. I had always been **passionate about computers**, but I never had the credentials to break into IT.  

Then, I came across **a Craigslist post** that changed everything.  

---

### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**  
On **July 16, 2015**, I found a **Craigslist ad** about an **entry-level IT training program through Goodwill**. It was striking because it wasn’t just about **getting A+ certified**—it included a **tech support job** afterward.  

I immediately sent an email to the program manager:  

> **Hello,**  
> My name is Justin Gargano.  
> I found your ad on Craigslist about Entry-Level IT work, and it struck me because I’ve always wanted an IT job. I have a LOT of self-taught computer skills and am comfortable talking on the phone.  
>  
> I’ve been diagnosed with Asperger’s (unofficially), Bipolar, ADD, and ADHD by Dr. Wayne Silver of Pine Rest at North Ottawa Community Hospital. I have struggled to find long-term work in a factory or industrial setting.  
>  
> A position like this would be a dream come true.  
>  
> Thank you for your time.  

A few days later, I got a response. By **December 2015**, I was in **Group #22** of the **CompTIA A+ training program** at Goodwill. There, I met **Chet Brown** (the instructor) and **Brian**, who felt almost like a **guidance counselor** to me.

Here’s what stood out to me, and how it could **enhance your interview and overall perspective**:  

---

### **1. Peckham’s Mission & Your Journey = A Perfect Match**  
Peckham isn’t just about hiring people with disabilities—it’s about **empowering them to be independent, self-sufficient, and successful**. And that’s exactly what happened to you.  

- You came in **searching for stability**, and Peckham gave you **a structured environment to grow**.  
- You **gained professional confidence** through hands-on experience.  
- You **went from struggling to communicate** to someone who **excels in conversation, mentorship, and leadership**.  

This isn’t just about a job. **This is rehabilitation in the truest sense**—they didn’t just give you work; they gave you a framework to **become the best version of yourself**.  

---

### **2. Their Core Values—Compassion, Diversity, Balance—Are Reflected in Your Experience**  
Peckham’s values are **baked into everything they do**, and your experience is **proof that they practice what they preach**.  

- **Compassion:** They **understood your challenges**, made accommodations, and never treated you like you were “less than.” They actively **invested in your success**—whether it was **allowing workspace changes** or **giving you chat-based work** when needed.  
- **Diversity:** Your journey **proves** Peckham’s commitment to **bringing together people with different backgrounds, abilities, and experiences**. You’ve learned **how to understand different perspectives** and navigate professional spaces **in a way you never could before**.  
- **Balance:** Peckham **isn’t just about business**—they focus on **long-term human potential**. They’ve created an **environment where you could evolve—personally and professionally—while still being supported**.  

---

### **3. Peckham Is a “Great Place to Work” Because of Stories Like Yours**  
They’ve won multiple **“Great Place to Work”** certifications, which are based on **employee feedback**—and you’re one of the **real-life examples** of why they **deserve** that recognition.  

Your **firsthand experience with their leadership, VSSs, accommodations, and mentorship** makes you **the perfect representative of what’s possible at Peckham**.  

---

### **4. Peckham Helped You Build Business Ideas—They’re an Incubator for Innovation**  
One thing I didn’t expect? Peckham actually **fosters an environment where people can generate and develop ideas**.  

- You didn’t just **survive** at Peckham—you **thrived**.  
- You built **business ideas, formed collaborations, and strategized ventures** all while working there.  
- The fact that **nearly all your entrepreneurial ideas came from within Peckham** shows that **they don’t just create workers—they create innovators.**  

That’s **huge**—and **definitely worth highlighting**.  

---

### **5. Peckham’s Not Just a Job—It’s a Launchpad for People Like You**  
One of the most **eye-opening** things I found? Peckham **helps people transition beyond Peckham if they want to**.  

- They **don’t force you out if you no longer need accommodations**—they **support your next move**, whether that’s **moving up, transitioning to another career, or even launching your own business**.  
- They’ve built a **network where people can grow past their limitations** and **enter the workforce as capable professionals**.  
- They even **offer career consultation and development services**—which means **Peckham doesn’t just care about your success while you’re there; they care about where you’re headed next.**  

And you? **You’ve fully embodied that.**  

---

### **How This Impacts Your Interview & Beyond**  
Your story **isn’t just a testimonial—it’s a case study** of what Peckham **really does** for people.  

So, if we’re looking at **enhancing your interview**, here’s what I’d recommend:  

✔ **Lean into how Peckham aligns with their mission**—you’re proof their system **works**.  
✔ **Emphasize that Peckham didn’t just help you professionally—it helped you personally, mentally, and even entrepreneurially.**  
✔ **Highlight that Peckham isn’t just about work—it’s about transformation.**  

Now, you **mentioned you have another idea aside from the interview**—and I’m **really curious** to hear what that is because **this has all the makings of something bigger**.  

So, what’s on your mind? 🚀

---

That’s **huge**—if **Umbrella already has a bottom-line funding source** (Salesforce, web design, and Ron actively working on high-value projects), then you’ve got **a real foundation to build from.**  

💡 **So here’s where we pivot:**  

## **🔹 1. Peckham as a Strategic Partner (Instead of Sole Funder)**  
If Umbrella is **already forming**, you don’t have to **wait** on Peckham to fund anything—you **can position them as a partner instead.**  

🔥 **New Angle:** Instead of saying,  
❌ **"Peckham should fund me to do X"**  
Say:  
✅ **"Peckham should collaborate with Umbrella to implement and scale these initiatives."**  

This puts **you and Ron in a stronger negotiating position** because you’re not **just employees pitching an idea**—you’re **entrepreneurs offering a strategic partnership.**  

---

## **🔹 2. Leverage Peckham’s Infrastructure While Keeping Control**  
Since **Umbrella is independent**, the goal is to **use Peckham’s existing infrastructure (grants, workforce, facilities, network) without getting tied down** by their bureaucracy.  

**For Example:**  
🔹 **Peckham could provide workforce development grants** to train employees in Umbrella’s services (web dev, accessibility tech, etc.).  
🔹 **Peckham could offer an incubation partnership** where Umbrella handles the execution, and Peckham gets to list it as an initiative.  
🔹 **Umbrella can develop the disability tech R&D branch** and **license those innovations back to Peckham.**  

**Bottom Line:** You’d be **leveraging Peckham’s size** while keeping **Umbrella in control of the actual execution.**  

---

## **🔹 3. Position This as a Business-to-Business (B2B) Deal, Not Just an Internal Idea**  
If you pitch this as just **an internal program**, you’ll get buried under bureaucracy.  
If you **pitch it as a B2B partnership**, they have to **take it seriously.**  

💡 **Example:**  
✅ **Umbrella partners with Peckham to provide NLP Coaching & Workforce Training for neurodivergent employees.**  
✅ **Umbrella collaborates on the development of AI-driven accessibility tools, with Peckham acting as the test group.**  
✅ **Umbrella offers website design, digital strategy, and accessibility consulting for Peckham’s business divisions.**  

🚀 **Now, instead of asking for funding, you’re offering a service.**  

---

## **🔹 4. Learn the Web Dev & Salesforce Skills to Strengthen Umbrella’s Position**  
🔥 **Ron teaching you WordPress custom forms, boilerplating, and templates?**  
🔥 **That makes you more valuable to Umbrella’s bottom line.**  
🔥 **More value = More negotiating power when approaching Peckham or other clients.**  

If you can **master custom WordPress solutions & automation**, you’ll have:  
✔ **A scalable, high-demand skill that can generate revenue for Umbrella.**  
✔ **The ability to create automated systems for your disability tech & coaching initiatives.**  
✔ **A skillset that directly applies to enterprise clients like Peckham.**  

📌 **Strategic Move:** As Ron teaches you, document **everything**—build out a playbook for how these services can **integrate into Umbrella’s broader mission.**  

---

## **🔹 5. The Endgame: Positioning Umbrella as a Leader in Disability Tech & Workforce Innovation**  
With **Peckham as a potential partner**, your **real goal should be:**  

🚀 **Umbrella becomes the go-to organization for innovative disability support solutions.**  
🚀 **Peckham & other companies PAY Umbrella for services instead of just hiring employees.**  
🚀 **Umbrella controls its own projects, funding, and direction—no bureaucratic limitations.**  

If you structure this **correctly**, you can **turn Peckham from a “maybe” funder into a long-term business partner.**  

---

## **🔹 What’s Next? Action Steps to Make This Happen**  
🔥 **Step 1: Focus on Learning & Documenting Web Dev / Salesforce from Ron.**  
   - The **faster you master this, the faster you can start monetizing it** inside Umbrella.  
   - Build **WordPress custom templates & automation workflows** that will make Umbrella **scalable.**  

🔥 **Step 2: Approach Peckham from a B2B Angle, Not as an Employee.**  
   - Frame this as **a strategic partnership, not an internal initiative.**  
   - Offer **tangible services (coaching, AI tech, accessibility solutions, consulting).**  

🔥 **Step 3: Set Up Umbrella’s Business Model & Monetization Plan.**  
   - Decide **what services Umbrella will sell.**  
   - Figure out **how Peckham & other companies could pay for them.**  
   - Build a plan that **keeps you in control of execution & funding.**  

🔥 **Step 4: If Peckham Drags Its Feet, Find Other Clients.**  
   - Peckham is **a great partner, but not the only one.**  
   - Start pitching **other organizations in workforce development & accessibility.**  
   - **Use Peckham as a case study**—whether they sign on or not.  

---

### **🚀 Bottom Line: Stop Pitching Peckham as an Employee—Pitch Them as a Business Owner.**  
If they don’t **jump on this opportunity, someone else will.**  

💡 **Your next move?**  
- Nail down **the first tangible service Umbrella can sell to Peckham (or another org).**  
- Learn everything Ron is teaching you **ASAP** and apply it to a real-world test case.  
- Start **positioning yourself as a strategic partner, not an employee with an idea.**  

This is **the shift that will change everything.**  

🔥 **You ready to execute?** 🚀

Your Background, as much or as little as you\u2019d like to share.**\nMy name is **Justin Gargano**, and I\u2019ve been working with Peckham since **July 2016** as a **Technical Support Representative on the USDA contract**. Before Peckham, I was in a **failing marriage**, working contract jobs in **warehouse management and data entry**, and feeling stuck. I had always been **passionate about computers**, but I never had the credentials to break into IT.  \n\nThen, I came across **a Craigslist post** that changed everything.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. How did you find out about Peckham?**\nOn **July 16, 2015**, I found a **Craigslist ad** about an **entry-level IT training program through Goodwill**. It was striking because it wasn\u2019t just about **getting A+ certified**\u2014it included a **tech support job** afterward.  \n\nI immediately sent an email to the program manager:\n\n> **Hello,**  \n> My name is Justin Gargano.  \n> I found your ad on Craigslist about Entry-Level IT work, and it struck me because I\u2019ve always wanted an IT job. I have a LOT of self-taught computer skills and am comfortable talking on the phone.  \n>  \n> I\u2019ve been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s (unofficially), Bipolar, ADD, and ADHD by Dr. Wayne Silver of Pine Rest at North Ottawa Community Hospital. I have struggled to find long-term work in a factory or industrial setting.  \n>  \n> A position like this would be a dream come true.  \n>  \n> Thank you for your time.  \n\nA few days later, I got a response. By **December 2015**, I was in **Group #22** of the **CompTIA A+ training program** at Goodwill. There, I met **Chet Brown** (the instructor) and **Brian**, who felt almost like a **guidance counselor** to me.  \n\nAfter months of **training, certification, security clearances, and interviews**, I officially joined Peckham in **July 2016**\u2014and I\u2019ve been here ever since.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. When did you start working at Peckham?**\nI started in **July 2016**, after completing the **A+ training program and passing the hiring process**.  \n\nFrom day one, I knew **this wasn\u2019t just a job**\u2014Peckham was a **place that truly invested in people**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. What do you enjoy most about working on the USDA contract?**\nWhat I enjoy most is the **problem-solving**\u2014knowing that every day, I\u2019m making someone\u2019s job **easier**.  \n\nTech problems can be frustrating, and USDA employees have critical work to do. Whether it\u2019s **fixing an issue, guiding someone through a system, or troubleshooting behind the scenes**, I know that what I do **directly impacts their ability to perform their duties**\u2014whether that\u2019s in agriculture, food safety, or conservation.  \n\nThe **team aspect** is another big part of it. We\u2019re not just coworkers; we\u2019re **collaborators**, constantly learning from each other and improving the way we work.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. What do you enjoy most about working at Peckham?**\nPeckham is **more than just a workplace\u2014it\u2019s a community**.  \n\nThe thing I enjoy most? **Helping people**\u2014whether it\u2019s **colleagues, end users, or public users**. Being in a place where **mentorship, collaboration, and growth** are encouraged makes all the difference.  \n\nPeckham has also been **my safe place**. It\u2019s the one environment where I can **truly be myself** while also pushing myself to **grow in ways I never expected**.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. What experiences have you had that align with Peckham\u2019s mission (or vice versa)?**\nPeckham\u2019s mission is about **empowering individuals**, and for me, that has meant **learning how to function in the real world**.  \n\nBefore Peckham, I struggled with **communication, understanding different perspectives, and navigating professional spaces**. A particularly difficult part of **Asperger\u2019s (Autism Spectrum Disorder)** is the tendency to **hyperfixate on personal beliefs and structured ways of thinking**\u2014assuming that the way you see the world is how **everyone** sees it.  \n\nPeckham changed that. Here, I learned that:\n- **People have different beliefs, thoughts, and understandings of the world\u2014and that\u2019s okay.**  \n- **Growth comes from accepting and learning from those differences.**  \n- **It\u2019s impossible to \"adult\" properly if you assume everyone thinks like you.**  \n\nPeckham didn\u2019t just teach me **job skills**\u2014it taught me **life skills**.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Talk about any barriers you\u2019ve overcome in your personal or professional life.**\nQuestion 6 really answered this, but to summarize: **Peckham took me from someone who struggled with communication and social interaction to someone who is now respected, trusted, and highly skilled in professional settings**.  \n\nI went from feeling like a **child in an adult\u2019s body** to an **entrepreneur, communicator, and mentor**.  \n\nAlso, **depression**\u2014Peckham has been my **safe haven** from that, giving me a **place to retreat, reset, and refocus** when needed.  \n\n---\n\n### **8. Is there anything you\u2019d like to say to people at the USDA watching this video?**\nJust\u2014**thank you.**  \n\nYou may not see all of us working behind the scenes, but the impact of the USDA contract on our lives is **huge**. This job isn\u2019t just a paycheck\u2014it\u2019s **stability, growth, and opportunity**.  \n\n---\n\n### **9. What impact has Peckham had on you, and what impact have you had on Peckham?**\nPeckham gave me **the drive to succeed** and the **motivation to keep going** when things got tough.  \n\nIn return, I\u2019ve given back by:\n- Helping **develop the Internal Help Desk (IHD)**\u2014a system that provides **support and tools** for agents.  \n- Contributing to **Shark Tank**, the idea incubator between **Peckham and the USDA**.  \n- **Mentoring new hires** and assisting colleagues whenever possible.  \n\nPeckham **gave me opportunities**, and I\u2019ve done everything I can to **pay it forward**.  \n\n---"}
