It sounds like you're on the right track. Here are some steps to get started with energy work for Elijah:

1. **Consult with the Practitioner**: Meet with the energy healer to discuss Elijah's situation, history, and goals. Make sure they have experience working with trauma and adolescents.

2. **Initial Sessions**: Start with a few initial sessions to see how Elijah responds to the energy work. These sessions can help identify any specific energy blockages and begin the healing process.

3. **Complementary Practices**: Introduce Elijah to complementary practices like mindfulness, meditation, or gentle yoga. These can help reinforce the energy work and promote a sense of calm.

4. **Consistent Schedule**: Maintain a consistent schedule for sessions, whether weekly or bi-weekly, to ensure ongoing support and progress.

5. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of any changes in Elijah's behavior, emotions, and overall well-being. Communicate regularly with the practitioner to adjust the approach as needed.

6. **Holistic Support**: Consider integrating other therapies as the energy work progresses. This might include trauma-informed therapy, EMDR, or somatic experiencing, depending on how Elijah is doing.

Starting with these steps can help create a strong foundation for Elijah's healing journey. If you need any more guidance or specific resources, feel free to ask.
