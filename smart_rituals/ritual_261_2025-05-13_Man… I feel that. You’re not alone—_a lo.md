## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Man… I feel that. You’re not alone—**a lot of players had that same quiet hope** that by maxing out all the prepper stars, rebuilding the chiral network, and pushing the world into that golden state of unity and perfection... **the game might acknowledge it.** That somehow you'd **loop the timeline** or even **earn a more fulfilling “true” ending** where the inauguration unfolds differently—or happens *again* with you ready this time.

But yeah, *Death Stranding*’s Chapter 15 is a **post-narrative sandbox**, not a second timeline. Here’s what’s really going on:

---

### 🧭 Why Chapter 15 Feels Like It *Should* Loop

- **“Tomorrow is in your hands”** — the game basically dares you to keep *building*, keep *delivering*, keep *connecting*. It feels like a timeline meant to be redeemed.
- Sam even gets lines like *“Guess we just pass the time until the inauguration…”* — but the **inauguration never comes.**
- The **calendar freezes**—that "two weeks prior" moment is a kind of eternal return. You're not progressing forward; you're living in a liminal space.

---

### 🎮 The Game Mechanics Want Closure. The World Doesn’t.

- You can:
  - 5-star every prepper.
  - Complete every standard order.
  - Deliver every lost cargo.
  - Collect all 56 memory chips.
  - Get every zipline perfect from coast to coast.

- But you can’t:
  - Trigger the inauguration again.
  - See Amelie, Deadman, or BB post-Ch.14.
  - Alter the ending or shift the fate of the world.

It’s **philosophical, not practical**: Kojima essentially gives you the reins of the world *after* its major narrative function has concluded. **It’s your world now—but you can't rewind fate.**

---

### 🔄 What to Do With That Feeling

You’re chasing something real—**the longing for closure, return, or redemption.** In DS, that never comes externally.

But if you *roleplay it*, you can make it meaningful:
- Pretend every five-star is a **vote of confidence** for a better future.
- Your work becomes **Sam's personal peace**, not a world event.
- You become **legend** not because the world sees it—but because you still *choose to act* after the story “ends.”

---

### 💡 Optional Headcanon / Ritual

Want to give it some closure anyway?

You could create your **own “inauguration moment”**:
- 5-star every prepper.
- Deliver one last gift to each one (e.g., favorite cargo).
- Return to Amelie’s Beach.
- Sit still. Let the waves pass. Speak a vow: *“The bridges are built. The strand holds.”*

Then shut the game off like it’s a **sacred closing ceremony**. Or go back out and keep walking. Your choice.

---

**You’re not wrong to feel let down by the non-return.** But that ache is kind of the point: we keep connecting, even if the world doesn’t reward it with fireworks.

Still… if Kojima ever drops a DLC where the inauguration *does* happen again—**you earned it 10 times over already.**
