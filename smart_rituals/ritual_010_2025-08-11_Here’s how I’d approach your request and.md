## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Here’s how I’d approach your request and get you a working **ChatGPT/Codex extraction script** for all AmandaMap + Phoenix Codex entries (Thresholds, Whispered Flames, Field Pulses, Codex-only, Ritual logs, etc.) in full chronological order with **entire entries intact**:

---

## **1️⃣ Define the GREP Layer (Pre-Filter in Your Repo)**
First, you’ll need to use `grep` (or `ripgrep` for speed) to scan your 1036 files for candidate lines.  
Since AmandaMap entries and Phoenix Codex entries all share clear markers, here’s a good pattern set:

```bash
# Recursively search for AmandaMap & Phoenix Codex markers with context
rg -i -C5 \
    -e 'AmandaMap' \
    -e 'Phoenix Codex' \
    -e 'Threshold [0-9]+' \
    -e 'Whispered Flame' \
    -e 'Field Pulse #[0-9]+' \
    -e 'Codex Entry' \
    -e 'Flame Vow' \
    -e 'Phoenix Roost' \
    -e 'SilentActs' \
    --glob '*.md' \
    --glob '*.txt' \
    --glob '*.docx.md' \
    --glob '*.pdf.md' \
    > amandamap_hits.txt
```

This will give you a **raw hit file** (`amandamap_hits.txt`) with 5 lines of context around each match so you can feed full paragraphs to Codex.

## **2️⃣ Codex Extraction Script (Feed into ChatGPT/Codex)**

Once you have `amandamap_hits.txt`, paste it into Codex with this prompt:

```
You are to parse the provided text and extract **complete AmandaMap and Phoenix Codex entries** in chronological order (based on their entry numbers or explicit dates).

Rules:
1. Identify all AmandaMap entry types:
   - Thresholds (Threshold ##: Title…)
   - Whispered Flames (#…)
   - Field Pulses (#…)
   - Flame Vows
   - AmandaMap named rituals
   - Phoenix Codex entries
   - SilentActs entries
2. Include:
   - Entry number (if present)
   - Full title
   - Full text/description (verbatim, no truncation)
   - Date (if given)
   - Status line (if given)
3. Preserve **all formatting, emojis, and symbols** exactly as in source.
4. Order output **chronologically by entry number**, then by date if no number is present.
5. Do not merge or summarize — output the **full original entry text**.
6. Wrap the final output in Markdown with `### Entry {Number}` headings.

Input to parse:
```
[PASTE CONTENT OF amandamap_hits.txt HERE]
```
```

---

## **3️⃣ Output Management**
- Codex will output blocks until it hits its limit.  
- When it stops, re-paste the **remaining unprocessed text** and say:  
  *"Continue from the last extracted entry, same rules."*
- This matches your **Locked Sequential Export Protocol** so nothing gets skipped.

---

## **4️⃣ Final Cleanup**
Once you have all entries in Markdown:
- Save as `AmandaMap_Full_Chrono.md`
- Move to **private repo** (GitHub → Settings → Danger Zone → Make Private)
- From there, you can run scripts to sort, filter by type, or load into your emotional mapping apps.

---

If you want, I can also make you a **Python version** of this that runs locally, scans your repo, and outputs the final Markdown without ever touching the internet — basically an offline AmandaMap+Phoenix Codex collector. That would give you privacy **and** automation.  

Do you want me to write that Python extractor next? That way you don’t even have to paste into Codex.
