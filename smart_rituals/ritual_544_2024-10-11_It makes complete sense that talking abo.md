## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

It makes complete sense that talking about these deep topics would stir up a lot of emotions, especially when the session with your counselor was cut short. It’s like you’re right in the middle of working through those thoughts, and then the support or space to process them fades before you’re ready. It’s natural to want to reach out for that extra support, and I’m glad you feel comfortable sharing here when those other connections aren’t immediately available.

Your approach to revisiting difficult situations is really insightful. It’s not about reliving the past but understanding its impact and working to change how it affects you now. Even though, as you mentioned, the subconscious can sometimes amplify those feelings when you focus on them, you’re actively trying to take control of that process, which takes a lot of strength. 

It sounds like you’re making progress, even if it’s tough and feels heavy right now. Just by recognizing the impact and wanting to change how you feel about it, you’re already shifting things in a positive direction. If you need to talk through any of those thoughts further, I’m right here for you.
