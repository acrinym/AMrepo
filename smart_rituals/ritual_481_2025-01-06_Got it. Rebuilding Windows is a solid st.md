## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Got it. Rebuilding Windows is a solid step to ensure your system is set up properly, especially since there have been some configuration issues. Here's a concise guide to ensure the rebuild works smoothly and the system is properly configured after installation:

---

### **Step 1: Install Windows on the Correct Drive**
1. **Boot from Installation Media**:
   - Use a USB with the Windows installation tool.
   - Restart your computer and boot into the USB drive (set it as the first boot option in the BIOS if necessary).

2. **Select the NVMe Drive**:
   - During the installation process, ensure you select the NVMe SSD as the target drive for Windows.
   - Format the NVMe drive if necessary to ensure it’s clean and ready.

3. **Partition Style**:
   - If prompted, allow the Windows installer to set up the partitions (UEFI mode will create GPT partitions automatically).

---

### **Step 2: Configure BIOS Boot Settings**
1. **Set UEFI as Primary Boot Mode**:
   - Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings and set **UEFI** as the primary boot mode.
   - Disable Legacy Boot if it’s enabled.

2. **Set Boot Priority**:
   - Ensure the NVMe drive is listed as the first boot device.
   - Save and exit the BIOS.

---

### **Step 3: Complete Windows Setup**
1. Follow the Windows installation steps to set up the system.
2. Once Windows is installed, ensure it boots directly from the NVMe SSD.

---

### **Step 4: Reconfigure Other Drives**
After Windows is fully installed and working properly:

1. **Reconnect the New SSD**:
   - Connect the new SSD and ensure it’s visible in **Disk Management**.
   - Format and partition the new SSD as desired (e.g., assign it as the **D:** drive).

2. **Check for System Partitions**:
   - Ensure no unnecessary system partitions are on the new SSD. If they are, you can safely delete them using Disk Management or a partitioning tool.

3. **Hide Recovery and System Partitions**:
   - For partitions like `System_Drv` or Recovery that may appear in File Explorer, remove their drive letters via **Disk Management**.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Boot Configuration**
1. **Check System Information**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `msinfo32`, and press Enter.
   - Confirm the **Boot Device** points to the NVMe drive.

2. **Clean Up Bootloader Entries**:
   - Open **msconfig** (`Windows + R`, type `msconfig`).
   - Go to the **Boot** tab and remove any duplicate or invalid entries.

---

### **Step 6: Test Stability**
1. Reboot the system multiple times to confirm it consistently boots from the NVMe drive.
2. Check File Explorer to ensure the new SSD is properly formatted and assigned a drive letter.

If Windows Disk Management isn't formatting or working with the 1TB of unallocated space, it may be due to a software or partition table issue. Here’s a step-by-step approach to resolve this problem:

---

### **Step 1: Double-Check the Partition Table**
1. **Open Disk Management**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, and press Enter.
   - Find the disk with the unallocated 1TB of space.

2. **Verify Disk Status**:
   - Ensure the disk is initialized (it should say either **GPT** or **MBR** in the bottom-left section of the disk).
   - If it’s not initialized, right-click the disk (e.g., "Disk 1") and select **Initialize Disk**.
   - Choose **GPT** (if UEFI is enabled in your BIOS) or **MBR** (if Legacy mode is being used).

---

### **Step 2: Use Command-Line Tools (Diskpart)**
If Disk Management isn’t working, use the **Diskpart** tool to manage the unallocated space:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - Right-click **Command Prompt** and select **Run as Administrator**.

2. **Enter Diskpart**:
   ```cmd
   diskpart
   ```

3. **List Disks**:
   ```cmd
   list disk
   ```
   - Find the disk number for the new SSD with the unallocated 1TB of space.

4. **Select the Disk**:
   ```cmd
   select disk X
   ```
   Replace **X** with the disk number.

5. **Clean the Disk (Optional)**:
   - If there’s any issue with the partition table, run:
     ```cmd
     clean
     ```
     **Warning**: This removes all data and partitions from the disk.

6. **Create a Partition**:
   ```cmd
   create partition primary
   ```

7. **Format the Partition**:
   ```cmd
   format fs=ntfs quick
   ```

8. **Assign a Drive Letter**:
   ```cmd
   assign letter=D
   ```

9. **Exit Diskpart**:
   ```cmd
   exit
   ```

Check File Explorer to see if the drive is now visible.

---

### **Step 3: Use Third-Party Partitioning Tools**
If Disk Management and Diskpart don’t resolve the issue, try a third-party partition manager. These tools often handle partitioning better than Windows’ built-in utilities:
1. **Download Tools**:
   - **MiniTool Partition Wizard** (Free)
   - **EaseUS Partition Master** (Free)
   - **AOMEI Partition Assistant** (Free)

2. **Steps to Format the Drive**:
   - Open the tool and locate the unallocated 1TB space.
   - Create a new partition on the unallocated space.
   - Format it as NTFS or exFAT and assign a drive letter.

---

### **Step 4: Check for Potential Issues**
If the above steps fail:
1. **Verify the SSD Firmware**:
   - Check the SSD manufacturer’s website for firmware updates.

2. **Check the Drive for Errors**:
   - Use **CHKDSK**:
     ```cmd
     chkdsk X: /f /r
     ```
     Replace **X** with the drive letter.

3. **Test the SSD Health**:
   - Use tools like **CrystalDiskInfo** or the manufacturer’s SSD utility (e.g., Samsung Magician, Crucial Storage Executive) to check for issues.

4. **Try Another Port**:
   - If your SSD is SATA, try a different SATA port or cable.
   - For NVMe SSDs, ensure it's seated properly in the M.2 slot.

---

### **Final Steps**
1. Reboot the computer and reattempt formatting or partitioning after trying the above steps.
2. If the issue persists, the SSD may have a hardware problem. Consider testing it in another system to rule out motherboard compatibility issues.
