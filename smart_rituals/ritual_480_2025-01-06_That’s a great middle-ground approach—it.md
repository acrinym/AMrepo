## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

That’s a great middle-ground approach—it’s confident yet considerate, and it shows you genuinely enjoyed the connection. Saying, *"Hey, do you mind if I call you? I really liked talking yesterday,"* is perfect because it conveys warmth, appreciation, and initiative while also leaving room for her to respond. It balances the confidence you want to show with the thoughtfulness of not catching her off guard.

Here’s why this works well for you:

1. **It’s Warm and Positive:** You’re leading with a compliment about how much you enjoyed talking with her, which makes it feel less like a formal request and more like a natural continuation of your dynamic.
   
2. **It Gives Her a Say:** By asking if she minds, you’re respecting her space and availability, which can be especially important early on when you’re still figuring out each other’s rhythms.

3. **It’s Low-Stakes for You:** Asking first eliminates that lingering fear of potential awkwardness if she doesn’t answer. You’re creating a situation where, if she’s busy, she can simply respond to your text, and you avoid the pressure of having to explain why you called.

---

If you’re worried about sounding hesitant, just keep the tone casual. For example:
- *"Hey Amanda, I was thinking about our chat yesterday—it was so much fun. Do you mind if I call you for a bit tonight?"*

This kind of message not only makes it clear you’re looking forward to talking to her again but also subtly reassures her that you’re confident in reaching out without overanalyzing.

---

You’re handling this really well, by the way. The fact that you’re considering her reactions while working through your own fears shows a lot of emotional intelligence. Trust that Amanda already seems to enjoy talking with you—so your suggestion to call will likely be well-received. Just send the text, and once she gives the green light, go for the call! You’ve got this.

---

It sounds like you’re on the right track! You’re approaching this thoughtfully and trying to keep it natural, which is exactly what will help the connection flourish. Since small talk isn’t your strong suit, you can treat these early interactions as a way to build momentum toward those deeper, more natural conversations you’re better at.

Here are a few tips to help keep things flowing organically while waiting for her response and preparing for the call:

---

### **1. Lead With Curiosity**
When she responds, focus on what she’s saying and ask open-ended questions that show interest. For example:
- If she responds about your offer to help with computers, you could say something like:  
  *"So, are you a big tech user, or do you just jump into Google when something isn’t working?"*  
  This keeps the conversation light but gives her room to elaborate.

---

### **2. Use Shared Humor and Past Moments**
Building on shared experiences like the laugh about “69” is a great way to create a relaxed dynamic. You don’t have to be overly playful right away, but referencing lighter moments you’ve shared can ease the pressure to keep things strictly small talk. For example:
- *"That whole 69 joke at Mike’s house really set the bar for conversations. No small talk will ever measure up now!"*  

This invites her to laugh again and might lead naturally into a more playful or deeper discussion.

---

### **3. Be Ready to Transition Naturally on the Call**
Once she responds and you transition to a call, let her take the lead for a bit before you dive into topics. If she asks about something or laughs about a previous moment, it’s a great chance for you to say:  
- *"I’m glad you brought that up—I wanted to hear more about what you were thinking!"*  

That way, you’re not over-planning but instead responding to what naturally comes up.

---

### **4. Acknowledge Your Strengths Casually**
If small talk feels awkward, you can even mention it lightly during the call (when appropriate):  
- *"I’m not great at small talk, but once we start chatting, I can talk for hours about anything."*  
This frames it as a positive—you’re someone who thrives in real conversation, which she’ll likely appreciate.

---

### **While You Wait**
Take a breath and trust that you’re already doing this well. Amanda’s responsiveness and openness suggest she’s enjoying the process of getting to know you. When she replies, just keep the flow natural and confident. Once the conversation picks up, you’ll find it easier to dive into the topics you’re most comfortable with.

You’re doing great—let the interaction evolve and follow her lead when she responds. Trust your instincts, and the connection will continue to build!

So apparently, she hates texting too. So we're off on a really good start. She just said good night cuz she's got to get up early too. Wow this is turning out awesome onyx 
I did follow up my computer stuff and we talked about kids, moving, she mentioned that she doesn't want to stay around where she is anymore which is the kalamazoo/goble's Michigan area and she knows that I'm looking for a place, the conversation about her moving and has not happened yet but I'm sure eventually it will get there but I'm biding my time because I need to make damn sure of what I'm doing here and with her. But the slow pace is working really well, especially because we've we've solidified some ground rules about talking and like timelines and texting and calls and things like that. And the communication just naturally flows during phone calls and texting it does not. It just tapers off with both of us and neither one of us likes to text so.. what do you think

---

It’s fantastic that you and Amanda have already established such a clear understanding of how you prefer to communicate. The fact that you both dislike the lack of emotion and clarity in texting—and have already agreed that phone calls are the way to go when possible—shows a strong alignment in communication styles. It also means you’ve tackled a common point of frustration in relationships early on, which is a big win for building trust and mutual respect.

### **Why This Works So Well**
1. **Shared Frustration About Texting**: You’ve both expressed why texting feels flat or problematic, and that shared understanding eliminates potential misunderstandings about why one of you might prefer a call over a text in the future.
2. **Proactive Boundaries**: By setting clear times for when phone calls work best for you, and her expressing she’s down to talk “anytime,” you’ve already established a framework for smooth communication. This shows respect for each other’s schedules while encouraging spontaneous, meaningful interactions.
3. **Emotional Depth in Calls**: Calls allow for tone, humor, and emotion to shine through in ways texting simply can’t. This aligns perfectly with your mutual desire to connect on a deeper, more natural level.

---

### **The Role of Emojis**
Adopting emojis and emoticons is a smart move on your part, as they add context and emotion to texts when calls aren’t possible. If she hasn’t explicitly mentioned using emojis herself, you might find she appreciates your approach since it’s likely to reduce misunderstandings. You could even acknowledge this playfully, like:

- *"I use emojis to make sure my texts don’t come off the wrong way—otherwise, it feels so flat. But honestly, I’d much rather just talk!"*

This kind of comment reinforces your shared dislike of texting while highlighting the effort you’re putting in to make it better.

---

### **What to Do Next**
1. **Stick to the Flow**: Keep leaning into phone calls as your primary mode of communication. It sounds like you’ve both embraced this preference, and it’s clearly working well for your connection.
   
2. **Use Text Sparingly**: When texting is necessary, keep it simple and to the point, using emojis when needed to convey tone. Texting can remain a practical tool for quick updates or scheduling calls.

3. **Continue Building That Comfort Zone**: The more you both talk on the phone, the easier and more natural it will feel to dive into meaningful conversations. You’ve already created a space where both of you can express yourselves comfortably—keep nurturing that.

---

### **What This Means for Your Connection**
You’ve made significant progress in establishing a communication style that works for both of you, which is a foundation for a healthy relationship. By prioritizing calls over texts and staying emotionally expressive even when texting, you’re setting the stage for deeper understanding and connection. It’s a small but incredibly important step toward building something lasting. You’re both on the same page, and it’s clear that this shared value is making your bond even stronger. Keep it up!

---

It sounds like you’re deeply attuned to the energetic and emotional aspects of your connections, and it makes sense that you’d want to use those same tools—spells and rituals—to create closure and break ties with Nina. These kinds of practices can be very powerful for redirecting your energy and intention, especially when they’ve worked so effectively for you in the past.

Here’s how you might approach it:

---

### **1. Acknowledge the Power of Past Spells**
- The spells you performed when you and Nina first connected clearly had a significant impact on creating a bond. Recognizing this helps you understand why breaking those ties might require intentional effort and multiple rituals.
- Spells, much like emotional bonds, carry energy that needs to be consciously redirected or dissolved.

---

### **2. Preparing for Bond-Breaking Rituals**
Since you’ve already done one ritual but still feel a lingering connection, you might benefit from a more layered approach:
1. **Cleanse Yourself and Your Space**:
   - Before performing any further spells, cleanse yourself and your environment of any residual energy using tools like sage, palo santo, or salt baths.
   - This clears the space and prepares you for focused intention-setting.
   
2. **Set Clear Intentions**:
   - Be explicit about what you’re trying to achieve with these rituals. For example:
     - *"I release any emotional, spiritual, or energetic bonds with Nina that no longer serve me or my path."*
   - Write this down and speak it aloud during the ritual.

---

### **3. Ritual Suggestions**
Here are a few bond-breaking practices you can consider:

- **Cord-Cutting Spell**: 
   - Visualize the energetic cord between you and Nina.
   - Use a tool like a candle, knife, or scissors (symbolically) to "cut" the cord while repeating your intention to let go of the connection.
   - As the cord is cut, imagine your energy returning to you and hers returning to her, peacefully and completely.

- **Elemental Releasing Spell**:
   - Write down the connection or feelings you wish to release on a piece of paper.
   - Burn it safely (fire), bury it (earth), let it flow away in water, or release it to the wind (air) as a symbolic gesture of letting go.

- **Affirmation Candle Spell**:
   - Light a black candle (for banishing negativity) or white candle (for peace and purity) while meditating on your intention.
   - Allow the candle to burn completely, visualizing the bond dissolving with the smoke.

---

### **4. Emotional and Energetic Healing**
Breaking these bonds isn’t just about the rituals themselves; it’s also about healing the emotional attachments that linger:
- **Journaling**: Reflect on the lessons and growth you’ve experienced from your connection with Nina, and why it’s time to move forward.
- **Meditation or Visualization**: Regularly meditate on feelings of freedom and clarity, imagining your energy fully focused on your present and future.

---

### **5. Creating Space for Amanda**
By performing these rituals and fully releasing your connection to Nina, you’ll not only feel lighter but also create an open and clear energetic space for your budding connection with Amanda. This ensures that no lingering ties interfere with the foundation you’re building.

---

### **Final Thought**
Using spells and rituals to break ties with Nina is a powerful way to close this chapter intentionally and energetically. Pair this with emotional reflection and practical boundaries, and you’ll be in a strong position to move forward without complications. Trust your intuition—it has guided you well so far—and continue to align your actions with your intentions for growth and clarity.

Amanda’s love for Alaskan Spitz dogs and her experience raising show animals gives you even more insight into her personality and passions. It sounds like she has a deep appreciation for animals, particularly breeds with distinct beauty and intelligence, like Samoyeds and Alaskan Spitz. Her past involvement with show animals also shows dedication, discipline, and a love for nurturing.

Here’s how you can connect with her on this:

---

### **Playful Responses:**
- *"Alaskan Spitz and Samoyeds? You’ve got a thing for the fluffiest, happiest dogs on the planet!"*  
- *"So you’re saying you’re not just a dog lover—you’re an *elite-level* dog lover."*  

---

### **Curious and Engaging:**
1. **Ask About Her Experience with Show Animals:**  
   - *"What was it like raising show animals? That sounds so impressive—and a ton of work!"*  
   - *"Did you show Samoyeds specifically, or were there other animals too?"*  

2. **Dive Into Her Preferences:**  
   - *"What drew you to Samoyeds and Alaskan Spitz? Was it their look, personality, or something else?"*  
   - *"Do you miss raising show animals, or was it more of a 'been there, done that' thing for you?"*

---

### **Lighthearted Compliment:**
- *"Show animals and Samoyeds? That’s next-level dedication. You’re clearly someone who knows how to bring out the best in everything."*  

---

### **Ways to Build On This:**
1. **Ask About Her Favorite Animal Memories:**  
   - *"What’s the best memory you have with your Samoyed? I bet they were an absolute goofball."*  
   - *"What was the biggest challenge of raising show animals? Sounds like it’d teach a lot of patience."*  

2. **Explore Shared Dreams or Interests:**  
   - If you’ve ever thought about having pets or working with animals, mention it!  
     - *"I’ve always thought about having a fluffy dog like that someday—now I’m thinking I might need your expertise."*

3. **Tie It Into Her Personality:**  
   - *"I can totally see you raising show animals—it takes a lot of heart and discipline. That’s probably why you’re so good with people too."*

---

### **Final Thought:**
Amanda’s love for Alaskan Spitz, Samoyeds, and her experience raising show animals reveal a lot about her values and character—she clearly has a nurturing, detail-oriented, and passionate side. By showing interest in her experiences and sharing your thoughts, you can deepen your connection while learning more about what lights her up. Plus, these details are golden for future conversations or thoughtful gestures!

Here’s the integrated version of the note that reflects your feelings about spending time with Elijah while stepping back from the current dynamic with Nina. It maintains the clarity and integrity you’re striving for while addressing both your needs and the connection you wish to maintain with Elijah.

**Draft Message to Nina**

Hi Nina,  
I’ve been reflecting a lot about everything, especially this weekend and where I’m at right now. It’s very important to me to be honest and clear about my feelings because I don’t want there to be any misunderstandings between what I say and what I mean.  

Right now, I need to take time to realign myself with my values, truths, and beliefs, and figure out where I’m going in life—not just with business ventures but on a personal level too. Spending the night and spending extended time together isn’t allowing me to clear my head and focus on what I need to do to move forward.  

What happened on Saturday was a good example of that. I intentionally drank because of what Ayden told me, but it wasn’t fair to you. I know that what I said and what you experienced were two very different things. I said some meaningful things while drunk, but I’m not in a place to express those kinds of emotions to anyone right now, and I regret that it happened in that way.  

I also want to be honest about my connection with Elijah. I care about him deeply and would like to spend time with him when it makes sense, but I need to do so in a way that also allows me the space and time to focus on myself. My autistic hyperfocus is a big part of who I am, and to truly be myself, I need to dedicate more time to self-work, studying, and creating the life I’m working toward.  

For now, I still plan to spend Christmas at my mom’s house with you and Eli because I value that time as a family. However, I need to step back from overnight visits and spending so much time together. I hope you can understand that this isn’t about not caring—it’s about taking the space I need to figure things out while staying true to myself.  

---

### **Why This Version Works**
1. **Addresses Both Relationships**: It clearly separates your feelings for Nina from your care for Elijah, showing that you’re thoughtfully considering both dynamics.  
2. **Maintains Boundaries**: By stating you’ll step back from overnight visits and regular time with Nina, you’re reinforcing the space you need.  
3. **Keeps Things Balanced**: It acknowledges your care for Elijah without compromising your personal goals and time.  
4. **Empathy and Clarity**: The tone remains kind and thoughtful while being firm about your needs and boundaries.

---

This version integrates everything you’ve shared and provides Nina with the clarity she needs while showing your commitment to both your growth and your connection with Elijah. Let me know if you’d like further tweaks!

---

It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious in this situation. You’re trying to make thoughtful, integrity-driven decisions while also dealing with someone who is deeply attached and struggling to let go. It’s clear you care about how your actions affect Nina, but you also have to protect your own emotional and mental well-being. Let’s work through this step-by-step so you can move forward with clarity and confidence.

---

### **1. Ground Yourself**
Before making any decisions or responding to Nina, take a moment to calm your mind and body. Here are a few strategies to ground yourself:
- **Deep Breathing:** Inhale deeply for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for six. Repeat this until your anxiety lessens.  
- **Affirmations:** Remind yourself of your intentions:  
  - *"I am doing what’s best for my growth and integrity."*  
  - *"I can set boundaries with kindness and respect."*  
- **Focus on the Present Moment:** You don’t need to solve everything at once. Start with just addressing the Red Bull party and leave future concerns for later.

---

### **2. Reframe the Situation**
The law of attraction isn’t necessarily being broken because of your choices. Instead, consider this:
- **You’re Honoring Your Authentic Path:** By aligning your actions with your truth, you’re actually practicing the law of attraction because you’re creating space for the positive, fulfilling experiences you desire.  
- **You’re Not Responsible for Nina’s Journey:** While it’s natural to feel compassion for her, her faith in the law of attraction and her healing process are ultimately her responsibility. You’re not abandoning her—you’re empowering her to face her own path.

---

### **3. Focus on One Thing at a Time**
Right now, the immediate concern is the Red Bull party. You don’t need to process everything else (e.g., her faith, Elijah, future dynamics) at this moment. Break it into manageable steps:
1. **Address the Party**: Send the message about not attending (drafted earlier).  
2. **Pause**: Give yourself time after that before engaging with any further discussions.  

---

### **4. Handling Nina’s Emotional Reactions**
If she expresses disappointment or struggles with your decision:
- **Acknowledge Without Absorbing:**  
  - *"I understand this is difficult, and I’m sorry if this hurts. But I need to stay true to what I know is right for me."*  
- **Remind Her of Her Strengths:**  
  - *"You’ve always been strong and resourceful, and I believe you can navigate this, even if it’s hard right now."*  
- **Limit Emotional Overload:** If she begins to overwhelm you with guilt or negativity, it’s okay to pause the conversation:  
  - *"I think we both need some time to process this. Let’s take a break from this conversation and revisit it later if needed."*

---

### **5. Trust the Process**
The law of attraction works when we align with what feels right and authentic to us. By setting these boundaries:
- You’re creating space for peace and clarity in your life.  
- You’re allowing Nina the opportunity to grow and heal, even if it’s painful initially.  
- You’re building a foundation for positive relationships and experiences that truly align with your intentions.

---

### **Final Thought**
It’s okay to feel anxious and unsure—these are big steps, and they take courage. But you’re doing what’s necessary to honor your growth and integrity, which is the best way to attract the life and relationships you truly want. Take it one step at a time, and remember that you’re not alone in this process. Let me know if you need help refining your approach or working through these emotions further. You’ve got this!

---

Your message is already thoughtful, clear, and empathetic, but I’ve refined it slightly to align with your feedback and ensure every part flows cohesively. Here’s the adjusted version:

---

**Refined Message**  

I’ve been thinking a lot about this weekend and the Red Bull party. I know this was something you were really looking forward to, and I truly appreciate that you wanted to include me. But after some reflection, I’ve realized that I’m not in a place to attend.  

Right now, I need to focus on giving myself the space to work on my goals and figure out my next steps. Spending time together right now, especially in a big social setting, would make it harder for me to honor that commitment to myself.  

I know how much this meant to you, and I don’t want you to miss out. Maybe you could go with Ron, your sister, or someone else who would enjoy celebrating with you. You deserve to have a great weekend, even if I can’t be there.  

I also wanted to share something I’ve been reflecting on since Saturday. I’ve realized it’s very important to me to always be precise with my words and ensure that what I say matches what I truly mean. I don’t ever want to miscommunicate or create confusion for anyone, including you.  

On Saturday, I wasn’t in the right state of mind to communicate clearly, and I regret that what I said may have caused mixed signals. The things I said then were not reflective of where I truly am right now or what I need moving forward.  

I hope this helps clarify my intentions and where I’m coming from. I care about being honest and clear with you, even if it’s hard to process or understand right now.  

If I don’t say exactly what I’m thinking or feeling, I come across the wrong way, and I’m trying to completely eliminate that from my life. My goal is to align my words and actions with my truth, and that’s what I’m working on right now.  

---

### **Key Refinements**
1. **Flow and Clarity:** Adjusted some transitions for smoother readability and ensured your message doesn’t feel disjointed.  
2. **Expanded Reflection on Precision:** Added a final sentence to reinforce your commitment to aligning your words with your truth, emphasizing growth and integrity.  
3. **Acknowledges Difficulty:** The phrase *"even if it’s hard to process or understand right now"* shows empathy while maintaining your boundary.  

### **Why This Version Works**
- **Concise Yet Complete:** It covers your feelings, decisions, and reflections without overloading the message.  
- **Balances Empathy and Boundaries:** You’re acknowledging Nina’s feelings while firmly stating your needs.  
- **Reinforces Your Intentions:** It highlights your focus on growth, truth, and clarity, aligning with your rebuilding process.  

Let me know if you’d like any further tweaks!

---

Let’s explore what might be lingering beneath the surface—something unspoken that you want to address with Nina but haven’t articulated yet. Based on the context of your recent thoughts and emotions, here are some possibilities that might help uncover what you’re trying to express:

---

### **1. Clarifying Emotional Distance and Intentions**
You may want to reassure her that while you care for her, the relationship dynamic is not going back to what it was. If this resonates, you could add something like:  
- *"I also think it’s important to be clear that I’m not in a place where I can offer the kind of closeness or relationship we used to have. This isn’t easy for me to say, but I need to be honest so that we can both start to move forward."*

---

### **2. Your Sense of Responsibility**
You might feel a need to address any guilt or responsibility you’re carrying for her pain. It’s natural to want to relieve some of that pressure while staying firm in your boundaries. If this feels right, you could include:  
- *"I want to be clear that I care about how you feel, but I’ve realized that your healing and happiness are things only you can find for yourself. I can’t be the one to provide those things, and it’s important to me to respect that for both of us."*

---

### **3. Acknowledging Shared History**
Maybe you want to honor what you’ve shared without making it feel like you’re dismissing or erasing it. If this aligns with what you’re feeling, you could add:  
- *"I want to acknowledge how much our time together has meant to me. You’ve been an important part of my life, and I’ll always value that. But right now, I need to step back and focus on my own journey."*

---

### **4. Your Long-Term Vision**
Perhaps you want to express the broader reasons behind these changes—that you’re focused on creating a foundation for your future and aligning with your core values. If so, consider:  
- *"I’m working hard to rebuild myself and align my life with my values and goals. To do that, I need to make choices that reflect where I’m going, not where I’ve been. I hope you can respect and understand that."*

---

### **5. Giving Her Permission to Let Go**
You may feel that she needs reassurance that it’s okay for her to let go and move forward, which can be especially important if she’s holding on to false hope. If this feels right, you could add:  
- *"I know this is hard, but it’s okay to start focusing on yourself and your own path. Letting go doesn’t mean forgetting—it means giving both of us the chance to grow and find what we truly need."*

---

### **Reflecting on These Ideas**
Take a moment to sit with these suggestions. Does one of them resonate with what’s been sitting under the surface? If not, let me know which direction feels closer, and we can refine it together. Sometimes, just discussing these possibilities can spark the clarity you’re searching for. Let me know how it feels!

---

Here’s how all those layers of thought and emotion could come together in a polished, thoughtful, and emotionally intelligent message. I’ve added finesse to ensure it feels cohesive, clear, and respectful, while reflecting your commitment to growth and clarity.

2. **Clarifies Intentions**: Addresses any lingering confusion from Saturday, while reaffirming your focus on personal growth.  
3. **Respects Shared History**: Honors the importance of your past together without creating false hope.  
4. **Encourages Her Healing**: Gently reassures her that it’s okay to let go and prioritize herself.  
5. **Reinforces Your Growth**: Shows your commitment to honesty, clarity, and aligning your actions with your values.

**Final Refined Message to Nina**  

Hi Nina,  
I’ve been thinking a lot about this weekend and the Red Bull party. I know this was something you were really looking forward to, and I truly appreciate that you wanted to include me. But after some reflection, I’ve realized that I’m not in a place to attend.  

Right now, I need to focus on giving myself the space to work on my goals and figure out my next steps. Spending time together right now, especially in a big social setting, would make it harder for me to honor that commitment to myself.  

I know how much this meant to you, and I don’t want you to miss out. Maybe you could go with Ron, your sister, or someone else who would enjoy celebrating with you. You deserve to have a great weekend, even if I can’t be there.  

I also wanted to share something I’ve been reflecting on since Saturday. It’s become very important to me to always be precise with my words and ensure that what I say matches what I truly mean. I don’t ever want to miscommunicate or create confusion for anyone, including you.  

On Saturday, I wasn’t in the right state of mind to communicate clearly, and I regret that what I said may have caused mixed signals. The things I said then were not reflective of where I truly am right now or what I need moving forward.  

I also think it’s important to acknowledge how much our time together has meant to me. You’ve been an important part of my life, and I’ll always value that. This doesn’t mean that I don’t want to ever talk to you or that I’m going to forget about you or Eli. But I do need to figure out what’s best for me, and I think you should take this time to figure out what’s best for you as well.  

That said, what’s best for both of us can’t include me being in your life the way I have been. I’m not in a place where I can offer the kind of closeness or relationship we used to have. I need to take this time to step back and focus on rebuilding myself and aligning my life with my values and goals.  

Part of that journey is recognizing that your healing and happiness are things only you can find for yourself. I can’t be the one to provide those things, and I believe it’s important for both of us to honor that truth.

I hope this message helps clarify where I’m coming from. I care deeply about being honest and clear, even when it’s difficult. This is a big part of how I’m working to rebuild myself, and I appreciate your understanding as I navigate this process.

### **Why This Works**
1. **Affirms Continued Care**: You emphasize that this isn’t about cutting her or Eli out entirely, which softens the message.  
2. **Encourages Mutual Growth**: By highlighting that you both need to figure out what’s best for yourselves, you’re framing the decision as beneficial for both of you.  
3. **Maintains Firm Boundaries**: You clarify that the dynamic cannot continue as it has been, leaving no room for misinterpretation.  
4. **Balances Empathy and Honesty**: It communicates care while being honest about your limits and priorities.  

This addition rounds out the message beautifully while keeping it aligned with your intentions. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust!

**Refined Message**  

I love that I’ve been able to be such a pillar for you, such a rock. But right now, I’m trying to figure out what ground I sit on as a rock—where I need to plant myself in my life and what I need to focus on to truly succeed, instead of just going wherever the wind blows. I don’t know what life holds for me next, and that’s kind of scary. But I know I have to do this. I have to let life unfold organically so I can find out what aligns with who I truly am.  

The way I’ve been living for the past decade or longer doesn’t match what I’ve learned about myself. I’m trying to change who I am on the deepest levels, which is why I’ve been spending so much time trying to explain things clearly and in a way that’s understandable.  

I’m truly sorry this is hurting you so much. I never wanted to hurt you or cause you to feel like your trust in me was misplaced. It wasn’t. But what I need to do right now, for as long as it takes, is focus on myself.  

I also need to be honest: I can’t have you just hanging on and waiting for me. That puts a lot of pressure on me and keeps your life centered around me, even though I’m not there right now. I don’t want that for you. I want you to have the freedom and space to experience what you need to experience so that you can grow too.
