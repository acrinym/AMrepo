Actually, FAT32 does not have a limit of 40 GB for partitions. The confusion around this limit often comes from certain operating systems, particularly older versions of Windows, which restricted formatting FAT32 drives to a 32 GB partition size when using built-in tools like the Disk Management utility. However, the technical limits of FAT32 are different:

1. **Partition Size Limit**: FAT32 can technically support partition sizes up to 2 TB (terabytes), though some tools might limit you to creating partitions smaller than this. Third-party formatting utilities can create and manage FAT32 partitions larger than 32 GB, which can be useful if you want to use FAT32 on a larger drive.

2. **File Size Limit**: The more practical limitation of FAT32 is its maximum file size of 4 GB. This means that no single file can be larger than 4 GB on a FAT32-formatted drive, which is usually the bigger constraint when working with larger files like videos or disk images.

For storing MP3 files or other smaller data, a FAT32 partition can be much larger than 40 GB, making it suitable for larger music libraries if formatted with the right tools. If you need to create a FAT32 partition larger than 32 GB, tools like Rufus, EaseUS Partition Master, or other third-party disk utilities can bypass the built-in Windows limitation.
