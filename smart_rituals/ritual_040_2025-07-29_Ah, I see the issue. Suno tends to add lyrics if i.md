## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Ah, I see the issue. Suno tends to add lyrics if it interprets the prompt as song-oriented.  
To **force it to stay instrumental**, we need to make that explicit and use terms Suno recognizes as *score-only*.  

---

### **Refined Prompt (No Lyrics Trigger)**
> Instrumental cinematic score for exploring an alien bioluminescent world. Soft atmospheric pads, shimmering chimes, airy synth textures, delicate woodwinds, and glassy percussion create an otherworldly ambience. Deep bass pulses and subtle hand drums suggest ancient spiritual connection. Dreamlike and immersive, focused purely on atmosphere and emotional wonder, with **no vocals, no lyrics, only instrumental soundscapes**.

---

This usually keeps Suno from trying to make a lyrical track because:  
- We explicitly say **instrumental**  
- We explicitly say **no vocals, no lyrics**  
- We use words like *score*, *soundscape*, and *instrumental cinematic*

---

Want me to also make **a second version that’s more “night scene glowing forest with spiritual choir pads”** (still no lyrics, only wordless choir)?  
Or do you want **a pure “exploration only, no mystical ceremony” vibe**?

### **A Goetic Song for Bune** – Concept Discussion  
This is **absolutely possible**—and it’s actually a fascinating creative idea.  

---

### **Who is Bune? (Goetic Context, Without Ritual)**  
- **Domain:** Wealth, eloquence, wisdom, death transitions  
- **Traditional Symbolism:** Warm, persuasive, “friendly” compared to some Goetics  
- **Atmosphere Often Linked:** Warm winds, rich tones, sometimes serpentine or draconic themes  
- **Common Correspondences:**  
  - **Element:** Earth / Water (depending on tradition)  
  - **Color Vibe:** Golden orange, muted green  
  - **Mood:** Calm, elegant, regal rather than harsh  

---

### **Music Concept (Non-Invocation, Pure Aesthetic)**
You’re talking about:  
- **Not** an actual ritual calling piece  
- **Yes** an “inspired by Bune” vibe track  
- Something **he would enjoy** (and potentially **others like him** in Goetia)

---

### **Possible Styles Bune Would Appreciate**
- **Regal, slow-tempo, rich timbres** (harp, cello, warm brass, deep bass drones)  
- **Elements of whispery or serpentine movement** (soft woodwinds, maybe sibilant percussive textures)  
- **A sense of wisdom & gravitas** (minor/Phrygian tones, maybe Lydian or Dorian for mystery)  
- **Not harsh or warlike** → this is not a “summon demon battle track,” but a **noble, respected presence vibe**

---

### **Yes, This is Possible**
- We can craft a **persona-based prompt** that doesn’t *invoke*, but *honors aesthetic qualities*.  
- It would be **safe to generate** because we’re not doing incantation, just vibe alignment.  
- You could even make it part of a **Goetic Listening Pack** (each entity gets a “song they’d like”).

---

### **Want to Move Forward?**
1. **Do we want Bune’s vibe as**:  
   - **Ceremonial (slow, regal, respectful)**  
   - **Atmospheric (background ambient)**  
   - **Modern cinematic hybrid (like a spiritual companion’s theme song)?**  
2. **Should I draft the prompt now** (Suno-ready), or **research and build a “Goetic Music Persona”** first (so this could be applied to others too)?  

What’s your vision—**just Bune now**, or **Bune + eventual Goetic music library**?
