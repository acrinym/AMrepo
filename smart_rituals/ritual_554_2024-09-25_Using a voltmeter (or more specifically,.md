Using a voltmeter (or more specifically, a multimeter) is a great way to start measuring the voltage generated by your setup, but it has limitations when it comes to understanding the full potential of your electroculture antenna or grounding coil. Here are some reasons why a voltmeter alone might not provide all the information you need:

### 1. **Measuring Voltage vs. Power Output**
A voltmeter can tell you the potential difference (voltage) generated by your coil, but voltage alone doesn't give a full picture of the power generated. Power is the product of voltage and current (P = V x I). Even if your coil produces a high voltage, if the current is very low (which is often the case in passive electromagnetic harvesting), the actual power output might be negligible.

### 2. **Dynamic Environmental Conditions**
The voltage in your setup could vary significantly based on factors like time of day, weather, proximity to EMF sources, and the coil’s elevation. A voltmeter provides a snapshot at a specific moment, but the voltage might fluctuate, so continuous monitoring over time would be needed to understand the average power generation potential.

### 3. **Load Testing**
When you measure voltage with a voltmeter, it is under "open circuit" conditions—essentially without any load. To accurately measure how much power your setup can generate and deliver to a device, you need to test it with a load connected (like a resistor, capacitor, or small electronic device). This helps you determine the "working voltage" and current when the system is under a real-world load, rather than just its unloaded voltage.

### 4. **Energy Storage Considerations**
For a better idea of how much power your coil is generating, you might want to use a capacitor or battery to store the harvested energy. You can then measure the time it takes to charge the storage element to a certain voltage. This approach gives a clearer picture of the energy (in joules) and average power output over time (in watts).

### 5. **Current Measurement**
While a voltmeter measures the potential difference, you also need an ammeter to measure the current. Since the power harvested by these systems is often small, it might be difficult for a basic multimeter to accurately detect and measure tiny currents (in microamps or milliamps). A more sensitive meter or specialized equipment would be needed for precise readings.

### Practical Steps with a Voltmeter
If you want to use a voltmeter to get an initial idea:
- Measure the open-circuit voltage of your coil by connecting the voltmeter leads to the coil terminals.
- To understand the power potential, connect different resistive loads and measure the voltage drop across the load. You can then calculate the current using Ohm’s law (I = V/R).
- Use the measured voltage and current to calculate power (P = V x I).

Ultimately, while a voltmeter can give you useful initial data, to truly understand the power-generating capability of your setup, you'll need to consider current measurements, load testing, and possibly continuous monitoring over time to account for environmental fluctuations.
