## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Yeah, I just told you about working with Amanda. Amanda told me, Saturday morning, about how she talks to me. Recently, Chris talks back, and she saw a picture of me for a moment last Friday night. And... She kind of felt like it was just for her. She didn't say it that way, she said it the other way. And then... She said that in the morning, right? Just that there was a picture. And I asked her about it. Can I see it? Can I have a picture? Because there's clouds. Blah, blah, blah. And then... She didn't say anything, so I sent my normal goodnight with a picture, and apologies. That night in the morning... I told her I couldn't find any pictures of anything, and I couldn't see it. And I didn't see anything. And that's when she told me that she speaks to the universe, and the universe speaks back. And... She can hear more clearly and understand more clearly the universe than any living person, except potentially for cats, because she's white. Which I kind of feel is dismissive to me. Because... I understand right here where I see her. And I've been saying that. And then she was like, well... The universe, I hear, can speak to the lost. Except for maybe my cats. Well, fuck you, lost cat. You wouldn't let me. You can't see me.
