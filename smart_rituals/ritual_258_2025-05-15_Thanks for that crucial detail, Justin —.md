## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Thanks for that crucial detail, Justin — that shifts the diagnosis. If the UI **isn't displaying at all**, here's what's likely happening:

---

## 🔥 Root Cause: `isWhitelisted()` Is Killing Initialization

The code probably contains this at or near startup:

```js
if (!isWhitelisted()) return;
```

That line **terminates execution completely** for **non-whitelisted** sites.  
But **you want it to display normally on non-whitelisted sites**.

---

### 🧠 Recap of Intended Behavior:

- **Whitelisted** ➜ show *emoji/minimized*.
- **Not whitelisted** ➜ show *full UI*.

But the script **inverted this**:
- ❌ `!isWhitelisted()` ➜ `return` (block).
- Which means: **all non-whitelisted sites = script kill.**

---

## ✅ Correct Fix – Exact Snip & Replace

### 🔍 FIND:
```js
if (!isWhitelisted()) return;
```

### ✅ REPLACE WITH:
```js
if (isWhitelisted()) {
    isMinimized = true; // minimize to emoji for whitelisted sites
}
```

This way:
- Full Hermes UI shows on non-whitelisted domains ✅
- Emoji-only minimized UI on whitelisted domains ✅
- Script runs on *all* domains (no hard block) ✅

---

## 🛠 Bonus: If the UI Still Doesn’t Show

If that fix is in place but **you still don’t see Hermes**, then:

1. Make sure `setupUI()` is being called **unconditionally** in the script.
   Look for something like:

   ```js
   setupUI();
   ```

   It should **not** be gated behind any `if` that checks `isWhitelisted()` or other logic.

2. Search the code for any of these patterns:
   - `return;` without a logging statement (silent fails)
   - `if (!document.body) return;`
   - `if (!isWhitelisted()) return;` (again, common culprit)

3. Use browser console (F12 > Console tab) to see if `console.log("Hermes: Starting...")` or similar shows up.

## 🚀 Ready to Rebuild?

Want me to:
- **Fix this line**
- **Ensure `setupUI()` runs on all pages**
- Output a working `.user.js` file with all that corrected?

Just say the word and I’ll generate the rebuilt version for you now.

---

🔥 You nailed the exact spot.

You're pointing out this final piece in the script:

```js
// Start Hermes
initialize();

})();
```

Let’s break it down in full technomantic clarity:

---

## ✅ What’s Working Right Here

- The script **wraps in an IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) – `(() => { ... })();`
- `initialize()` is correctly **called after all definitions**, just before the function closes
- The comment `// Start Hermes` confirms it was intended to fire last

So yes — this is exactly where Hermes should launch.

---

## ❗ But Here's the Catch

If you haven’t **patched the logic inside `initialize()`** yet, then this call still hits this block:

```js
function initialize() {
    if (!isWhitelisted()) {
        console.log('Hermes: Site not whitelisted, skipping initialization');
        return;
    }
```

Which means: **even though you’re calling `initialize()`, it still does nothing** unless you're on a whitelisted domain.

👁️ That’s why it *looks* like Hermes isn’t starting.

---

## ✅ Corrected `initialize()` – Final Working Version

Here’s exactly what it should be for your intent:

```js
function initialize() {
    if (isWhitelisted()) {
        isMinimized = true; // 🟢 Show emoji-only UI on safe-listed domains
    }

    loadProfileData();
    loadMacros();
    loadCustomMappings();
    loadWhitelist();
    loadCustomThemes();
    setupUI(); // 🧱 Build the interface, regardless of site
    startMutationObserver();
    HermesDebug.start();

    console.log('Hermes: Initialized');
}
```

> 🔁 No `return;`, no short-circuiting. Full load on every domain, minimize only on whitelisted ones.

---

## 🔒 If You Want to Add Failsafe Logging

For debugging stubborn silent fails, optionally append:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
    if (!document.getElementById('hermes-shadow-host')) {
        console.warn("Hermes: UI not found — possible init fail.");
    }
}, 1500);
```

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- ✅ `initialize()` is called correctly at the bottom
- ❌ But old `if (!isWhitelisted()) return;` logic aborts it
- 🔁 Replace with `if (isWhitelisted()) isMinimized = true;`
- 🎯 Then Hermes works exactly as you intend

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Output a fully corrected `.user.js`
- Add a dev hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+H`) to toggle visibility
- Or help theme/tweak it further

Just say the word: **“Build it, Onyx.”**
