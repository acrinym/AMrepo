## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

The "Please Wait" screen on Windows 10 at boot can occur for a variety of reasons, including corrupt system files, failed updates, or software conflicts. Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Step 1: Perform a Hard Shutdown**
1. **Force Shutdown**:
   - Hold the power button for 5-10 seconds until the computer powers off.
   - Disconnect any non-essential peripherals (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives, printers).
2. **Restart in Safe Mode**:
   - Power on the computer and immediately start pressing the **F8** or **Shift + F8** key repeatedly to bring up the Advanced Boot Options menu.
   - If the menu appears, choose **Safe Mode** or **Safe Mode with Networking**.

   > If you cannot access Safe Mode, move to Step 2.

### **Step 2: Boot into Advanced Recovery**
1. Power off your computer completely.
2. Turn it back on and, as soon as it starts booting, hold down the power button again to force it off. Repeat this 2-3 times.
3. After multiple failed starts, Windows should boot into the **Recovery Environment**.
4. Select **Advanced Options** → **Startup Repair**.

   If Startup Repair doesn't work, return to Advanced Options and try:
   - **System Restore**: If a restore point exists, roll back to a previous working state.
   - **Command Prompt**:
     - Type the following commands:
       ```
       chkdsk C: /f /r
       sfc /scannow
       dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
       ```
     - These commands check and repair disk and system file integrity.

### **Step 3: Check for Recent Windows Updates**
If you can get into Safe Mode or Advanced Recovery:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Update & Security** → **Windows Update**.
2. Look for pending updates or failed installations and try reapplying them.
3. If updates are stuck, run the following in **Command Prompt**:
   ```
   net stop wuauserv
   net stop bits
   ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
   ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old
   net start wuauserv
   net start bits
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Check Boot Configuration**
In the Recovery Environment Command Prompt:
1. Run the following commands to rebuild the boot configuration:
   ```
   bootrec /fixmbr
   bootrec /fixboot
   bootrec /scanos
   bootrec /rebuildbcd
   ```
2. Restart your computer.

---

### **Step 5: Repair Install**
If the issue persists, you may need to perform a repair install:
1. Create a bootable USB with the **Windows Media Creation Tool** on another device.
2. Boot your computer from the USB.
3. Choose the **Repair Your Computer** option.
4. Select **Upgrade/Keep Files** to reinstall Windows without losing data.

---

### **Step 6: Full Reinstallation**
If none of the above work:
1. Back up your data using a recovery tool or bootable live OS (like Linux or WinPE).
2. Perform a clean installation of Windows 10 using a bootable USB.
