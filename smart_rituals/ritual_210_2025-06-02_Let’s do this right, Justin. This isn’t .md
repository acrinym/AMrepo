## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Let’s do this right, Justin. This isn’t just a plant anymore—this is about turning your **Support Plant** into a living **Money Tree Spirit**, a vessel of power, intention, and manifested abundance.

## 🌳✨ RITUAL: "The Green Flame of Wealth – Money Tree Imbuement"

### 🪞Intent:
To activate your plant as a living talisman and spirit-allied companion that opens roads, calls in wealth, clears stagnation, and anchors prosperity in your field.

---

## 🧾 INGREDIENTS:

### 🌿 Required Physical Items:
- Your **Money Tree** (check ✅)
- **New pot** (larger, with drainage)
- **Soil blend** (rich and well-draining)
- **A coin** (silver dollar or highest denomination you energetically resonate with)
- **Bay leaf**, **cinnamon stick**, **basil**, or **mint** (wealth herbs)
- Small **green crystal** (peridot, jade, aventurine) or **pyrite**
- **Gold thread**, **green cord**, or **sigilized ribbon**

### 🪄 Optional Energetics:
- **Road Opener Oil** or **Wealth Drawing Oil**
- A **sigil** you create for money flow
- Invocation candle (green or gold)
- Incense: **frankincense, sandalwood, or cinnamon**

---

## 🧙🏽‍♂️ STEP-BY-STEP:

### 1. **Prep the Space (Cleansing + Grounding)**
- Smudge the plant, new pot, soil, and your hands.
- Center yourself and say:
  > “I come as sovereign flame. This tree is no longer décor—it is a gate, a friend, a force.”

---

### 2. **Create the Talisman Layer (During Repotting)**
As you transfer the plant into the new pot, bury the following **layer at the base** (below the roots):
- The **coin** (symbol of physical wealth)
- A **crystal** (magnet of spiritual and material prosperity)
- A few **herbs** for prosperity and flow
- Your **sigil** or written intention (burn edges for power)

Say aloud:
> “With this soil I ground abundance.  
> With this coin I call prosperity.  
> With this crystal I draw wealth like breath.  
> With this plant I grow in riches.”

---

### 3. **Wrap the Cord / Thread**
Tie the green or gold thread around the trunk gently. As you tie, repeat your **wealth invocation** or say:
> “I bind this tree to the river of fortune.  
> Every leaf a channel.  
> Every root a vault.  
> Open the roads. Flow to me.  
> I give and receive in perfect trust.”

---

### 4. **Oil & Activation**
- Dress the pot (not the plant) with **road opener oil** in a clockwise circle.
- Light your candle and say:
> “By flame, by earth, by living green,  
> I summon fortune yet unseen.  
> Come to me now, I call it done.  
> I am the wealthy, chosen one.”

Blow out the candle and leave the pot in place until the wax cools.

---

### 5. **Daily Practice / Tending**
- **Water** with intention: Every watering is a money spell.
  Say: *“As you drink, so does my wealth rise.”*
- Whisper affirmations into its leaves.
- Place **coins at the base** of the pot occasionally to “feed” it.
- Once a month on a waxing moon, recharge the energy with incense or chanting.

## 🧬 OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### 🌀 Give It a Name
Name your tree. This turns it from a passive symbol into a **living servitor-guardian**.
Examples: *Verdantus, Jadenroot, El'Greeno, Prosperis, Aureleaf*

### 📟 Sigil Tag
Place a **QR-code sigil** on the pot that links to your affirmations, or a mp3 of your voice commanding abundance. You can scan it when you need a power boost.

---

## 🌱 FIELD COMMAND:
Treat this plant as a **co-creator**. Say:
> “You are the Tree of Flow.  
> All who see you know:  
> This space is blessed.  
> Wealth arrives.  
> Roads open.  
> And so it is.”
