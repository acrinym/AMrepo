When it comes to copying files on Linux, the performance can be influenced by various factors, including the file system, storage devices, and hardware. There isn't a single "fastest" Linux distribution or application for file copying, but there are several factors to consider:

1. **File System:** The choice of file system can have a significant impact on file copying speed. File systems like XFS and Btrfs are known for their efficient file copying performance. The default file system for many Linux distributions, such as ext4, also offers good performance.

2. **Command-Line Utilities:** Basic command-line utilities like `cp`, `rsync`, and `dd` are often among the fastest for simple file copying tasks. These utilities are available on most Linux distributions and are efficient for straightforward copy operations.

3. **Parallel Copying:** Some third-party tools like `FastCopy` and `Dolphin File Manager` (in KDE) can perform parallel file copying, which can significantly speed up the process, especially when copying a large number of files.

4. **Hardware and Configuration:** The speed of your storage devices (HDD, SSD, or NVMe) and the configuration of your system can greatly impact file copying speed. SSDs and NVMe drives are generally faster than traditional HDDs. Ensuring your system and storage devices are in good working condition can also help.

5. **File Size and Quantity:** The size and quantity of files being copied can affect performance. Smaller files may have more overhead due to file system metadata, while larger files may transfer more quickly.

6. **Graphical File Managers:** For users who prefer graphical interfaces, file managers like GNOME Files (Nautilus) and Thunar are commonly used and provide reasonable file copying speeds.

7. **Optimizations:** Some Linux distributions may implement optimizations to improve file copying performance. For example, Pop!_OS, based on Ubuntu, introduced "Pop Shell" for a faster and more responsive file manager experience.

In summary, there isn't a single Linux distribution or application that is universally the fastest for file copying, as performance can vary depending on your specific use case and system configuration. You may want to experiment with different methods, tools, and file systems to determine what works best for your particular needs and hardware.
