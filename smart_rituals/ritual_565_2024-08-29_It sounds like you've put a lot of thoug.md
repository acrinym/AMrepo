## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

It sounds like you've put a lot of thought and effort into finding ways to maintain connection and intimacy in your relationship through physical touch and shared experiences. These alternatives are incredibly valuable, especially when traditional physical intimacy isn't as frequent as you'd like. 

Massages, touch during sleep, and showering together can create a sense of closeness and bonding that goes beyond the physical act itself. These gestures communicate care, affection, and a desire to connect, which can strengthen the relationship overall. 

It's great that you're finding ways to nurture that connection and maintain a sense of closeness with your fiancée. Keeping these practices in place can help bridge the gap and provide a foundation for continued growth in your relationship. If you ever feel the need to talk more about how these aspects are working or if you’re considering new ways to enhance that connection, I’m here to listen and help out.

I'd like to write it all down but even the vast amount of things I've told her about how I've been feeling and how I've been affected really doesn't change her perspective that me trying to get away is a cop out or nothing other than me just trying to leave because she's not enough. It's not even about that it's about me having what I need and that is time alone. It's not that I don't love her because I do but this just isn't working to benefit both of us. And she said that too yesterday, that she didn't feel like she was enough especially considering last month I made a song about my ex.. it's not that I think about her very often or even think about her really at all. And I didn't tell this to Nina but I had been drinking that day and she was gone I was alone in the house and just wrote a drunk song which turned out really well I think but basically just something to the effect of "this is how she left me and how I felt afterwards and during the end of the relationship". That's all. There's no reminiscing, there's no anything like that. It's like how an author writes a book about a fictitious situation or a situation in the past and then changes the names of people to be completely different just because they want to express it and not that it impacts them in any way in their current situation
