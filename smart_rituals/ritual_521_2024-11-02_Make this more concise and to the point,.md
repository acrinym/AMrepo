Full text from "Aether" video

“Aether is the material supposed to fill the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere.  In mythology, it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the air breathed by mortals”.  (From Wikipedia)

“Aether”, the “5th element”, means the water that connects everything eletromagnetically.

The pseudoscience calls Aether as “dark energy” and “dark matter”.

I
Intro  
 
All cities located at strategic points on Earth along canals, rivers, seas, lakes and oceans were Star Fortress and had electromagnetic energy extracted from the ether. 

The energy was captured through towers and obelisks and stored in the red and white striped power stations of the High Civilization latelly called Great Tartaria. They always had a water fountain nearby.

This civilization was destroyed in the 19-20 century through floods, energy weapons (DEW) and scheduled mass exterminations and the Earth was suddenly deserted by billions of people. All the architecture and technology of this superior civilization was stolen and passed into the hands of Parasites who created the current ignorant civilization.

This is the story of how a visit to the Berlin Zoo led to the discovery that its magical atmosphere is inherited from the Star Fortress that housed the city and how all world architecture to this date is designed to extract electromagnetic energy from the ether.

 
II
Berlin Zoo 
 
On the cloudy afternoon of June, 28,  Natasha visited the Berlin Zoological Garden and realized there were something different in the air. 

Then she saw minarets of a mosque and imagined if it were harvesting electromagnetic energy from the aether. It was in that building that giraffes lived and they seemed very healthy - even joyful. So she wondered what could make Berlin's Zoo atmosphere so special. And she wished to come back to breathe that air again.

Would be Berlin associated with the recent past of the Tartar Aryan (Tartaria) Civilization, inherited from the legendary Titans from Hyperborea? In this civilization, architecture had the function of extracting waves and resonances from the electromagnetic field, to harmonize, heal, prolong life and increase the stature of men, plants and animals.

When the Earth's energy grid was destroyed by the barbarians who came from the "Terra Incognita" - the barbarians self called ‘the elected’ and ‘gods’ of Olympus -  the density crushed the Titans and threw them into the hell of Tartarus - the name given by “scholars” to the burning Tartaria.
 
And so the knowledge and the History of the Tartar Aryan Civilization was
burned out and erased from the memory of Humanity.
 

III
Victory Column
 
The Berlin Zoo gathers the most expressive collection of animal and vegetable species from around the world. There are 1,380 species, 20,200 animals and an Aquarium, surrounded by 35 hectares of vegetation. 

The Zoo is within the Tiergarten park, situated opposite the Reichstag dome and has in its center the Victory Column, in granite studded with bronze ornaments. Large domes, towers and columns are always associated with ether energy production.

This is the top of the coil inside the Reichstag dome, protected by mirrors. The tip of the coil seems to have been made with the purest copper and is in the hall below the mirrored part. Its shape copy the top of the old Power Plants of the East. But this is little to explain the happiness that reigns in the park and throughout the city.  

There is a more powerful reason. Berlin was one of the gigantic Star Fortress of the Ancient and Highly Advanced Civilization known as Great Tartaria. This 1688 engraving shows that Berlin was a huge and mighty Star Fortress.
 
This kind of fortress was not built by normal men. It would require thousands of highly skilled men. And there were such strongholds all over the earth. In addition, the fortress "communicated" with each other to create the worldwide energy grid. 
 
When the Parasites Invaders from Terra Incognita destroyed our ancient perfect electromagnetic grid and created cataclysms, the Old Civilization was annihilated and all its defensive structures wrecked or were melted and petrified.

Star Fortress provided security, health and harmony for its inhabitants.

Is it possible that some of the old magic is still present in the Berlin atmosphere  as in these 1896-1899 postcards ?  

At the Berlin Zoo, visitors and animals are also given the benefit of the magic sound of the old bells.
 
In the park there is a rare carillon installed at 42 meters high which houses 68 bells of 48 tons and is the fourth in the world in number of bells. Concerts in the park with the historic carillon take place every Sunday at 3 p.m., from May to September. The vibration of bronze, associated with the ethereal electromagnetic current, has a high harmonizing and healing power.
 
IV
Hohenzollern
 
The carillon history dates back to the first kings of Prussia, Frederick I and II, of the Hohenzollern dynasty. 
 
Wikipedia claims that the German zoo was "opened" in 1844 but on this date Germany did not exist and much less had central government. There was only one confederation with 22 small monarchies and 17 other states that spoke German.
 
The Tiergarten park and its palace belonged to the Tartary civilization. With the defeat of Tartary and the creation of Germany, the palace was demolished and the Reichstag was erected by the will of the character "Bismarck".

It is likely that Tartaria has designated Berlin Tiergarten to save almost extinct species, in a world that slowly came out of total chaos and sudden climate change. Janey Benson's observation of the numbered trees in Berlin Tiergarten park fits into this hypothesis.

Tiergarten may have been a magnificent Noah's Ark endowed with atmospheric energy, where all species were classified to be saved.
 
The building surrounded by eight minarets that Natasha saw in the Tiergarten and to which she ascribes the secret of such happiness, continues to secretly store atmospheric energy produced by Victory Column, associated with the Reichstag dome.
 
And what happens today in the central park of Berlin for the benefit of humans and animals, was carried out in the past throughout the world from the beginning of our Real History.

V
Iron and Copper

The high civilization Tartar Aryan extracted electromagnetic energy from the ether through star fortress complexes with power stations, domes, towers, minarets, bridges and obelisks and used the very high thermal and electrical conductivity of copper.

From 7,000 years ago to the 1900s, Tartarian people mined Keweenaw copper at Michigan, US, to provide raw material for domes and coils throughout the world. Its fusion with tin created the bronze that allowed primitive Europe to enter into the modernity that had existed for a long time in territories of Tartaria.

From the half of the 1900s, the ”Grey Men" would sent their agents to exterminate Tartarians in "New India" (North America), take their land and minerals and slaughter them and their livestock to feed the newly created industries of Chicago and transport the meat on the roads which would pave the way for the takeover of new territories and create distances that would encourage the oil industry, the use of the automobile and the need for currency expansion and creation of a financial system. But this is another story. 

Copper has been mined since the beginning of human history. Finish-Venetian people ("Phoenicians") mined copper in New World (America) and Cornwall. Copper ingots used in the Middle East and Europe complex were mined and molted in facilities in the Americas.

According to American Indian oral tradition, copper was mined by “red haired white-skinned ‘marine men’ who came from across the sea”. And mines of Almaden in Spain, Huancavelica in Peru and New Almaden in California, provided the mercury.

Wikipedia:  “The earliest substantiated and dated evidence of metalworking in the Americas was the processing of copper in Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan. Copper was hammered until brittle then heated so it could be worked some more. This technology is dated to about 4000-5000 BCE. Ancient civilisations knew of seven metals: Iron, Tin, Lead, Copper, Mercury, Silver and Gold.

In the past, “alchemists developed sophisticated, powerful techniques to separate and purify metals” (Wikipedia)

Copper and tin was used extensively, even in helmets, to power plasma (DEW) weapons and to obtain wireless communication.

And iron foundries were the backbone of the world industry until they disappeared in the Great Catastrophe.

VI
Coils
 
The electromagnetic energy was extracted and stored in toroid coils at the power plant summits, covered with copper, positioned below the towers.

When rotating inside coils, magnetic fields create electrical charges in a mercury vortex. Hindu energetic complexes exhibit this function at the top of their structures. “In a coil of multiple turns of wire, the magnetic field of the turns adds in the center of the coil, creating a strong field”, says Wikipedia.

"Coils" can still be seen at the top of the power supply centers in India. Manufactured History and the Invented Religions call these energy factories as ”temples."

Prambanan complex in Indonesia had originally 240 Power Stations in a concentric mandala layout
 
Power plants have metal hoops where the "toroidal coil" works. Perhaps the "mass dumper" of the Taipei Tower accumulates this function. Modern towers are already built with the domes themselves and they are positioned below the pole that stands up to contact with the ether. A lookout can distract visitors' attention on the tower's true architectural significance.
 
This metal sphere represents the favorite geometric object of the fictional character “Tesla”, reports Wikipedia. And so it is displayed in a museum in Belgrade with the ashes of the pseudo-inventor. The dark eminences that created the Tesla myth as well as a long list of many other, see themselves as very intelligent and with a great sense of humor.  And they appreciate leaving some clues of their frauds in the most unforeseen places.

The star fortress in Haiti, Taj Mahal, Hagia Sofia, Pantheon or Tower of Jewels were production plants and distribution of atmospheric energy, as well as thousands of “cathedrals”, “temples” and palaces around the world.

The original pyramids of Egypt and other places may have played an even more important role in electromagnetic energy production and for this they were the first to be neutralized.
 
Ancient pyramids and star fortress were so strong and powerful that many needed to be submerged like the Buhen fortress in Egypt, currently at the bottom of Nassar Lake, in one of the largest floods ever made in the world (1958). Next to it was an old copper factory and a city with 100 thousand inhabitants.
 
Pyramid-shaped power stations were called "tombs of pharaohs" and covered by sand, water, ice or vegetation such as the pyramids of the Faroe Islands, Antarctica, Bosnia, Russia and China.
 

VII
Skyscrapers

But this is the past. Today the atmospheric energy is extracted by skyscrapers like the Petronas, Taipei, Burj Khalifa, by towers on top of hills, roofs of buildings or through ”Radio and TV broadcast towers" such as Ostankino Tower, Oriental Pearl, Jin Mao, Shanghai or Tianjin. And this energy is no longer free or clean, besides being expensive.

Skyscrapers are modern power plants and work in conjunction with metal structures of bridges whose iron is in contact with water and has spheres that may contain minicoils and mercury in the upper part.

The Empire State and the Manhattan Bridge were built by the Tartarians long before 1900. Just like the Tour Eiffel. By 1953, at least, the Invading Parasites had built nothing in cities around the world. Just destroyed. All buildings erected until the 1950’s belong to the Tartary civilization. It was only from the 1960’s that poor and ugly buildings-crates of the new civilization would begin to be erected.

Photographs that purport to show the construction of the Empire State Building are false and are nothing more than photomontages overlapping high quality glass negatives with photos of some wood boards and false workers in the foreground.
 
Skyscrapers are modern powerhouses. When Tartarian plans to erect the Empire State Building began to be drawn, the goal was to capture enough energy to illuminate Lake Ontario, Vermont, Buffalo, Albany, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. This objective is registered on the aluminum plate in the hall of the building built by the Tartary civilization.
 
In the Chrysler building, Wikipedia expressly points out to 16 points on the 24th floor, which it calls "pineapples", where the mercury would be stored.

Buildings built by Tartaria around the world continue to draw atmospheric energy to the invaders until today.

Invaders copied old technology, such as this recent Las Vegas building whose dome produces power to 4,000 apartments and to a fountain with dancing waters, synchronized with lights and music.

Tartaria's Power Plants and other buildings were built in granite and geopolymer concrete since they become more resistant with the passage of time and has the superconducting quartz crystal in its composition.
 
Here are some power station domes working associated with obelisks, minarets and pinnacles in granite and geopolymeric concrete, with columns and ornaments in iron, for extraction of electromagnetic energy.
 
Electromagnetism produces gigantic invisible "waves" of energy. Transmitting towers receive and emit the electric field to considerable distances.
 
To transmit wireless electricity as in the past, to more and more extensive regions and with more users, the towers are getting higher.
 
Towers like these can extract atmospheric energy to feed entire countries.
 
It is possible that one of the reasons for the WTC's demolition in 9/11 was the need to expand energy extraction technology. 

Everyone remembers the huge antenna needle on top of one of the towers being sprayed into the air. WTC towers were obsolete and so they fell to the ground. The demolition dust caused 70,000 cases of cancer. Insurers paid $ 4.55 billion for the old towers' pulverization.  The new antenna looks much more powerful.

“An electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a coil, spiral or helix. Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field, or conversely an external time-varying magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an EMF (voltage) in the conductor”.  (Wikipedia)

VIII
Energy worldwide

All over the world the technology of energy extraction through the atmosphere still works perfectly in castles, buildings, palaces, greenhouses, lighthouses, kiosks, fountains, “mosques”, fortresses, towers, bridges and “cathedrals” that kept the old technological apparatus intact.

This apparatus includes elaborate roof grids and small window-like openings, metal ornaments in the corners of buildings, pointed antennae with ornaments or balls with mercury, metals embedded in masonry and geopolymer concrete, jars containing mercury, cornices, spires, roofs with copper ornaments and structural foundations in iron, among others.

This apparatus is also present in the current skyscrapers.

IX
The Architecture to extract energy

The world architecture for electromagnetic energy extraction derives entirely from the High Civilization Tartar Aryan. It is characterized by the use of arch openings, columns, domes and towers.  In addition to details such as rose windows and muqarnas, symbols of the vibration of electromagnetic energy, which acts on molecules and changes the behavior of cells.

Formerly these waves could act in healing, levitation and transport, besides provoking feelings like harmony and euphoria. This energy can now being used in another way.

The architecture of the Tartaria undergoes slight modifications and influences according to the local characteristics of climate, culture and material resources but maintains the basic principles throughout the world.

The Fake History called the Ancient architecture as ”Moorish revival” or “Mauresque” and “Islamic”. And also “Colonial”, “Medieval”, “Neoclassical”, “Baroque”, “Romanesque”, “Gothic”, “Beaux Arts”, “Eclectic”, “Tudor”, “Renaissance”, “Palladian”, “Richardsonian Romanesque”, “Chicago School” or “Victorian”. And labeled them as fashionable styles, to hide the old and true function of its columns, arched openings, pinnacles, rose windows, naves ornamented with iron columns, towers, and domes.

In addition to having cut the ends of the pinnacles in the photographs or add crosses that did not exist before.

X
War

After the Tartarian defeat, all the ancient buildings "destroyed by wars" were miraculously "rebuilt" from the years "1870s" by nonexistent architects whose portraits are a pastiche.

Fantasies like "was destroyed by fire in 1895 and rebuilt in 1901" are written to hide the advanced and superior technology present in the constructions of Tartary long before the 9th century.

Some wars, bombings, or great fires of the past may be historical falsehoods, repeated in 3 different layers like 1776, 1812 and 1870s. In Dresden, for example, there would have been a battle in 1813, revolts that damaged the city in 1848 and 1863, and severe bombing in February 1945. According to Official History, 90% of the city center was destroyed.  But this is not entirely true. The main buildings of the old citadel were spared.

There was a selective bombing that targeted residential dwellings as well as factories and military facilities. Dresden was a huge Star Fortress and capital of the Free State of Saxony, which did not obey to the “Pope” and to the new emperors.

The region had been entirely colonized by Aryan and housed over 600,000 war refugees whom the Invaders had an interest in exterminating. Dresden was an important economic center, with 127 factories and military facilities that could house 20,000 people.

The city's skyline continues exactly as it was in the 1800s and probably still draws energy from the ether. But the ancient inhabitants were gone to give place to the invaders.

This building in Dresden, for example, is a huge Tartarian power station, transformed into a mosque by Grey Men acting on behalf of Invading Parasites. Even so, it still retains the red and white colors of Tartary that designated the main function of these structures.

Tartaria knew that his enemy was ruthless and terrible and for this they protected their cities throughout the world with immense Star Fortress and great walls. But it was defeated by energy weapons (DEW) and waves of 300 meters of glacial waters that swept the continents and submerged the fortresses.

The enemy was stronger and could have simply destroyed the entire Earth. But he only wanted to exterminate billions of humans to take ownership of his lands, technology, fortunes, and palaces.

The architecture of Tartaria used the red color of bricks and clear stripes, to designate power stations and associated structures. Like the station of St Pancras in London, which belonged to the civilization of Tartary and by it was built.

In some regions they could also be striped in black, green or brown. And have a bronze griffin on the roof, the animal symb
