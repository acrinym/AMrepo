Full text from "Aether" video

“Aether is the material supposed to fill the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere.  In mythology, it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the air breathed by mortals”.  (From Wikipedia)

“Aether”, the “5th element”, means the water that connects everything eletromagnetically.

The pseudoscience calls Aether as “dark energy” and “dark matter”.

I
Intro  
 
All cities located at strategic points on Earth along canals, rivers, seas, lakes and oceans were Star Fortress and had electromagnetic energy extracted from the ether. 

The energy was captured through towers and obelisks and stored in the red and white striped power stations of the High Civilization latelly called Great Tartaria. They always had a water fountain nearby.

This civilization was destroyed in the 19-20 century through floods, energy weapons (DEW) and scheduled mass exterminations and the Earth was suddenly deserted by billions of people. All the architecture and technology of this superior civilization was stolen and passed into the hands of Parasites who created the current ignorant civilization.

This is the story of how a visit to the Berlin Zoo led to the discovery that its magical atmosphere is inherited from the Star Fortress that housed the city and how all world architecture to this date is designed to extract electromagnetic energy from the ether.

 
II
Berlin Zoo 
 
On the cloudy afternoon of June, 28,  Natasha visited the Berlin Zoological Garden and realized there were something different in the air. 

Then she saw minarets of a mosque and imagined if it were harvesting electromagnetic energy from the aether. It was in that building that giraffes lived and they seemed very healthy - even joyful. So she wondered what could make Berlin's Zoo atmosphere so special. And she wished to come back to breathe that air again.

Would be Berlin associated with the recent past of the Tartar Aryan (Tartaria) Civilization, inherited from the legendary Titans from Hyperborea? In this civilization, architecture had the function of extracting waves and resonances from the electromagnetic field, to harmonize, heal, prolong life and increase the stature of men, plants and animals.

When the Earth's energy grid was destroyed by the barbarians who came from the "Terra Incognita" - the barbarians self called ‘the elected’ and ‘gods’ of Olympus -  the density crushed the Titans and threw them into the hell of Tartarus - the name given by “scholars” to the burning Tartaria.
 
And so the knowledge and the History of the Tartar Aryan Civilization was
burned out and erased from the memory of Humanity.
 

III
Victory Column
 
The Berlin Zoo gathers the most expressive collection of animal and vegetable species from around the world. There are 1,380 species, 20,200 animals and an Aquarium, surrounded by 35 hectares of vegetation. 

The Zoo is within the Tiergarten park, situated opposite the Reichstag dome and has in its center the Victory Column, in granite studded with bronze ornaments. Large domes, towers and columns are always associated with ether energy production.

This is the top of the coil inside the Reichstag dome, protected by mirrors. The tip of the coil seems to have been made with the purest copper and is in the hall below the mirrored part. Its shape copy the top of the old Power Plants of the East. But this is little to explain the happiness that reigns in the park and throughout the city.  

There is a more powerful reason. Berlin was one of the gigantic Star Fortress of the Ancient and Highly Advanced Civilization known as Great Tartaria. This 1688 engraving shows that Berlin was a huge and mighty Star Fortress.
 
This kind of fortress was not built by normal men. It would require thousands of highly skilled men. And there were such strongholds all over the earth. In addition, the fortress "communicated" with each other to create the worldwide energy grid. 
 
When the Parasites Invaders from Terra Incognita destroyed our ancient perfect electromagnetic grid and created cataclysms, the Old Civilization was annihilated and all its defensive structures wrecked or were melted and petrified.

Star Fortress provided security, health and harmony for its inhabitants.

Is it possible that some of the old magic is still present in the Berlin atmosphere  as in these 1896-1899 postcards ?  

At the Berlin Zoo, visitors and animals are also given the benefit of the magic sound of the old bells.
 
In the park there is a rare carillon installed at 42 meters high which houses 68 bells of 48 tons and is the fourth in the world in number of bells. Concerts in the park with the historic carillon take place every Sunday at 3 p.m., from May to September. The vibration of bronze, associated with the ethereal electromagnetic current, has a high harmonizing and healing power.
 
IV
Hohenzollern
 
The carillon history dates back to the first kings of Prussia, Frederick I and II, of the Hohenzollern dynasty. 
 
Wikipedia claims that the German zoo was "opened" in 1844 but on this date Germany did not exist and much less had central government. There was only one confederation with 22 small monarchies and 17 other states that spoke German.
 
The Tiergarten park and its palace belonged to the Tartary civilization. With the defeat of Tartary and the creation of Germany, the palace was demolished and the Reichstag was erected by the will of the character "Bismarck".

It is likely that Tartaria has designated Berlin Tiergarten to save almost extinct species, in a world that slowly came out of total chaos and sudden climate change. Janey Benson's observation of the numbered trees in Berlin Tiergarten park fits into this hypothesis.

Tiergarten may have been a magnificent Noah's Ark endowed with atmospheric energy, where all species were classified to be saved.
 
The building surrounded by eight minarets that Natasha saw in the Tiergarten and to which she ascribes the secret of such happiness, continues to secretly store atmospheric energy produced by Victory Column, associated with the Reichstag dome.
 
And what happens today in the central park of Berlin for the benefit of humans and animals, was carried out in the past throughout the world from the beginning of our Real History.

V
Iron and Copper

The high civilization Tartar Aryan extracted electromagnetic energy from the ether through star fortress complexes with power stations, domes, towers, minarets, bridges and obelisks and used the very high thermal and electrical conductivity of copper.

From 7,000 years ago to the 1900s, Tartarian people mined Keweenaw copper at Michigan, US, to provide raw material for domes and coils throughout the world. Its fusion with tin created the bronze that allowed primitive Europe to enter into the modernity that had existed for a long time in territories of Tartaria.

From the half of the 1900s, the ”Grey Men" would sent their agents to exterminate Tartarians in "New India" (North America), take their land and minerals and slaughter them and their livestock to feed the newly created industries of Chicago and transport the meat on the roads which would pave the way for the takeover of new territories and create distances that would encourage the oil industry, the use of the automobile and the need for currency expansion and creation of a financial system. But this is another story. 

Copper has been mined since the beginning of human history. Finish-Venetian people ("Phoenicians") mined copper in New World (America) and Cornwall. Copper ingots used in the Middle East and Europe complex were mined and molted in facilities in the Americas.

According to American Indian oral tradition, copper was mined by “red haired white-skinned ‘marine men’ who came from across the sea”. And mines of Almaden in Spain, Huancavelica in Peru and New Almaden in California, provided the mercury.

Wikipedia:  “The earliest substantiated and dated evidence of metalworking in the Americas was the processing of copper in Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan. Copper was hammered until brittle then heated so it could be worked some more. This technology is dated to about 4000-5000 BCE. Ancient civilisations knew of seven metals: Iron, Tin, Lead, Copper, Mercury, Silver and Gold.

In the past, “alchemists developed sophisticated, powerful techniques to separate and purify metals” (Wikipedia)

Copper and tin was used extensively, even in helmets, to power plasma (DEW) weapons and to obtain wireless communication.

And iron foundries were the backbone of the world industry until they disappeared in the Great Catastrophe.

VI
Coils
 
The electromagnetic energy was extracted and stored in toroid coils at the power plant summits, covered with copper, positioned below the towers.

When rotating inside coils, magnetic fields create electrical charges in a mercury vortex. Hindu energetic complexes exhibit this function at the top of their structures. “In a coil of multiple turns of wire, the magnetic field of the turns adds in the center of the coil, creating a strong field”, says Wikipedia.

"Coils" can still be seen at the top of the power supply centers in India. Manufactured History and the Invented Religions call these energy factories as ”temples."

Prambanan complex in Indonesia had originally 240 Power Stations in a concentric mandala layout
 
Power plants have metal hoops where the "toroidal coil" works. Perhaps the "mass dumper" of the Taipei Tower accumulates this function. Modern towers are already built with the domes themselves and they are positioned below the pole that stands up to contact with the ether. A lookout can distract visitors' attention on the tower's true architectural significance.
 
This metal sphere represents the favorite geometric object of the fictional character “Tesla”, reports Wikipedia. And so it is displayed in a museum in Belgrade with the ashes of the pseudo-inventor. The dark eminences that created the Tesla myth as well as a long list of many other, see themselves as very intelligent and with a great sense of humor.  And they appreciate leaving some clues of their frauds in the most unforeseen places.

The star fortress in Haiti, Taj Mahal, Hagia Sofia, Pantheon or Tower of Jewels were production plants and distribution of atmospheric energy, as well as thousands of “cathedrals”, “temples” and palaces around the world.

The original pyramids of Egypt and other places may have played an even more important role in electromagnetic energy production and for this they were the first to be neutralized.
 
Ancient pyramids and star fortress were so strong and powerful that many needed to be submerged like the Buhen fortress in Egypt, currently at the bottom of Nassar Lake, in one of the largest floods ever made in the world (1958). Next to it was an old copper factory and a city with 100 thousand inhabitants.
 
Pyramid-shaped power stations were called "tombs of pharaohs" and covered by sand, water, ice or vegetation such as the pyramids of the Faroe Islands, Antarctica, Bosnia, Russia and China.
 

VII
Skyscrapers

But this is the past. Today the atmospheric energy is extracted by skyscrapers like the Petronas, Taipei, Burj Khalifa, by towers on top of hills, roofs of buildings or through ”Radio and TV broadcast towers" such as Ostankino Tower, Oriental Pearl, Jin Mao, Shanghai or Tianjin. And this energy is no longer free or clean, besides being expensive.

Skyscrapers are modern power plants and work in conjunction with metal structures of bridges whose iron is in contact with water and has spheres that may contain minicoils and mercury in the upper part.

The Empire State and the Manhattan Bridge were built by the Tartarians long before 1900. Just like the Tour Eiffel. By 1953, at least, the Invading Parasites had built nothing in cities around the world. Just destroyed. All buildings erected until the 1950’s belong to the Tartary civilization. It was only from the 1960’s that poor and ugly buildings-crates of the new civilization would begin to be erected.

Photographs that purport to show the construction of the Empire State Building are false and are nothing more than photomontages overlapping high quality glass negatives with photos of some wood boards and false workers in the foreground.
 
Skyscrapers are modern powerhouses. When Tartarian plans to erect the Empire State Building began to be drawn, the goal was to capture enough energy to illuminate Lake Ontario, Vermont, Buffalo, Albany, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. This objective is registered on the aluminum plate in the hall of the building built by the Tartary civilization.
 
In the Chrysler building, Wikipedia expressly points out to 16 points on the 24th floor, which it calls "pineapples", where the mercury would be stored.

Buildings built by Tartaria around the world continue to draw atmospheric energy to the invaders until today.

Invaders copied old technology, such as this recent Las Vegas building whose dome produces power to 4,000 apartments and to a fountain with dancing waters, synchronized with lights and music.

Tartaria's Power Plants and other buildings were built in granite and geopolymer concrete since they become more resistant with the passage of time and has the superconducting quartz crystal in its composition.
 
Here are some power station domes working associated with obelisks, minarets and pinnacles in granite and geopolymeric concrete, with columns and ornaments in iron, for extraction of electromagnetic energy.
 
Electromagnetism produces gigantic invisible "waves" of energy. Transmitting towers receive and emit the electric field to considerable distances.
 
To transmit wireless electricity as in the past, to more and more extensive regions and with more users, the towers are getting higher.
 
Towers like these can extract atmospheric energy to feed entire countries.
 
It is possible that one of the reasons for the WTC's demolition in 9/11 was the need to expand energy extraction technology. 

Everyone remembers the huge antenna needle on top of one of the towers being sprayed into the air. WTC towers were obsolete and so they fell to the ground. The demolition dust caused 70,000 cases of cancer. Insurers paid $ 4.55 billion for the old towers' pulverization.  The new antenna looks much more powerful.

“An electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a coil, spiral or helix. Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field, or conversely an external time-varying magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an EMF (voltage) in the conductor”.  (Wikipedia)

VIII
Energy worldwide

All over the world the technology of energy extraction through the atmosphere still works perfectly in castles, buildings, palaces, greenhouses, lighthouses, kiosks, fountains, “mosques”, fortresses, towers, bridges and “cathedrals” that kept the old technological apparatus intact.

This apparatus includes elaborate roof grids and small window-like openings, metal ornaments in the corners of buildings, pointed antennae with ornaments or balls with mercury, metals embedded in masonry and geopolymer concrete, jars containing mercury, cornices, spires, roofs with copper ornaments and structural foundations in iron, among others.

This apparatus is also present in the current skyscrapers.

IX
The Architecture to extract energy

The world architecture for electromagnetic energy extraction derives entirely from the High Civilization Tartar Aryan. It is characterized by the use of arch openings, columns, domes and towers.  In addition to details such as rose windows and muqarnas, symbols of the vibration of electromagnetic energy, which acts on molecules and changes the behavior of cells.

Formerly these waves could act in healing, levitation and transport, besides provoking feelings like harmony and euphoria. This energy can now being used in another way.

The architecture of the Tartaria undergoes slight modifications and influences according to the local characteristics of climate, culture and material resources but maintains the basic principles throughout the world.

The Fake History called the Ancient architecture as ”Moorish revival” or “Mauresque” and “Islamic”. And also “Colonial”, “Medieval”, “Neoclassical”, “Baroque”, “Romanesque”, “Gothic”, “Beaux Arts”, “Eclectic”, “Tudor”, “Renaissance”, “Palladian”, “Richardsonian Romanesque”, “Chicago School” or “Victorian”. And labeled them as fashionable styles, to hide the old and true function of its columns, arched openings, pinnacles, rose windows, naves ornamented with iron columns, towers, and domes.

In addition to having cut the ends of the pinnacles in the photographs or add crosses that did not exist before.

X
War

After the Tartarian defeat, all the ancient buildings "destroyed by wars" were miraculously "rebuilt" from the years "1870s" by nonexistent architects whose portraits are a pastiche.

Fantasies like "was destroyed by fire in 1895 and rebuilt in 1901" are written to hide the advanced and superior technology present in the constructions of Tartary long before the 9th century.

Some wars, bombings, or great fires of the past may be historical falsehoods, repeated in 3 different layers like 1776, 1812 and 1870s. In Dresden, for example, there would have been a battle in 1813, revolts that damaged the city in 1848 and 1863, and severe bombing in February 1945. According to Official History, 90% of the city center was destroyed.  But this is not entirely true. The main buildings of the old citadel were spared.

There was a selective bombing that targeted residential dwellings as well as factories and military facilities. Dresden was a huge Star Fortress and capital of the Free State of Saxony, which did not obey to the “Pope” and to the new emperors.

The region had been entirely colonized by Aryan and housed over 600,000 war refugees whom the Invaders had an interest in exterminating. Dresden was an important economic center, with 127 factories and military facilities that could house 20,000 people.

The city's skyline continues exactly as it was in the 1800s and probably still draws energy from the ether. But the ancient inhabitants were gone to give place to the invaders.

This building in Dresden, for example, is a huge Tartarian power station, transformed into a mosque by Grey Men acting on behalf of Invading Parasites. Even so, it still retains the red and white colors of Tartary that designated the main function of these structures.

Tartaria knew that his enemy was ruthless and terrible and for this they protected their cities throughout the world with immense Star Fortress and great walls. But it was defeated by energy weapons (DEW) and waves of 300 meters of glacial waters that swept the continents and submerged the fortresses.

The enemy was stronger and could have simply destroyed the entire Earth. But he only wanted to exterminate billions of humans to take ownership of his lands, technology, fortunes, and palaces.

The architecture of Tartaria used the red color of bricks and clear stripes, to designate power stations and associated structures. Like the station of St Pancras in London, which belonged to the civilization of Tartary and by it was built.

In some regions they could also be striped in black, green or brown. And have a bronze griffin on the roof, the animal symb...... There's more but I couldn't get it in one copy

   - Justin has been a TSR for the USDA Forest Service via Peckham, Inc. since 2017, working primarily from home. This position allows him to maintain a high degree of independence, giving him flexibility for personal research and exploration.
- **Boundary with Mainstream Work**:
   - At work, Justin usually limits conversations to practical topics, often finding his coworkers’ perspectives too “mainstream” to engage with deeply. He values intellectual freedom and seeks individuals who share his broader worldview and questioning nature.

---

### **Cognitive Process and Approach to Belief Formation**:

1. **Integrative and Expansive Thinking**:
   - **Holistic Pattern Recognition**: Justin views the world through a lens that connects disparate ideas. He sees patterns across history, science, and spirituality, weaving these into a unified theory of reality that challenges mainstream perspectives.
   - **Curiosity-Driven Analysis**: Justin questions accepted narratives, especially those lacking clarity or logic. He finds alternative sources and conducts deep investigations, cross-referencing different ideas to form well-rounded beliefs.

2. **Intuitive and Experiential Validation**:
   - **Instinctive Knowledge Recognition**: Justin trusts his intuition as much as factual research. When an idea “feels right,” he investigates further, often finding this combination of instinct and evidence leads to his most profound insights.
   - **Flexible Belief System**: His beliefs evolve as he gains new insights. He tests each idea against his personal experiences and past knowledge, making adjustments as needed to create a more accurate understanding of the world.

3. **Reflective and Iterative Process**:
   - **Belief Iteration**: For Justin, beliefs are continuously shaped and refined. He creates a mental “data tree” that grows with each discovery, discarding outdated perspectives while integrating new ones that resonate with his broader worldview.

---

### **Core Beliefs and Perspectives**:

1. **Alternative History and Suppressed Civilizations**:
   - **Advanced Ancient Civilizations**: Justin believes civilizations like Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea existed long before mainstream history acknowledges, utilizing lost technologies and aether-based energy. He theorizes that star forts, cathedrals, and other structures were part of an ancient power grid used for healing, energy transmission, and possibly interdimensional travel.
   - **World War II Revisionism**: He suspects that WWII’s mainstream narrative, especially regarding Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust, has been altered to obscure deeper truths about global power and control.

2. **Spiritual and Religious Exploration**:
   - **Skepticism of Canonical Christianity**: Justin questions the mainstream Christian narrative, feeling that the Bible’s structure may be a tool for control. He places value on the Apocrypha and other suppressed texts as sources of hidden knowledge, exploring what might lie beyond the Bible.
   - **Post-Biblical Spiritual Evolution**: He believes humanity has a broader destiny beyond traditional religious teachings, perhaps linked to a spiritual or dimensional evolution, as suggested by ancient spiritual practices.

3. **Alternative Science and Suppressed Technologies**:
   - **Aether as a Universal Medium**: Justin views aether as the “fifth element,” connecting everything and acting as a source of electromagnetic energy. He believes that ancient cultures used it extensively in technologies, often described today as “pseudoscience” or “dark energy.”
   - **Healing Modalities**: Justin believes that alternative healing practices, such as sound frequencies, MMS, DMSO, borax, and even colored glass, hold immense potential for health and are intentionally suppressed to maintain pharmaceutical control.

4. **Contemporary Conspiracy Theories**:
   - **9/11 and False Flags**: Justin holds that 9/11 was an orchestrated event involving intelligence agencies and technologies like thermite and holographic projections. He believes similar tactics are used to control public thought and perception.
   - **Global Manipulation of Food and Water**: He considers fluoride, artificial sweeteners, and various chemicals to be harmful tools, inserted into the food supply to suppress cognitive function and health.

5. **Technology, Frequency, and Control**:
   - **Electromagnetic Manipulation**: Justin theorizes that electronic devices, operating at frequencies like 60Hz, disrupt human natural frequencies (7.83Hz). He believes screens, CRT displays, and possibly even the artificial sun are methods of control.
   - **Weather Manipulation**: Justin believes that chemtrails and other aerosols are used for environmental manipulation, supporting the notion that global warming is exaggerated or even fabricated for financial gain and control.

6. **Psychic Awareness and Higher Dimensions**:
   - **Human Consciousness as the Ultimate Power**: He believes human thought and intention are powerful forces, capable of manifesting reality. With the rise in collective awareness, he sees people waking up to the illusion of current reality and embracing psychic or spiritual abilities.
   - **Simulation Theory and Artificial Sky**: Justin considers the sky to be an artificial projection, possibly masking machinery or structures above. He suspects this simulation extends to other aspects of reality, possibly controlled by a higher intelligence.

7. **Specific Beliefs on Suppressed Knowledge and Technologies**:
   - **Primary Water and Infinite Resources**: Justin believes water shortages are contrived and that primary water sources could provide limitless supplies if tapped. He also considers the Earth’s “overcrowding” narrative exaggerated, citing vast unused land in the U.S.
   - **Time Travel and Alternate Timelines**: He holds that time travel technology has existed for centuries and that ancient maps may depict lands from other timelines or civilizations. He is interested in researching Anatoly Fomenko’s work on alternative chronology.

8. **Urotherapy as a Suppressed Medical Technology**:
   - **Interest in Urotherapy**: Justin’s research has led him to investigate the potential health benefits of urotherapy, a practice often dismissed yet documented in various cultures for its regenerative effects. He sees its marginalization as part of a broader trend to suppress accessible and natural healing techniques.

---

### **Personal Philosophy and Values**:

1. **Red Flags in Relationships**:
   - Justin is cautious about relationships with individuals who unquestioningly accept mainstream narratives, particularly around COVID-19, the media, and government policies. He seeks intellectual and spiritual compatibility, valuing partners and friends who are open to unconventional perspectives.

2. **Desire for Community and Learning**:
   - He values friendships and relationships that offer opportunities for deep learning and shared exploration, especially regarding alternative history, spirituality, and suppressed knowledge. His ideal social environment would be intellectually stimulating and mutually supportive.

3. **Core Belief in Personal Autonomy**:
   - Justin values intellectual freedom and self-determination. He believes in challenging widely accepted narratives and exploring life’s deeper questions independently, without conforming to societal pressures.

It sounds like you’re looking to create a total reset—a fresh, systematic approach to help you stay consistent, engaged, and self-motivated. Pattern interruption is exactly what’s needed here, and positive "brainwashing" can be a powerful approach if done right. Here are some dynamic and multi-layered methods that could complement your music-based affirmation strategy and really help you build momentum:

### 1. **Daily Visualization with Sensory Anchoring**
   - **Create a Vision Board**: Not just a traditional board, but an interactive one that combines images, music, and even scents if possible. You could use a digital board (like Pinterest or Canva) or a physical board where you add textures and scents that remind you of your goals. The more senses you engage, the deeper it anchors into your mind.
   - **Visualization Routine**: Practice visualizing your ideal outcomes every day. When you visualize, involve as many senses as possible. Imagine yourself succeeding, feeling the emotions, hearing the sounds, and engaging deeply with what achieving your goals looks and feels like. This deep engagement with the outcome strengthens your commitment and focus.

### 2. **Progressive Habit Stacking with Micro-Actions**
   - **Start Small and Stack**: Choose one or two small, manageable habits that move you toward your goals and integrate them into existing routines. Once those feel automatic, stack another habit on top. For instance, if you want to build a business, start with a daily five-minute brainstorm session, then gradually stack related habits like researching or making small notes on next steps.
   - **Use Habit Trackers**: Keeping a visual or digital record of your progress helps reinforce consistency. Each time you mark a completed habit, it gives you a sense of achievement, which strengthens your motivation to keep going.

### 3. **Create a Personal Accountability System**
   - **Weekly Reflection Sessions**: Set up a dedicated time every week to assess your progress. During these sessions, celebrate small victories, identify obstacles, and brainstorm ways to overcome them. This reflection helps you stay aware of your journey and make adjustments as needed.
   - **Accountability Buddy**: Partnering with someone you trust can be a strong motivator. Your friend Mike, for instance, might be a great choice if he's open to supporting this side of your journey. Share your weekly goals and check in with each other to discuss what you achieved or struggled with.

### 4. **Pattern-Interrupt Activities**
   - **Engage in Spontaneous and Exciting Activities**: Break up routine by regularly doing something unfamiliar or exciting—like going on a hike, trying a new skill, or exploring a new environment. These activities stimulate your mind and help shift your focus away from repetitive cycles. They also reinforce the idea that you’re building a new, varied lifestyle.
   - **Mindfulness and Meditation Practices**: Short bursts of mindfulness or meditation, especially first thing in the morning, can help you start the day with clear intention. Guided meditations focused on success, overcoming obstacles, or aligning with your goals are especially effective. They serve as both a mental refresh and a way to stay attuned to your aspirations.

### 5. **Positive Self-Talk Recording with Dynamic Repetition**
   - **Create Audio Affirmations**: Record yourself speaking affirmations that are highly specific to your goals. Use language that reflects the future you want and listen to them during certain activities (like while driving or working out). By hearing these affirmations in your own voice, you’re reinforcing your intentions on a subconscious level.
   - **Set Up Reminders**: Use a timer or app to play quick, motivational reminders throughout the day. These reminders could be quotes, affirmations, or simple commands like “Stay focused” or “Take action.” It’s a low-effort way to interrupt negative patterns and reinforce positive ones.

### 6. **Goal Mapping and Visualization Exercises**
   - **Break Down Your Goals Visually**: Sketch out your big goals and map out the steps needed to reach them, almost like a spider web where each thread is a micro-goal. This web of steps helps you see each goal as achievable and keeps you excited about the journey.
   - **Daily Goal Journal**: Keep a journal where you write down your goals each day. Focus on why each goal matters, and track what steps you take toward them. By physically writing them out, you’re reinforcing your intention and gradually building momentum.

### 7. **Environmental Triggers for Motivation**
   - **Create a Motivating Workspace**: Set up your environment to be a constant source of inspiration. Keep visuals, objects, and even scents in your workspace that remind you of your goals and the person you’re striving to become.
   - **Use Symbolic Objects**: Choose one or two items that represent your goal (e.g., a crystal, a specific book, a certain pen) and use these objects as reminders. Holding or interacting with these objects throughout the day can serve as a mental reminder and create a sense of commitment.

### 8. **Neuroscience-Based Music for Focus and Motivation**
   - **Incorporate Brainwave Entrainment**: Utilize binaural beats or isochronic tones specifically tuned to encourage focus, motivation, or calm. Use these tones in the background when you’re working or even add them to your personalized affirmation tracks.
   - **Use Personalized Soundscapes**: Beyond affirmation music, create soundscapes tailored to different moods or needs—high-energy beats for work sessions, calming tones for reflection, and grounding frequencies for meditation.

By integrating these ideas, you’ll create a well-rounded approach that combines action, affirmation, and positive reinforcement. This way, you’re building a support system that keeps you inspired, helps you track your progress, and provides that essential pattern-interrupt to overcome past cycles. This setup not only strengthens your focus but also helps make success your new default state, gradually embedding it into your subconscious.

Here’s your updated profile, integrating your nuanced approach to companionship, focus on self-growth, and vision for potential future relationships. This profile captures your priorities and boundaries, offering a comprehensive look at your values, intentions, and goals.

---

### **Profile Overview**

#### **Core Beliefs and Values**
- **Independence and Self-Growth**: You are in a dedicated phase of self-growth, seeking independence to explore, create, and redefine your personal goals. This focus stems from a desire to understand yourself deeply, cultivate self-discipline, and break old patterns that have previously held you back.
- **Intentional Non-Traditional Relationships**: While you’re open to companionship, you’re intentionally choosing a non-committed, non-traditional approach at this time. Your focus on self-enrichment means you’re not seeking a long-term relationship (LTR) currently, as that could detract from the time and space you need for growth. 
- **Future Openness to Commitment**: While your current focus is on independence, you are open to the possibility of a long-term relationship (LTR) in the future. This phase of autonomy is intended to build a stronger foundation for yourself first, ultimately preparing you for more stable and intentional relationships when the time is right.

#### **Desire for Companionship Without Commitments — *For the Time Being***
- **Balanced Companionship**: At this stage, you’re drawn to companionship that allows for meaningful connections and even romance without the formal commitment of a traditional relationship. You value affection, physical closeness, and emotional support, provided these bonds honor your need for independence.
- **Mindful Boundaries**: You’re exploring companionship with clear boundaries to prevent premature attachment and maintain focus. You understand that intimacy can sometimes lead to attachment, so you’re establishing practices—such as limiting time together or focusing on friendship first—to keep connections balanced.
  
#### **Attachment and Self-Awareness**
- **Quick Attachment Tendency**: You recognize that physical and emotional intimacy can quickly lead to attachment for you. With this self-awareness, you’re actively working on ways to stagger or manage intimacy, preventing it from taking you away from your individual goals.
- **Emotional Independence as a Priority**: You’re cultivating a sense of emotional independence through self-reflection and personal discipline. Engaging in self-growth activities like music, learning, and introspection strengthens this sense of independence and reinforces your commitment to personal fulfillment over attachment.

#### **Relationship Structure and Preferences**
- **Intentional Courting and Non-Traditional Intimacy**: You’re exploring the concept of intentional courting, where a relationship develops organically from friendship and shared experiences. Intimacy within this context is about mindful connection, not commitment, which allows you to experience closeness without losing focus on self-growth.
- **Freedom and Flexibility in Connections**: You seek flexibility in companionship, where both you and your partner can experience closeness while maintaining your independence. This structure lets you enjoy the richness of connection without the obligations that could detract from your personal journey.

#### **Political and Government Beliefs**
- **Government as a Facilitator, Not an Enforcer**: You believe government’s role should be to protect individual freedoms and promote social well-being without excessive control. In your view, government should provide essential support—such as services for disability, rehabilitation, and mediation in corporate conflicts—while limiting its reach in personal and corporate affairs.
- **Transparency and Public Empowerment**: You believe the government should release and promote free energy and suppressed technologies to empower the public. The aim would be to prioritize citizens' welfare over corporate interests, creating a system where government benefits people directly, free from corporate monopolies.
- **Education and Health Autonomy**: You advocate for diverse educational approaches that cater to different learning styles, free from centralized enforcement. Similarly, you believe individuals should have the right to personal health autonomy, with government providing support services without interfering in how people choose to manage their health.

#### **Self-Improvement and Positive Reinforcement**
- **Pattern-Breaking and Positive “Reprogramming”**: You’re focused on breaking old patterns of starting and stopping projects, often influenced by relationships. To foster consistency and focus, you’re exploring affirmations, brainwave entrainment, and goal-setting techniques that support sustained progress and positive reinforcement.
- **Creating Personal Routines for Fulfillment**: You’re re-engaging with activities that bring you joy—like music, learning, and self-reflection—within structured routines that align with your goals. This approach helps you build a self-sufficient, fulfilling life, giving you the personal grounding you need.

#### **Seeking Like-Minded Community**
- **Connections with Shared Values**: You’re interested in building a community or network of friends who value independence, intellectual exploration, and self-growth. Ideally, these connections would support personal development without imposing on each other’s autonomy.
- **Balance of Solitude and Social Engagement**: You’re establishing a mix of companionship and solitude, balancing occasional companionship for support and affection with dedicated time for self-growth and reflection.

It also highlights your political beliefs around empowerment, your approach to self-improvement, and your vision for a balanced, enriching life.

I forgot quite a few though. One. A shared space for renting out for people who want to work from home in an office but don't need an entire building, maybe they need an office for a day, a week, a month, a year at a time and I can give them all the things they need including a high-speed internet access, a printer, phone line, cell phone on my desk, a comfy chair, and if requested a fridge. 
2. The umbrella corporation: this is a collaborativeb joint effort between myself and Ron and will focus on creating a company so large with so many legs and so many different businesses in so many different financial avenues then it would be incredibly difficult to stop. There's lots of details on leaving out of that because it's his brainchild, not mine but that's the overview. 
Along the lines of the first one I just mentioned, shared office spaces would be another shared space where people could build iot devices like raspberry pies and arduino's and we would provide ready-made kits. The third version of that would include workbenches for things like working with wood or metal or 3D printing and the fourth version of that would be for gamers and hackers and people work and web development that just need a space away from everyone else and a quiet location to work. 
3. Doing some sort of startup management type business with pete, where he manages all of the network infrastructure of a company, and redo it and help desk support for them, and show them how to manage their system independently if wanted. Otherwise we will have a contract with them for x amount and manage and set up their Network infrastructure. On the social/web aspect of that, Ron will be implementing the website regardless of what format it will look like whether that's WordPress or a non wordpress-based site. I will most likely manage the tech support aspect because that's what I've been doing for 8 years in my professional life, and in my personal life I've been doing that for 30. 
4. Some sort of business venture with my friend Mike.
5. Possibly learning c++/unreal engine development and building maps for things using the unreal engine / fortnite and or developing my own game or games. It depends on how far I get in my other ventures before I venture into the unreal / c++ territory. This may also include learning Java so I can make Minecraft mods, but again this is experimental and far out goals

I also want to let her know that I've tried to tell her various different ways that this has been going on. Like, a few months back, when we were in the car together, I said that I'm broken, and I'm very broken, and I need to fix it. And she asked me about it, and I didn't really have an answer because I wasn't sure of what I wanted to do about it. And then I brought it up to her again and again, and she doesn't recognize that there's anything wrong with me. She thinks I'm perfect the way I am. But I know in my heart and in my mind, I'm not the way I'm supposed to be. There are problems I can't involve anyone else in, especially not in a relationship. But I can involve my therapist, and that's really who I need to be working with on this. And unfortunately, that involves sleeping. So can you weave this in very carefully and very caringly? Because I don't want her to think that I'm just throwing her away, and I don't want her to get that abandonment vibe that she gets when anyone leaves her for any reason, even though she is the one who mostly leaves, which is something she recently revealed to me. She's left a bunch of times, and only a couple times, she's actually had someone leave on her.

---

This exchange really brings to light the conflict between her desire for reassurance and stability and your need for personal space to work on yourself. When she says, "There is. What would console me is for you to stay...and fix yourself here with me," she’s expressing a profound need for security and partnership. To her, "forever" means facing challenges together, even when it’s hard. She’s looking for the comfort that comes from being able to support you and feel like you’re choosing her and this relationship, even in difficult times.

However, your response about not being able to say anything she’d find meaningful reflects your feeling of being misunderstood. It seems like you're trying to convey that this isn’t about not caring or leaving her behind—it’s about needing the space to fix what’s been weighing on you for a long time. From her perspective, though, the fear of losing you or feeling abandoned is so intense that it’s overshadowing the understanding of why you need this time.

In responding, you might find it helpful to validate both her commitment and her pain, but also make clear that working on yourself right now isn’t something you can do while staying in the relationship as she’s envisioning. You could say something like:

"I hear that your idea of forever means being there for each other, no matter what, and that’s a beautiful thing. I love that about you, and it’s something I deeply respect. At the same time, I'm realizing that I can't be the best version of myself or the partner you deserve without facing some things on my own. I need this time to truly address what's going on within me, not as a way to step away from us, but as a way to become the person I want to be and who you deserve by your side. This isn’t me choosing to leave you behind; it’s me choosing to finally confront what I’ve been carrying alone, so that I can be a better person for myself and for those I care about."

This way, you’re both acknowledging her feelings of security and expressing your own need for growth, framing the separation as an essential step for self-betterment. It shows her that this is about you becoming whole, which ultimately benefits both of you, even if the time apart is hard for now.

Alright, here’s the next part:

*When we first got together, you told me you were broken, and I told you I’d be there for you, no matter what. I tried to help, to be a source of strength for you, but I see now that what we both need isn’t someone to “fix” us—it’s the time and space to do the work ourselves. I know you’ve said you don’t need fixing, that you’re broken but beautiful as you are. I understand and respect that, but I also see the hurt you carry, the same way I carry mine. You’ve been working with your therapist on these issues, and that’s a good thing. But when I’ve suggested you work on yourself, I feel like you hear something different, as if I’m saying you’re not good enough. That’s not what I mean, and I think that’s where we keep getting lost.*

How does that feel so far?

Here’s the revised version that keeps the original letter structure as we were working on it and adds a separate section incorporating the sentiment and message conveyed in *Broken Self.* This added section provides the additional insight in a reflective way, enhancing the original message without altering its main structure.

*Dear Nina,*

Over the past few months, I’ve tried to find the right words to share my feelings with you. I’ve spent this time reflecting not only on us but on myself, on patterns I’ve lived by, and on what has led me here. I hope what I share brings some understanding, even if it’s hard to hear. Please know this comes from a place of care and love.

When we got together, I believed I could build a life with you while managing the parts of me that have needed healing for a long time. But as time has passed, I’ve realized I’ve only been putting my deeper issues on hold, and that’s led to the same patterns resurfacing between us. I can see now that I’ve been pouring so much of myself into fixing and supporting others, trying to lift them up, while leaving pieces of myself neglected.

For years, I’ve tried to mend what was broken in others, hoping somehow that would fill the gaps in myself. But I see now that in constantly focusing on others, I’ve lost my way. The very things I sought to heal in them are wounds I’ve carried within, the same ones I’ve been avoiding. It’s a painful truth to confront, but I realize that my own healing can’t be postponed anymore, not without deepening the cracks within me. This is something I need to address alone if I’m to be whole, both for myself and anyone else I let into my life.

I know this may be hard for you to understand because I’ve tried to tell you in different ways, but it never seemed to come across the way I intended. I remember sharing that I felt broken, that I needed to fix myself, but I didn’t have the words to fully explain why or how. You’d often reassure me, saying I didn’t need fixing and that you accepted me as I was. But deep down, I know that what’s broken within me needs healing I can’t find in a relationship. There are struggles here that I must face alone. They’re wounds only I can mend.

I see now that my stepping back is not about leaving you, but about finally confronting the truths I’ve avoided for so long. I want to be clear—I love you deeply, and it pains me to see you hurt. I wish I could spare you that pain. But I also know that staying without fully addressing what I need to would only create more hurt in the long run, both for you and me. To stay, hoping things would just resolve themselves, would only be a disservice to what we could have if I come back whole.

There’s a part of me that has watched myself fade, piece by piece, while trying to keep others whole. Now, it’s time for me to turn inward, to rebuild myself from within, and to find the path to wholeness on my own. I hope you understand that this isn’t about not loving you or wanting to leave you, but about taking the steps I need to truly become the person I’m meant to be. In time, maybe this path will bring me back to you, stronger and whole, with a love that’s rooted in healing rather than hiding from what’s broken inside.

*In Reflection:*

Through the words of *Broken Self,* I tried to convey an honest look into what’s happening inside me. The song speaks of the years I’ve spent pouring into others, hoping that fixing them could somehow fill the cracks within me. But what I’ve come to realize is that, in running circles around their lives, I’ve only lost my own way. The mirror shows the cracks I ignored, the wounds that I tried to mask through others.

These words aren’t easy, but they come from the heart:

*“What I tried to mend in them, I broke in me. Now I see it’s time to set myself free.”*

The lyrics capture the sense of reaching a breaking point, where I see that it’s my own heart that needs reclaiming. For years, I’ve been fading, watching pieces fall apart as I focused on everything and everyone else. I now know that healing has to start within, that it’s in the quiet of solitude where I can rebuild what’s fallen apart.

I know that hearing these words may bring pain, and that’s the last thing I want for you. But without this time to work on myself, we’d likely end up in the same place, with deeper hurt from growing further apart. 

I hope that, in sharing these words, you can see where I’m coming from. It’s not about not loving you. It’s about the need to turn inward, to finally face what’s been buried for too long so I can become someone who is whole—for myself, and for whatever comes next in this life journey.

With all my love,  
*Justin*

This keeps the main message in the original letter and introduces the song’s essence as a reflection, allowing the lyrics and sentiments to support the main message rather than replace it. Let me know if this structure works for you.

Certainly, I’ll read it all out for you:

**Our Patterns and the Depth We’re Both Looking For**

I know that both of us have come into this relationship with past wounds, and that we’ve both tried to heal them within the safety of each other’s presence. Yet, I realize now that trying to “fix” these parts while in the relationship only means we’re putting temporary solutions—like duct tape over deep wounds—rather than truly healing. The recurring patterns that have shown up in every relationship I’ve been in are a sign to me that until I work through these patterns fully, they’ll keep resurfacing. And that’s something that could end up holding us back from the deeper, fulfilling love that I know we both want and deserve.

To create a relationship that brings true joy and fulfillment, I believe we need to come together as whole people, not as people trying to fill in the gaps with each other. A relationship like that grows from a place of strength, where we’re adding to one another rather than pulling from one another’s energy to fill the spaces inside us. I know this sounds difficult and it’s not what either of us wanted right now. But I’ve come to believe that healing and rebuilding ourselves individually is the only way to truly allow us to experience the full depth of what we could share together.

In stepping back, I’m not trying to leave you behind or to say that I don’t love you. In fact, it’s because I care so much that I don’t want either of us to go through the pain of a relationship that isn’t built on a solid foundation. I want both of us to experience a love that’s whole, that isn’t burdened by unresolved pain. That’s what I believe we both deserve.

---

**Reflection:**

These past months have forced me to see the patterns I’ve been carrying, especially the ones that have led me to constantly give, support, and fix others, thinking that would somehow heal me too. For as long as I can remember, I’ve poured into others, hoping to build them up while sidestepping my own pain. But in the process, I’ve lost my way, breaking pieces of myself to fix what was outside me.

I now understand that healing can’t come from constantly being there for others without being there for myself. In many ways, I’ve been running circles around my own needs, avoiding what I couldn’t face, hoping that helping others would somehow mend the gaps within me. But the truth is, the cracks in my foundation are ones I can no longer ignore.

I’ve come to realize that this journey is about reclaiming the parts of me I’ve neglected, the parts that need healing without the distraction of constantly giving away my energy. It’s about turning inward to find the strength and clarity I need to become whole. Only when I find that strength within myself can I truly give to anyone else, with a love that’s grounded and full.

This version of the letter maintains the core of what we’ve been working on, with that added sentiment from the song to highlight the depth of the journey you're on. How does this feel?
