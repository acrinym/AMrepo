## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Sure, here are the final lyrics:

---

**Verse 1:**  
The screaming echoes of what once appeared,  
The fading silence of a life I held so dear.  
Distant memories, a past that didn’t last,  
How can I be so designed, to be resigned to thoughts that clash?

**Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.

**Verse 2:**  
Fading, the future, my mind inside creates,  
Abating, the ebb and flow of precious fates.  
How do I forge a life from endless strife,  
When the discord lingers, cutting like a knife?

**Bridge:**  
I wish I could go back and undo the past,  
Relive the beauty, make the moments last.  
But trauma’s scars are deep, they never heal,  
The past was but a dream, never real,  
And the future remains a veil unmasked.

**Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.

**Outro:**  
The echoes fade, yet shadows remain,  
A symphony of sorrow, intertwined with pain.  
In darkest nights, where all seems dead,  
I’ll rise above where others dread.  
The storm may rage, but I stand tall,  
From the ashes, stronger, I’ll recall.

Certainly! To reach around 3,000 characters, I’ll expand on the existing lyrics by adding more verses, repeating the chorus, and extending the bridge and outro slightly, while maintaining the theme and structure. Here’s the expanded version:

---

**Verse 1:**  
The screaming echoes of what once appeared,  
The fading silence of a life I held so dear.  
Distant memories, a past that didn’t last,  
How can I be so designed, to be resigned to thoughts that clash?

**Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.

**Verse 2:**  
Fading, the future, my mind inside creates,  
Abating, the ebb and flow of precious fates.  
How do I forge a life from endless strife,  
When the discord lingers, cutting like a knife?

**Bridge:**  
I wish I could go back and undo the past,  
Relive the beauty, make the moments last.  
But trauma’s scars are deep, they never heal,  
The past was but a dream, never real,  
And the future remains a veil unmasked.

**Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.

**Verse 3:**  
The echoes linger, haunting every breath,  
A dance with shadows, flirting close with death.  
In the stillness, the truth begins to fray,  
How do I escape this never-ending gray?

**Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.

**Bridge 2:**  
The storms that rage, they seek to pull me under,  
But in the chaos, I hear a distant thunder.  
A call to rise above the noise and pain,  
To find the light, to break the chain.

**Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.

**Outro:**  
The echoes fade, yet shadows remain,  
A symphony of sorrow, intertwined with pain.  
In darkest nights, where all seems dead,  
I’ll rise above where others dread.  
The storm may rage, but I stand tall,  
From the ashes, stronger, I’ll recall.

**Final Chorus:**  
I cannot scream, my words, they don’t appear,  
I hold it in, the thoughts you cannot hear.  
Fading whispers from a time long past,  
A future’s spell that I’ve uncast,  
But I cannot allow these thoughts to persevere.
