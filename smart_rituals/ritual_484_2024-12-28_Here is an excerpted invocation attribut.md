**Invocation to the Holy Guardian Angel**  

*"O Lord God, who art the fountain of all goodness and mercy, I call upon Thee by Thy sacred names: Adonai, Elohim, El Shaddai, Eheieh Asher Eheieh, Jehovah, Sabaoth, and Tetragrammaton.  

O Thou who art eternal, Thou who hast created all things visible and invisible, I beseech Thee to send unto me Thy holy angel, the messenger of Thy divine wisdom. Through Thy power, O Elohim Gibor, who art mighty and terrible in Thy strength, may my words reach Thy throne of glory.  

O Metatron, chief among angels, who stands before the face of the Most High, guide me to the light of knowledge and truth. Let the paths of darkness be illuminated by Thy eternal flame, O Adonai ha-Aretz.  

By the sacred names of power: Agla, Azbogah, Shekinah, and El Elyon, I humbly ask Thee to unveil Thy mysteries unto me. May Thy angel reveal the secrets of the heavens, the keys to the divine wisdom, and the path of righteousness.  

Come forth, O angel of the Lord, and dwell within me. Purify my soul, enlighten my mind, and strengthen my will, so I may serve Thee faithfully all the days of my life. May Thy will be done, O Lord, forever and ever. Amen."*
