A black screen after logging into Windows can be caused by various issues, including driver problems, corrupted system files, or conflicts with startup programs. Here are several troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue:

### Initial Steps

1. **Restart the Computer**: Sometimes, a simple restart can fix temporary glitches. Since you mentioned the "slide to shutdown" screen appears when you hit the power button, try shutting down completely and then restarting.

2. **Safe Mode**: Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists. Safe Mode loads only the essential drivers and services.
   - Restart your computer and press `F8` or `Shift + F8` before Windows starts to load.
   - Select `Safe Mode` or `Safe Mode with Networking` from the menu.
   - If the black screen does not appear in Safe Mode, it indicates a driver or startup program issue.

### In Safe Mode

1. **Update Graphics Drivers**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Device Manager`.
   - Expand the `Display adapters` section, right-click your graphics driver, and select `Update driver`.

2. **Disable Startup Programs**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
   - Go to the `Startup` tab and disable all non-essential startup programs.
   - Restart the computer and see if the issue is resolved.

3. **Run System File Checker**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter.
   - Let the system scan and repair any corrupted files.

### Additional Steps

1. **Perform a Clean Boot**:
   - In Safe Mode, press `Win + R`, type `msconfig`, and press Enter.
   - Go to the `Services` tab, check `Hide all Microsoft services`, and click `Disable all`.
   - Go to the `Startup` tab and click `Open Task Manager`.
   - Disable all startup items.
   - Restart your computer normally to see if the issue is resolved.

2. **Check for Malware**:
   - In Safe Mode with Networking, download and run a reputable antivirus or anti-malware tool to scan your system.

3. **Reset Display Settings**:
   - Press `Win + Ctrl + Shift + B` to reset the display driver. This can sometimes bring the screen back.

### If None of the Above Work

1. **System Restore**:
   - Boot into Safe Mode.
   - Press `Win + S`, type `System Restore`, and select `Create a restore point`.
   - Click `System Restore` and follow the prompts to restore your system to a previous point when it was working fine.

2. **Repair Installation**:
   - If you have a Windows installation media, boot from it and select `Repair your computer`.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to repair your Windows installation.

3. **Reinstall Windows**:
   - As a last resort, you can perform a clean installation of Windows. Ensure you back up your data before proceeding.

### Preventive Measures

- **Keep Drivers Updated**: Regularly update your drivers, especially graphics drivers.
- **Regular System Maintenance**: Run regular system scans and keep your system clean from malware and unnecessary startup programs.
- **Backup Important Data**: Regularly back up your important data to avoid data loss in case of system issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the black screen issue after login. If the problem persists, it might be hardware-related, and you may need to consult a professional technician.
