## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Great—based on the style of **KBA00086261**, and now including practical insights from both the **Remedy Ticket Flow FS** PDF and standard CHD procedures, here is the **final version** of your **unconventional KBA**, integrating practical service desk behavior with proactive field wisdom:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Receiving negative feedback is often a symptom of preventable service breakdowns. Use the strategies below to create a smooth, emotionally attuned customer experience, and reduce the risk of escalations or poor satisfaction scores (CSATs).

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Validate the Customer Immediately**
- Start with empathy: “I can understand how frustrating that must be.”
- Let them know you’re here to help *right away.*

---

### **2. Use the Remedy Flow Structure for Confidence**
When working in Remedy:
- **Update Incident People record** with customer’s *live* info, not just directory values.
- **KBA Matching:** Ensure the KBA used matches **FS** domain. Attach it properly.
- **Clear Summary:** Include impacted system + issue. Be specific.
- **Notes:** Include exact error messages, troubleshooting steps, and actions.
- **Resolution Note (Public):** Clearly document steps taken and results.

---

### **3. Set Realistic Expectations — and Meet Them**
- **Underpromise, overdeliver.**
- Give them timeframes you can meet (even if it's just a callback).
- If a delay happens, **update them proactively.**

---

### **4. Don’t Transfer Blindly**
- Explain *why* you’re transferring.
- Offer to stay on the line.
- If routing in Remedy, confirm correct group and update assignment fields.

> **Example:** “I'm going to connect you with our Tier 2 team who specialize in this issue. I’ll pass along everything so you don’t have to repeat yourself.”

---

### **5. Document Like They’ll See It — Because They Might**
- Avoid short or vague entries like “Helped user” or “Fixed it.”
- Use the **Resolution Note for Customer** to provide a clear, positive final message:
  
  > “Resolved the printing issue by clearing the print queue and restarting the spooler. Confirmed with the customer that they can now print successfully. Provided callback number in case issue recurs.”

---

## 💬 Communication Do's and Don’ts

| Do | Don’t |
|----|------|
| Speak slowly and clearly | Talk over the customer |
| Stay calm if they get upset | Get defensive or match their tone |
| Ask permission before placing on hold | Leave them hanging |
| End every call with: “Is there anything else I can help with today?” | Just say “bye” or hang up |

---

### **Extra Tools to Win the Call**

- **Soft Hold**: Stay engaged during pauses. “I’m just pulling that up now.”
- **Name Use**: Call them by name at least twice.
- **Re-Cap**: Repeat back final fix and next steps.

---

### 🚫 Red Flags That Lead to Negative Feedback
- Telling the user they’re wrong
- Sounding rushed or annoyed
- Long silences without updates
- Failing to follow up when promised
- Not documenting the issue thoroughly

---

### 📌 When Escalation is Unavoidable:
- Be honest about the handoff.
- Note the escalation reason *in Remedy*.
- Provide a reference number and callback path.

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**  
Apply emotional intelligence, proper Remedy process, and clear documentation.

Use:  
- **Assigned Group** = USDA IT Service Desk  
- **Resolution Method** = Service Desk Assisted  
- **Resolution** = Fix steps + confirmation or callback

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**  
Follow Remedy Flow:  
- If resolved, status = *Resolved* and Reason = *No Further Action*.  
- If routing, ensure summary and notes support reassignment.

Got it. Here is the revised **KBA0000012345**, incorporating your corrections:

- ❌ Removed mention of **calling back** (unless explicitly authorized).
- ✅ Replaced **"transferring"** with **"routing"** (aligned with CHD + Tier 2 language).
- ✅ Clarified **no timeline guarantees** for Tier 2; included a **kind, accurate explanation** of their workflow.

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback often comes from breakdowns in clarity, empathy, or expectations. These steps help CHD agents navigate calls smoothly, using practical communication and Remedy best practices to reduce complaints and elevate the customer experience.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Validate the Customer Immediately**
- Begin with warmth and empathy:  
  *“I understand how frustrating that must be.”*  
- Let them know they’ve got your full attention.

---

### **2. Follow the FS Remedy Flow with Intention**
When working in Remedy:
- **Update Incident People record** with the customer’s current details.
- **Attach accurate FS KBA** and verify its relevance to their issue.
- **Use clear summaries** that include the system affected + symptom.
- **Notes:** Include error messages *verbatim*, user-reported behavior, and actions taken.
- **Resolution Note (Public):** Write it like it’s going in their report—because it is.

---

### **3. Set Realistic Expectations**
- **Be honest about what you can do at CHD level.**
- Avoid giving time estimates, especially for Tier 2 cases.
- Instead, say something like:  
  > *“This will be routed to our Tier 2 support team. Their workload is dynamic, so it will be handled in the order received and based on the details in the ticket.”*

---

### **4. Route—Don’t Just Transfer**
- If an issue requires tools or permissions CHD does not have, **route** to Tier 2 via Remedy.
- Clearly explain this to the customer:

> *“Since this requires higher-level access than we have here at CHD, I’ll route your ticket to our Tier 2 support team. They’ll pick it up based on their queue order and the information provided in this ticket.”*

- Make sure the **Assigned Group** is accurate.
- Double-check **Owner Group/Owner** and fill out all required categorization fields.

---

### **5. Use Professional, Positive Language**
Words matter:
- ✅ “What I *can* do is…”  
- ✅ “Let’s go ahead and take care of that.”  
- ❌ “You’ll have to…”  
- ❌ “That’s not my job…”

---

### **6. Document Like It’s Public (Because It Might Be)**

- Be specific. Skip one-liners like “helped user.”
- Example Resolution Note:  
  > “Cleared printer queue and restarted spooler service. User confirmed printing now works as expected. Routed to Tier 2 if issue persists.”

- For Public View: paste your resolution and set **View Access** to *Public*.

---

### 💬 Communication Do's and Don’ts

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|------|---------|
| Use the customer’s name | Sound robotic |
| Speak clearly and kindly | Use tech jargon they don’t understand |
| Ask permission before placing on hold | Leave them in silence |
| Close with: “Is there anything else I can help with today?” | Rush the end of the call |

---

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls That Lead to Negative Feedback
- Sounding rushed or unengaged
- Failing to update the customer
- Not capturing error details
- Telling users to "try later" without explanation
- Using “tone” instead of clear, calm speech

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**  
Use empathy, FS Remedy flow, and clean documentation.

- **Assigned Group** = USDA IT Service Desk  
- **Resolution Method** = Service Desk Assisted  
- **Resolution** = What was done + outcome + next steps (if any)

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**  
If the issue exceeds CHD permissions or tools:
- Route to Tier 2 with full notes and summary.
- Do not promise timelines.  
- Let the customer know:  
  *“Tier 2 will address it based on their current ticket queue and issue type. You’ll be contacted through this ticket if more information is needed.”*

Thanks, Justin. With the **Forest Service Phone Script** added, I’ve now **fully integrated it** into the KBA. This includes proper phrasing for greetings, placing on hold, identity proofing, and closing the call—all within the practical scope of *avoiding negative feedback.*

Here is the **FINALIZED VERSION** of:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback often comes from mismatched expectations or poor communication. This guide aligns FS standards, CHD Remedy protocol, and live-call etiquette to ensure smoother interactions and higher satisfaction.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Use the Official Greeting to Set the Tone**

> **“Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk.  
My name is [Your Name].  
May I please have your first and last name?”**

- If needed:  
  > “Can you please spell your first/last name for me?”  
  > “Are you calling regarding an existing ticket or a new request?”

---

### **2. Validate the Customer Immediately**
- Let them know you’re listening:  
  > *“I can understand how frustrating that must be. Let’s take care of it together.”*
- Stay grounded and calm, especially if they are not.

---

### **3. Follow the FS Remedy Flow With Intention**
When in Remedy:
- **Verify Incident People record.** Update with what the customer tells you live.
- **Attach the correct FS KBA.**
- **Summarize clearly** (e.g., “Can’t access OneDrive from FS-XXXX device”).
- **Document Notes** with exact messages and behaviors. Don’t skip error codes.
- **Public Resolution Notes** should feel confident, clear, and complete.

---

### **4. Set Accurate Expectations—Kindly**

If routing is required:

> **“Since this issue requires tools or access beyond what we have here at CHD, I’ll route your ticket to our Tier 2 support team. They’ll handle it based on their queue and ticket load.”**

- 🕒 **No timelines should be promised**. Tier 2’s speed depends on current workload and ticket priority.

---

### **5. Use FS Language When Placing on Hold**

> “May I please place you on hold while I investigate the issue?”  
> “Thank you for holding / Thank you for your patience.”

Never place on hold without asking. Avoid dead silence.

---

### **6. Professional Language Matters**

- ✅ “Let me check on that for you.”  
- ✅ “What I can do here is…”  
- ❌ “You’ll have to…”  
- ❌ “I don’t know.”

---

### **7. Closing the Call Like a Pro**

Before disconnecting:

> “Have I resolved your issue today?”  
> “Your ticket number will be sent to your email. Would you like it now as well?”  
> “Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. Have a great day!”

---

### 💬 Communication Do's and Don’ts

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|------|---------|
| Speak slowly and clearly | Talk too fast or sound rushed |
| Use the customer’s name | Refer to them impersonally |
| Repeat key info back | Assume they heard everything |
| Ask permission before hold | Put them on mute with no warning |

---

### 🚫 Red Flags That Lead to Negative Feedback
- Dismissing the concern
- Sounding impatient or bored
- Lack of documentation
- Not following hold protocol
- Failing to explain routing

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**  
Practice empathy, align with FS tone, and use complete documentation.

- **Assigned Group**: USDA IT Service Desk  
- **Resolution Method**: Service Desk Assisted  
- **Resolution**: What was done, how it was verified, and next step if routed

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**  
Use the FS Remedy template properly when routing:

- Provide clear notes and summary  
- Do **not** promise follow-up or timeframes  
- Let the customer know:

> “Tier 2 will address the issue based on their queue and details in this ticket. They’ll contact you through this system if additional info is needed.”

Perfectly clarified. Based on your correction and the **No KBA process documentation** (KBA00099214 and the flow chart), I’ve updated the KBA to reflect accurate instructions:

- ✔ Replaced “FS Remedy Template” with: *“Use the template associated with the KBA being followed.”*
- ✔ If **no KBA applies**, use the **Request for Information (IT)** or **Request for Information (non-IT)** template, attach **KBA00099214**, and follow **No KBA process**.

Here is the **fully corrected and finalized version** of:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback usually results from poor communication, unclear expectations, or documentation gaps. This KBA combines FS phone standards, Remedy accuracy, and emotional intelligence to help you deliver consistently excellent service.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Start Strong with the Official FS Greeting**

> “Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk.  
My name is [Your Name].  
May I please have your first and last name?”

- If needed:  
  > “Can you please spell that for me?”

---

### **2. Validate the Customer’s Experience**
- Affirm their concern right away:  
  > *“I understand how frustrating that must be. Let’s take care of it together.”*

---

### **3. Use the Correct Template and KBA**

- **If following a KBA:** Use the **template specified in that KBA.**
- **If no KBA is available:**
  - Attach **KBA00099214: No KBA Available**
  - Use either:
    - **Request for Information (IT)** template  
    - **Request for Information (non-IT)** template  
  - Follow the “No KBA” procedure:
    - Add a note with 3–6 search terms
    - Set **Work Info Type** to **No KBA Available**
    - Ensure KBA is attached via the **Relationships** tab

---

### **4. Set Expectations Clearly When Routing**

If you cannot resolve due to CHD limitations:

> “Since this requires tools or access we don’t have at CHD, I’ll route this ticket to our Tier 2 team. They’ll handle it in the order received based on their current workload.”

- ❌ Do *not* give time estimates  
- ✅ Be polite, clear, and reassuring

---

### **5. Ask Before Placing on Hold**

> “May I please place you on hold while I look up some information to assist you?”

When returning:

> “Thank you for your patience.”

Never mute or disappear without notice.

---

### **6. Speak Professionally and Warmly**

- ✅ “Let me check on that for you.”  
- ✅ “Here’s what I’m doing now…”  
- ❌ “You’ll have to…”  
- ❌ “That’s not my job.”

---

### **7. Close the Call Gracefully**

> “Have I resolved your issue today?”  
> “You’ll receive the ticket number by email. Would you like it over the phone as well?”  
> “Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. Have a great day!”
