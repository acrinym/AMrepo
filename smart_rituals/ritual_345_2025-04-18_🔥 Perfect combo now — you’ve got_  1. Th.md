## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

ðŸ”¥ Perfect combo now â€” youâ€™ve got:

1. The **chiral crystal blooms** (golden, jagged, hand-shaped) from the first image  
2. Sam holding the **crystal collector device** from the second image  
3. A clear vision: Sam collecting the glowing chiralium aftermath, possibly after a BT whale takedown  

Letâ€™s sculpt the **ultimate prompt for SORA or Gen-2 style video output**, as if itâ€™s a **cutscene from Kojima himself**:

### ðŸŽ¬ Scene Prompt: *Sam Collects Chiral Crystals*

> *A cinematic third-person tracking shot of Sam Porter Bridges in full gear, kneeling down in the rain to collect golden chiral crystals after a battle. The ground is wet, broken, and glowing with chiral energy. Using his **crystal collector device** â€” a small cylindrical tool with faint blue lights â€” Sam scans and retrieves one of the large, hand-shaped **chiralium spires** emerging from the earth. The crystals shimmer and dissolve into the device with a soft hum. His floating carrier hovers nearby, slightly tilting as it waits. Mama stands quietly in the background, watching the ritual. The scene is solemn, mystical, and electric with post-BT energy. Timefall rain continues to fall, distorting the golden glow across the battlefield. Ghostly echoes still hang in the mist.*

Want me to script out the actual **camera angles and cuts** too? (e.g., over-the-shoulder shot, close-up on collector, wide pan of crystals) â€” I can stage this like a short cinematic storyboard if you're planning to animate it or prompt SORA step-by-step.
