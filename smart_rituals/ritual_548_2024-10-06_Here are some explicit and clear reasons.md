## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Here are some explicit and clear reasons you can use to explain to a surface-level thinker why you need to be single right now. These explanations aim to be straightforward and easy to understand, avoiding deeper concepts or abstract ideas.

### 1. **I Need to Focus on Myself**
   - *Explanation:* I am not happy with where I am in my life, and I need to spend time working on myself without any distractions. Being in a relationship requires time, energy, and attention that I need to use for personal growth and self-improvement.

### 2. **I Don’t Have the Energy for a Relationship Right Now**
   - *Explanation:* Relationships need a lot of emotional energy to make them work, and right now, I don’t have enough energy to put into a relationship. It’s not fair to either of us if I can’t give you or the relationship the time and effort it needs.

### 3. **I Need Time to Understand What I Want in Life**
   - *Explanation:* I am at a point in my life where I need to figure out who I am and what I want for my future. To do this, I need space and time to think, without the pressure of being in a relationship. 

### 4. **I Feel Like I Am Losing Myself in a Relationship**
   - *Explanation:* When I am in a relationship, I tend to focus on the other person too much, and I forget about my own needs and desires. This makes it hard for me to be myself or work on my own goals, which I need to do right now.

### 5. **I Want to Build My Own Happiness First**
   - *Explanation:* It's important for me to learn how to be happy on my own before sharing that happiness with someone else. Right now, I need to work on finding my own happiness and feeling content with myself, without relying on a relationship to make me feel good.

### 6. **I Need Space to Figure Out My Emotions**
   - *Explanation:* There are a lot of feelings and thoughts I need to sort out for myself, and I can’t do that while being in a relationship. I need to be alone to fully understand my own emotions and work through any issues I have within myself.

### 7. **I Am Struggling to Balance My Life**
   - *Explanation:* Right now, I am struggling to balance all the different parts of my life. Work, personal goals, and self-care are things that I need to focus on, and being in a relationship makes it difficult for me to find that balance.

### 8. **I Don’t Want to Cause You Pain or Discomfort**
   - *Explanation:* Staying in a relationship when I am not able to fully be present or happy isn’t fair to you. I don’t want to drag you through something that will make either of us unhappy. It’s better for both of us if I am single and can deal with my own issues first.

### 9. **I Am Not Able to Grow in a Relationship Right Now**
   - *Explanation:* For me to grow as a person, I need to be on my own right now. Relationships can be great for some people, but right now, I need to be single so I can grow and improve without being held back by the responsibilities that come with being in a relationship.

### 10. **I Need to Find My Direction in Life**
   - *Explanation:* I am at a place in my life where I need to find out what direction I want to take. Being in a relationship makes it hard for me to fully focus on figuring out my path, as I feel responsible for thinking about “us” instead of just “me.”

### 11. **I Need to Break Patterns from My Past**
   - *Explanation:* I've noticed that I have certain patterns in relationships that aren’t healthy for me or my partner. To change these patterns, I need to spend time alone, reflect on them, and make sure I am ready for a healthy relationship in the future.

### 12. **I Don’t Want to Hold You Back**
   - *Explanation:* I feel that being in a relationship with me right now might hold you back from things you want to do or achieve. It's better for you to be free to live your life and pursue your goals without being tied down to someone who needs to figure things out for themselves.

Each of these points can be further simplified or modified to match Nina's level of understanding, and you can choose the ones that resonate most closely with your situation. This straightforward language aims to prevent misinterpretation and allows for a clear explanation of why you need to be single at this time.

It's understandable that while you're still living together, there's a bit of a limbo feeling to the situation. Here are some ideas for activities that allow you to spend time together without creating emotional closeness that might blur the boundaries you're trying to establish:

### 1. **Practical Home Activities**
   - *Explanation:* Work on small household tasks or projects together. For example, cleaning out shared spaces, organizing things for your move, or tackling small repairs. This keeps things practical and grounded in the reality of transitioning to separate lives.

### 2. **Casual Outdoor Walks**
   - *Explanation:* Going for a walk together in a neutral space like a park can be a simple way to interact without engaging in deep conversations. The fresh air and change of environment may help keep the focus light and friendly.

### 3. **Low-Key Movie Nights**
   - *Explanation:* Watch a lighthearted movie or show that you both enjoy, but make it more like two friends watching together rather than a couple’s night. Sit separately if that helps to keep a bit of space.

### 4. **Shared Meals with Clear Boundaries**
   - *Explanation:* Share meals, but keep the atmosphere relaxed and focused on eating and simple conversation. If cooking together has been an intimate activity for you, consider simpler or pre-prepared meals that don’t require too much collaboration.

### 5. **Playing Casual Board Games or Video Games**
   - *Explanation:* Engage in some friendly competition through board games or video games, but keep it light and fun without turning it into a "date night." Games are a great distraction and help maintain a more surface-level connection.

### 6. **Practical Discussions About Logistics**
   - *Explanation:* Spend time discussing logistics like how things will be managed during and after your move, without veering into emotional territory. This reinforces the understanding that the relationship is shifting to a more practical, transitional phase.

### 7. **Group Activities with Friends**
   - *Explanation:* Involve friends in your activities so that the focus is not on the two of you as a couple. This creates a different social dynamic, and it can help maintain a healthy distance while still allowing some shared experiences.

### 8. **Neutral Hobby Activities**
   - *Explanation:* If you both enjoy a neutral hobby, such as painting, gardening, or working on separate craft projects side by side, you can do these things together without making it feel like a shared, bonding experience.

### 9. **Running Errands Together (If Needed)**
   - *Explanation:* If there are errands that need to be done, like grocery shopping or picking up supplies, you could do them together in a purely practical manner. Keep the focus on completing the task rather than making it a fun outing.

### 10. **Simple Pet or Outdoor Care**
   - *Explanation:* If you have pets or a shared garden, tending to them together can be a good way to engage in something positive without getting into heavy discussions.

The key is to keep the activities low-pressure, practical, and focused on shared interests or neutral experiences that don’t invite emotional intimacy. This approach allows you to spend time together as you transition out of the relationship without crossing the lines of separation you're trying to establish.
