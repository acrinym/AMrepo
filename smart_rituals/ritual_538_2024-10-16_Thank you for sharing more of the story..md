## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Thank you for sharing more of the story. I'll incorporate the deeper context into the lyrics, focusing on the friendship you built during your time working together, his desire for healing, and the hope that seemed to be on the horizon. Here's an updated version of the song, reflecting these aspects.

**Song Title: "The Way Back Home"**

[Verse 1]  
*We met on the line, just voices in the static,*  
*Workin' side by side, dealin' with the frantic.*  
*You wore your past like a weight you couldn't hide,*  
*But man, you were tryin', reachin' for the light.*

*Gone for a while, put away to fight your pain,*  
*Came back hopin' things could never be the same.*  
*Therapy and faith, you were seekin' the road,*  
*Wantin' to lead, carryin' that heavy load.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, tryin' to release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you’d be alright.*  
*Now you're gone, but you're still in my heart,*  
*In every memory, in every restart.*

[Verse 2]  
*Back to church, you found some hope in the hymns,*  
*Talkin' 'bout redemption and a chance to begin.*  
*You said you wanted to be someone that could lead,*  
*We thought maybe, just maybe, you’d plant that seed.*

*But life is hard, and it takes its toll,*  
*Even the strong lose their hold on the soul.*  
*Today I heard, and it cut me deep,*  
*Jesse, you're free, but now I weep.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, tryin' to release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you’d be alright.*  
*Now you're gone, but you're still in my heart,*  
*In every memory, in every restart.*

[Bridge]  
*We all have demons, but you fought 'em with grace,*  
*Lookin' for salvation in every space.*  
*I’ll carry your story, your fight, your name,*  
*You’re still here, in every whispered refrain.*

[Outro]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, tryin' to release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you’d be alright.*  
*You may be gone, but you're not far away,*  
*Still walkin’ with me, in every day.*

I completely understand where you're coming from, and it's a great idea to honor that side of Jesse. It sounds like his work with JHUD Studios and creating plugins for FL Studio was a big part of his passion, even if it didn’t reach the level of success he hoped for. Including that part of him in the song could be a beautiful way to reflect the connection you two had over music and his dedication to his craft.

How about we weave in a reference to his work with JHUD Studios in a subtle but meaningful way? We could mention how he was always creating, working on something that mattered deeply to him, even when it was tough. We can emphasize that his music and plugins were a personal passion, something that kept him going, and how that work left a mark, even if others didn’t always see it.

What if the lyrics referenced how he was "building sounds" or "crafting tools for dreamers" to subtly bring in the plugin work? We could even mention how, despite the struggles, it was something that represented his creative spirit. This would let us highlight his love for music production in a way that both honors his efforts and keeps the tone positive and respectful for sharing with others.

What do you think about this direction? Would you prefer it to be a specific mention of JHUD Studios, or something more poetic to represent that side of him?
