**The Memorial for a Box of Mac and Cheese**

In the quiet town of Cheddar Falls, nestled between rolling hills and golden wheat fields, an unusual monument stands—a solemn, glass-encased pedestal at the center of Memorial Park. Beneath the crystal-clear casing rests an ordinary-looking box of mac and cheese. Its radiant orange label glows faintly under the gentle light of an eternal flame, as if lit by divine hands. The plaque below reads: *"For Eternium: In Unwavering Preservation."*

It all began twenty years ago, on a chilly November afternoon. Mrs. Edna Blumberg, an elderly widow with no children, discovered the box of mac and cheese while sorting through her pantry. Purchased during the infamous Great Cheese Shortage of '99, it was a box of rare provenance—made with "100% real powdered cheese" during the brief six-month period when the cheese-to-powder ratio was at its historical peak. The box had sat forgotten on the highest shelf, untouched and unspoiled, a testament to the resilience of processed food.

To Edna, it wasn’t just mac and cheese. It was a promise. A reminder that even in dark times—when cheddar rations were limited and mozzarella was but a myth—humanity could find comfort in the humble union of pasta and dehydrated dairy. She decided then and there that this box must never be opened, never boiled, and never consumed. It would instead become a symbol of perseverance.

News of Edna's discovery spread through the town, and soon, others began to rally around her cause. They donated funds, held spaghetti suppers, and staged the historic "March of the Elbows" to raise awareness of their mission. Through tireless effort, they built a climate-controlled glass chamber, ensuring the box would remain unscathed for all time, impervious to heat, humidity, or the rogue appetites of hungry midnight snackers.

The dedication ceremony drew thousands. Children brought macaroni art in tribute, the local choir sang *"Ode to the Orange Powder,"* and Mayor Clive Bottomsworth delivered a stirring eulogy:

*"Though this box may seem humble, it carries with it the weight of generations. Within its sturdy cardboard walls lies the hope of the hungry, the solace of the weary, and the joy of a perfectly creamy bite. Though it shall never meet boiling water nor taste of buttered spoons, its sacrifice will ensure that we remember the value of comfort in times of trial. Long may it sit, unboiled, unmixed, and unyielding to the cruel whims of time."*

Today, the Box Memorial is a pilgrimage site for mac and cheese enthusiasts worldwide. Visitors leave offerings of pasta shells, crumbled crackers, and tiny sachets of imitation powdered cheese in its shadow. Scholars debate its significance—some see it as a poignant statement on modern preservationism; others argue it is simply "a box in a park." Regardless, it inspires compassion, laughter, and a touch of disbelief in all who see it.

The box remains unscathed, untouched for eternium, its cardboard edges as crisp as the day Edna found it. A small sign nearby asks visitors not to tap the glass or lick it ("Yes, we know it looks delicious"). And as the town of Cheddar Falls gathers every November for its annual Powdered Cheese Vigil, they know that even in a world of impermanence, one thing will endure: the box, its powdered treasure, and the spirit it represents.
