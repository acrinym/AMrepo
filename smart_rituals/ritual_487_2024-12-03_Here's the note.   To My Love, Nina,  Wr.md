## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Here's the note. 

To My Love, Nina,

Writing this has not been easy, and I’ve thought long and hard about how to put my feelings into words. I hope you can read this with the care and love that I’ve poured into it, as every word comes from a place of respect for you and what we’ve shared.

From the moment we met, I wanted to create the best relationship I’d ever had. I believed that if I worked hard enough, we could build something extraordinary together. But over time, I’ve come to realize that the relationship of my dreams isn’t something that can be built within another relationship—it’s something I have to create first within myself.

When I came into this relationship, I was broken. I had just gone through a horrible experience with Amy, and I wasn’t in a place where I was whole or healed. You told me early on that you were “broken but beautiful,” and I understood that deeply. I admired your ability to embrace that part of yourself, and I tried with everything I had to hold you together, even when I needed time and space to heal myself. I thought that by being the driving force behind you, by showing extra affection and care, I could help make you feel whole. But over time, I began to realize that wholeness is something that can only come from within—not from an outside source, and certainly not from me.

I want to take a moment to reflect on something that’s stayed with me since the beginning of our time together—our day in Lakeview. It was one of the first times we spent the day truly alone, just exploring and enjoying each other’s company. We walked for miles, even through the rain, and shared so much of ourselves in that time. I’ll never forget when you played Tiësto’s 10:35 for me, and how perfectly it seemed to capture the moment we were in. At the end of the day, sitting in the car, I couldn’t help but cry because I saw how much it hurt you when I had to leave. Even though it was only for a short time, it reminded me how deeply you feel, how much you love, and how much you’re willing to give to someone you care about. It was such a beautiful, emotional moment that I’ll always treasure.

As I look back on that day and all the moments we’ve shared since, I realize how much effort we’ve both put into this relationship. I know this decision to leave is incredibly painful, and I’ve tried so hard to find ways to make it easier for both of us. I even considered the possibility of taking some time apart without fully leaving, but I could see that wasn’t something you were open to. I understand why—it’s hard to imagine being apart when you care so deeply. But I’ve reached a point where I know this step is necessary, not because of a lack of love, but because we both need space to heal and grow in ways we can’t do together.

This realization has made me confront something much deeper: a pattern that has followed me throughout my life—a failure archetype. In every relationship I’ve had, I’ve found myself falling into the same dynamic, where I try to hold everything together while neglecting my own needs and healing. Over time, the relationship becomes unsustainable, not because of one person’s actions, but because of this underlying pattern. I’ve envisioned this relationship failing in so many ways, and that’s not because of you—it’s because I haven’t yet done the work to break free of this cycle.

Nina, I love you very much. I know that by being apart, it’s the only way we can both truly work on ourselves. I don’t want to see you fail in your efforts, and I don’t want to fail in mine. I know that if I stay, the relationship will eventually break down because there is still so much we each need to work on individually. Despite your best efforts to change in these last weeks, which I’ve deeply noticed and appreciated, I know there’s a lot more that needs to be done behind the scenes—work we haven’t even been able to talk about yet because it runs so deep.

We’ve both experienced deeply traumatic situations in life. You’ve faced the devastating loss of your husband, Eli’s father, and the pain of past abuse and abandonment from the people in your life who should have cared for you most. I’ve faced my own trauma—the loss of my dad, my grandma, and the people who hurt me in so many ways, whether through abuse, abandonment, or harm. These wounds are profound, and they’ve shaped us both. But they also show us why healing is so essential, and why we can’t build a lasting relationship on top of broken pieces. I need to heal these parts of myself before I can truly be whole, and I believe the same is true for you.

I’ve noticed how much you’ve been working on yourself recently, and I’ve seen a beautiful side of you emerge. You’ve become more caring, more affectionate, and more attentive in ways that feel natural and unprompted. That means so much to me. It’s made these last weeks feel different, even special in a way, because I can see how much you’re trying. And while I genuinely appreciate all of it, it’s bittersweet for me because I know these changes came so late in our relationship. I wish they could have come sooner because they mean so much, but I also understand that this is part of your journey. Please know that your efforts have not gone unnoticed and that I admire the strength it’s taken for you to grow in these ways.

For much of my life, I’ve put my dreams and desires on hold, waiting for someone to share them with. I see now that I was looking outside myself for fulfillment, hoping to experience those dreams with a partner rather than experiencing them fully on my own. And while you’ve shown me in so many ways that you want to share life and grow and do all these things together, I also see now that it has to start with me. I need to live these experiences first before I can fully embrace them with someone else. Otherwise, I’m not bringing my whole self to the table—I’m taking from someone else’s energy to make my life feel complete, and that’s not fair to you or to me.

This isn’t about leaving you behind—it’s about taking a step back to grow into who I’m meant to be. I can’t do that while I’m in a relationship because I know myself too well. I give my all to my relationships, and while that’s a beautiful thing, it has often meant that I neglect my own growth in the process. I want to change that. I want to live fully, to experience my passions and dreams, and to build a life that feels complete on its own. Only then can I truly bring my best self into a partnership.

I hope this can also be a moment of reflection for you. You are an amazing person with so much potential, and I believe you have the strength to build the life you want as well. This isn’t the end of everything—it’s a chance for both of us to grow in ways we couldn’t while trying to make this work.

I’ll always treasure the time we’ve shared and the love we’ve given each other. I hope that someday, you’ll look back and see this moment not as a loss but as the beginning of something better for us both.

With love and sincerity,
Justin

**This is not goodbye forever.** My mom has told me to tell you that you are always welcome at family gatherings. She specifically asked that you join us at Christmas this year and wear the matching shirt she gave you because she loves having you around. You are part of the family, Nina, and that door will always stay open for you and Eli. Please don’t ever hesitate to reach out or come visit the family. You are loved and valued beyond this relationship, and nothing about that will change. 

Nina, I want to work on us, but I’ve realized there are so many things I need to work on for myself, by myself, before that can happen. This isn’t about leaving you or proving you’re not enough; it’s about breaking patterns and healing traumas that can only be addressed outside of a relationship. I carry a history of unresolved childhood trauma, loss, and a pattern of leaving relationships when things get difficult. I don’t want that to define me or the future relationships I build, including the one we could have if we are meant to reconnect. 

I know how deeply you feel abandonment because of your past, and I want you to know this isn’t about abandoning you. I care for you deeply and always will. This step isn’t about running away but about stepping back to create the healthiest version of myself—and I hope, in your own way, you’ll see this as an opportunity to do the same for yourself.

Thank you for everything we’ve shared and for all the love you’ve given me. I’ll always treasure you and hope this time apart brings healing and growth for both of us. 

With love and sincerity,  
Justin

This version integrates everything you requested while keeping the original context intact. Let me know if it aligns with your vision!

I hope she does see it somewhat at least in the way that I'm writing it because I've spent literally months writing the note and crafting in things that need to be said and things that she will hear and understand in the way that I want to say them. I don't think I've been in such a position before where I just walk out because it's not being understood then I need to do this for me. I have been in several other relationships where I needed to take time for myself outside of the relationship and never got that chance because there was no relationship after that. And then I just moved on to the next relationship without actually working on myself for very long. I know this could mean I never see Nina again together with her, but hopefully I still see her at events and things because she's really been a big part of my life possibly, very possibly saving my life which I tell her in the note I believe and if it's not there it needs to be. During the time with Amy and when I'm at her, she really brought light to a place that was completely loaded with darkness and I nearly took my life back then. I had nowhere to go, no one to turn to, and no way out. Then Nina showed up and really showed me there was another way and a way out and hope for the future. I had thought that all hope was lost. I was spending all my money on someone who did nothing to contribute and just it was a horrible time in my life as we highlight in the note already.

---

Absolutely, Justin. This "down-ish" feeling isn’t necessarily a bad thing—it’s likely part of the natural process of working through some very heavy and unresolved emotions. When you’re processing grief, loss, or deep emotional experiences like the ones tied to your children and your current situation, it’s normal to feel drained, subdued, or even disconnected for a time.

---

### **Why This Might Be Happening:**
1. **Emotional Release:**
   - Crying over BB’s theme and exploring darker creative outlets like the distorted lyrics could be ways your mind and heart are unpacking what you’ve been holding onto. This kind of emotional processing can leave you feeling temporarily "off" because it’s hard work for your psyche.

2. **Transitioning to Acceptance:**
   - Feeling down doesn’t mean you’re stuck—it might mean you’re moving through the stages of processing and acceptance. Sometimes this stage feels quieter, less intense than the initial waves of emotion, but it’s just as important.

3. **Emotional Exhaustion:**
   - When you’ve been carrying heavy emotions and actively engaging with them (through reflection, creativity, or even conversations like this), it’s natural to feel tired or low. It’s a sign that you’ve been doing the inner work and need to recharge.

---

### **Why It’s Not a Bad Thing:**
- **It’s Part of Healing:** Feeling low is often part of the process of releasing emotional weight. It’s your system recalibrating after carrying the burden for so long.
- **You’re Letting Yourself Feel:** By acknowledging and sitting with these emotions instead of burying them, you’re giving yourself permission to heal rather than avoiding the pain.
- **Growth Comes After This Stage:** This “down” period often clears the way for greater clarity, acceptance, and emotional strength once it passes.

---

### **How to Navigate This Feeling:**
1. **Be Gentle With Yourself:**
   - Allow yourself the space to feel without judgment. It’s okay to have lower-energy days or moments where things feel heavy. They’re temporary and part of the process.

2. **Balance Reflection With Action:**
   - While it’s good to reflect, try to balance it with small, positive actions—like working on a creative project, going for a walk, or engaging in something that gives you a sense of accomplishment or peace.

3. **Seek Comfort Without Pressure:**
   - Listen to music, write, or even revisit *Death Stranding* if it feels cathartic. Just ensure that what you engage with feels like it’s helping you process rather than pulling you further down.

4. **Look for Signs of Progress:**
   - Even small shifts, like feeling lighter after crying or gaining new insights through reflection, are signs that you’re moving forward. Celebrate those moments, even if they feel minor.

---

### **Final Thoughts:**
This down period isn’t a sign that something is wrong—it’s a signal that you’re processing something profound. It’s okay to feel this way, and it won’t last forever. Trust that by working through these feelings, you’re moving toward a better emotional space, even if it feels slow or murky right now.

If you need help navigating these emotions further or want to unpack them more, I’m here to support you. You’re doing the hard but important work of healing, and that’s a powerful step forward.

---

Here’s a comprehensive summary of what you’ve shared about the past few days, your actions, feelings, and the overarching situation. It’s written to give your therapist a clear understanding of what’s been happening and how you’re processing everything:

---

### **Summary of Recent Events and Emotional State**

Over the past few days, I’ve been navigating a complicated mix of emotions and actions tied to both my immediate circumstances and deeper unresolved feelings from my past. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve experienced and how I’ve been processing it:

---

#### **1. Actions and Creative Outlet**
- I’ve been channeling my emotions through creative work, particularly writing distorted and dark lyrics. This started as a playful activity but evolved into something much deeper:
  - I began distorting the lyrics into unrecognizable forms, eventually shifting from human speech sounds to inhuman, abstract, and demonic utterances.
  - I explored themes of satanic imagery and references to grimoires, laughing maniacally as I worked through these iterations.
- This process has been cathartic in a strange way—it’s allowed me to explore darker emotions that I don’t typically express. The laughter feels like a release, even though the themes are unsettling.
- The intensity of these creative outlets has continued, and today I began experimenting with alien languages, like the Covenant language from *Halo*. This progression feels like an extension of the same emotional processing I started earlier.

---

#### **2. Emotional Context**
- My emotional state feels “off” or dark—not my usual cheerful self. I’ve been experiencing:
  - Tiredness, frustration, and a sense of being overwhelmed, especially tied to my delayed plans to move out.
  - A persistent "manic-like" energy that’s not fleeting as it usually is. It feels prolonged and unusual for me.
- These feelings intensified when I listened to BB’s theme from *Death Stranding*. The music brought me to tears, triggering deep grief tied to personal losses:
  - The abortion of my first child by a past partner.
  - My concerns for my son’s future after receiving multiple COVID vaccinations, which I fear have compromised his long-term health.

---

#### **3. Delayed Move and Lingering Frustrations**
- My move-out timeline has been repeatedly delayed. Initially planned for December 2nd, then December 4th, it remains uncertain due to logistical challenges and waiting for an opportunity to leave while Nina is away.
- Nina’s recent actions have further complicated my emotions:
  - She has been making efforts to improve our dynamic, which feels like an attempt to remove reasons for me to leave. While well-meaning, this adds emotional weight to my decision, as my reasons for leaving are rooted in personal growth and breaking cycles, not her actions.
  - Her efforts, while appreciated, make me feel even more stuck because they unintentionally challenge the clarity of my decision.

---

#### **4. Reflections on My Current State**
- I feel like I’m in an emotional limbo:
  - I’m processing a mix of unresolved grief, frustration from my delayed move, and the weight of Nina’s response to my plans.
  - My creative outlets, while providing some relief, highlight the depth of these emotions. The dark themes I’m exploring reflect how unsettled I feel internally.
- This “down” feeling doesn’t feel catastrophic, but it’s significant. It feels like I’m on the edge of working through something important, yet stuck in the middle of the process. I recognize this might be a transitory emotional state, but it’s affecting my energy, mood, and focus.

---

### **What I’m Dealing With**
In summary, I’m navigating a combination of:
1. **Emotional Weight:**
   - Grief over past losses (my first child and concerns for my son).
   - Frustration and overwhelm from delays and disruptions to my plans.
   - A sense of being stuck between leaving and dealing with Nina’s responses to my plans.
2. **Creative Exploration:**
   - Using distorted, dark, and abstract creative outlets to process emotions.
   - Finding catharsis but also noticing how this reflects my current darker state of mind.
3. **Transition Delays:**
   - Feeling emotionally and logistically delayed in starting the next chapter of my life, which amplifies my frustration and sense of being stuck.
4. **Prolonged State of Uncertainty:**
   - A feeling of being in a “manic-like” state that’s uncharacteristically lasting longer than usual, combined with tiredness and emotional overwhelm.

---

### **Why I’m Sharing This**
I want to ensure you’re aware of what I’m experiencing, even if this is a temporary emotional "train wreck." These feelings, while unusual, are significant, and I want to make sure I’m addressing them with your guidance. I’m open to exploring what might be contributing to this and how I can navigate it more constructively.

---

Let me know if this captures everything you wanted to express, or if there’s anything else you’d like to add or adjust. It’s a lot to process, but you’re doing the right thing by sharing it with your therapist.

---

Here’s the revised section with your feedback incorporated. I’ve adjusted the tone to reflect your voice and included the idea of how your realization about wholeness came from your self-help studies:

---

When I came into this relationship, I was broken. I had just gone through a horrible experience with Amy, and I wasn’t in a place where I was whole or healed. You told me early on that you were “broken but beautiful,” and I got that. I saw the beauty in who you are, even in the midst of your brokenness. I know that brokenness came from being hurt over and over by different people, and it reflects the struggles you’ve been through. I tried with everything I could to help you during that time—to show you how beautiful you still are and to support you in any way I could. 

But over time, I began to realize that wholeness is something that can only come from within—not from an outside source, and certainly not from me. This was a hard lesson to learn, but through my own reading and studying of self-help materials, I started to understand that being whole means finding happiness and fulfillment within yourself first. It’s something I’ve been working on, and I’ve come to see how important it is for both of us to discover that individually before we can truly build something lasting together.

---

This revision ties in your self-help journey and reflects your voice while keeping the tone compassionate and relatable. Does this work for you, or would you like to adjust it further?

---

Thank you for sharing that, Justin. It adds depth to your self-awareness and goals for growth. This can be reflected in the note in a way that aligns with your personal journey while maintaining a compassionate tone toward Nina and her dreams. Here's a possible addition or adjustment:

---

I’ve always wanted to help kids who’ve been manipulated, traumatized, or taken advantage of—because I went through those same experiences as a child. It’s something I’ve carried with me for so long, and it’s shaped a lot of who I am today. But I’ve come to realize that I’m not in a place right now where I can pursue that kind of dream. The weight of my own trauma makes it difficult for me to step into those situations because I don’t yet have the mental tools to handle them in a way that would be healthy—for me or for the people I’d want to help. That’s a big part of why I’ve committed to my NLP, hypnotherapy, and life coaching program. I know I need to reprogram the trauma I’ve carried and learn how to navigate situations where people might try to manipulate or take advantage of me. It’s something I’m working on because I want to be better equipped than ever before, not just for myself but for the difference I hope to make in the future.

---

This addition ties your goals into the context of the note, showing how they relate to your decision to step away and focus on yourself. Does this align with how you’d like to express it?

---

Here’s the revised section incorporating your point about needing to first master these tools for yourself before applying them to others, especially in the context of working with teens:

---

I know you’ve thought about how I could use those tools to help the disadvantaged teens you hope to work with in your dream restaurant, and that’s such a thoughtful vision. But the truth is, without having gone through the training myself and using those tools in real-life applications, there’s no way I could even begin to deal with teenagers on that level. Heck, I still need to learn how to deal with adults in those kinds of situations before I could ever take on something as complex as working with troubled teens. That’s why I need this time and space to focus on myself—to ensure that I can develop those skills and tools fully before stepping into any role like that.  

---

This version acknowledges her vision while making it clear that you need time to focus on your own growth and skill-building first. Does this work for what you’re trying to express?

---

Here’s the revised section incorporating this additional context about your overwhelm, your goals with hypnotherapy and NLP, and your focus on ensuring your future success:

---

It’s something I’ve carried with me for so long, and it’s shaped a lot of who I am today. But I’ve come to realize that I’m not in a place right now where I can pursue that kind of dream.

Heck, I still need to learn how to deal with adults in those kinds of situations before I could ever take on something as complex as working with troubled teens.

That’s also part of why I feel so overwhelmed when trying to handle situations with Elijah. I’m not equipped with the tools a psychologist or psychotherapist has, and though I’m learning hypnotherapy, NLP, and life coaching, those tools aren’t designed for his current needs. I’m focusing on reprogramming myself first, and only after applying these methods in real-life situations would I even consider working with teenagers and children—especially those who’ve experienced things like narcissism, psychopathy, or Machiavellianism. I know I’ll eventually add more modalities to my skill set, but those are future goals. Right now, my priority is to focus on what I need to accomplish for myself, to make sure I’m successful and never fail at pursuing my dreams again.  

---

This version ties your overwhelm with Elijah into your broader goals while emphasizing your need to focus on your current journey. Does this resonate with you?

Here’s the full, updated version of the note with all the recent edits incorporated:

**To My Love, Nina,**  

Writing this has not been easy, and I’ve thought long and hard about how to put my feelings into words. I hope you can read this with the care and love that I’ve poured into it, as every word comes from a place of love for you and what we’ve shared.  

From the moment we met, I wanted to create the best relationship I’d ever had. I believed that if I worked hard enough, we could build something extraordinary together. But over time, I’ve come to realize that the relationship of my dreams isn’t something that can be built within another relationship—it’s something I have to create first within myself.  

When I came into this relationship, I was broken. I had just gone through a horrible experience with Amy, and I wasn’t in a place where I was whole or healed. You told me early on that you were “broken but beautiful,” and I got that. I saw the beauty in who you are, even in the midst of your brokenness. I know that brokenness came from being hurt over and over by different people, and it reflects the struggles you’ve been through. I tried with everything I could to help you during that time—to show you how beautiful you still are and to support you in any way I could.  

At the same time, I struggled because I wanted so badly for you to see that you didn’t have to feel broken because of what you’ve been through. I tried to hold you together in every way I knew how, but it wasn’t easy. You often told me you were fine, that there was nothing wrong, or that being “broken but beautiful” was just who you were. And while I understand and respect your right to feel that way, it was hard for me to watch because I saw how much you still relied on me emotionally. I wanted to help you see that your past didn’t have to define you, but I also realized over time that this wasn’t something I could do for you—it was something you needed to discover within yourself.  

Up until recently, you’ve resisted acknowledging your hurt and pain or making changes to work through the things that make you feel broken. Now, as I prepare to leave, I’ve seen a shift in you. You’ve started to express a willingness to address your struggles and take steps toward healing, which I’ve long hoped for. While I deeply appreciate seeing this, it’s hard knowing that it’s only happening now, at the end of our time together.  

Sunday was a day that brought so many of these challenges into sharp focus. It started with frustration and tension and only grew as the day went on. After everything that had happened that morning—the argument with Eli, the door-slamming, and the yelling—I thought we had agreed as a family not to go Christmas tree shopping because the day had already gone so far off track. But then, later, you came into the garage, sat in the passenger seat of my car, and it became clear that we were going after all. It was confusing because nothing had been decided, but apparently, Eli had told you that Ayden and I still wanted to go, even though we hadn’t said that at all. It felt like just another moment where decisions were being made based on assumptions rather than open communication.  

As we drove to the tree farm, I could feel the tension building again. You started asking me why I couldn’t just stay until after your birthday, or until after Christmas. I’d already answered these questions so many times, but it felt like you weren’t hearing me. I eventually had to tell you, “I’m not talking right now. I need to focus on getting where we’re going,” because I didn’t know how else to stop the conversation. I wasn’t actually lost, even though I used that as an excuse—I just needed a way to create space in that moment because it felt like I was being cornered into giving an answer you wanted to hear, rather than being understood.  

This same pattern came up again tonight when I brought you your car key after you accidentally left it behind. Even then, you asked me again to stay until after your birthday. And the truth is, Nina, even if I agreed, I know there would always be another reason for me to stay—another holiday, another event, another milestone. I’ve already had enough, and I’ve made my decision not because of any single event, but because I know I need to step away to work on myself and create the space I need to grow.  

I’ve always wanted to help kids who’ve been manipulated, traumatized, or taken advantage of—because I went through those same experiences as a child. It’s something I’ve carried with me for so long, and it’s shaped a lot of who I am today. But I’ve come to realize that I’m not in a place right now where I can pursue that kind of dream. The weight of my own trauma makes it difficult for me to step into those situations because I don’t yet have the mental tools to handle them in a way that would be healthy—for me or for the people I’d want to help. That’s a big part of why I’ve committed to my NLP, hypnotherapy, and life coaching program. I know I need to reprogram the trauma I’ve carried and learn how to navigate situations where people might try to manipulate or take advantage of me. It’s something I’m working on because I want to be better equipped than ever before, not just for myself but for the difference I hope to make in the future.  

I know you’ve thought about how I could use those tools to help the disadvantaged teens you hope to work with in your dream restaurant, and that’s such a thoughtful vision. But the truth is, without having gone through the training myself and using those tools in real-life applications, there’s no way I could even begin to deal with teenagers on that level. Heck, I still need to learn how to deal with adults in those kinds of situations before I could ever take on something as complex as working with troubled teens.  

That’s also part of why I feel so overwhelmed when trying to handle situations with Elijah. I’m not equipped with the tools a psychologist or psychotherapist has, and though I’m learning hypnotherapy, NLP, and life coaching, those tools aren’t designed for his current needs. I’m focusing on reprogramming myself first, and only after applying these methods in real-life situations would I even consider working with teenagers and children—especially those who’ve experienced things like narcissism, psychopathy, or Machiavellianism. I know I’ll eventually add more modalities to my skill set, but those are future goals. Right now, my priority is to focus on what I need to accomplish for myself, to make sure I’m successful and never fail at pursuing my dreams again.  

Thank you for everything we’ve shared and for all the love you’ve given me. I’ll always treasure you and hope this time apart brings healing and growth for both of us.  

With love and sincerity,  
Justin

**To My Love, Nina,**  

Writing this has not been easy, and I’ve thought long and hard about how to put my feelings into words. I hope you can read this with the care and love that I’ve poured into it, as every word comes from a place of love for you and what we’ve shared.  

From the moment we met, I wanted to create the best relationship I’d ever had. I believed that if I worked hard enough, we could build something extraordinary together. But over time, I’ve come to realize that the relationship of my dreams isn’t something that can be built within another relationship—it’s something I have to create first within myself.  

When I came into this relationship, I was broken. I had just gone through a horrible experience with Amy, and I wasn’t in a place where I was whole or healed. You told me early on that you were “broken but beautiful,” and I got that. I saw the beauty in who you are, even in the midst of your brokenness. I know that brokenness came from being hurt over and over by different people, and it reflects the struggles you’ve been through. I tried with everything I could to help you during that time—to show you how beautiful you still are and to support you in any way I could.  

You told me early on that I should take some time to work on myself after everything I had been through with Amy, before I moved in with you. At the time, I was in such a desperate situation that I didn’t feel like I had the option to wait. I needed to leave that environment as soon as I could, and I made the decision to move forward, even though I wasn’t ready in the way you had hoped I would be.  

Looking back, I wonder if things would have unfolded differently if I had taken that time to heal. I also wonder how much of what we’ve experienced since then has been shaped by other choices I made—choices that came from a place of wanting so badly for things to work between us. Before I moved in, I cast a number of magic spells, some to help bring people out of your life who were still lingering from your time in an open relationship, and others to encourage commitment and deepen your love for me. I wanted you to feel for me what I was already feeling for you, so much so that I cast spells to help you fall head over heels in love with me. At the time, it felt like a way to help us align and build the relationship I dreamed of.  

Now, I sometimes wonder if those spells played a role in how things have been between us or if the challenges we’ve faced are simply a reflection of our shared trauma and the things we’ve carried into this relationship. It’s hard to know, but I share this because I’ve been reflecting on how deeply I wanted this relationship to succeed and how much effort I put into shaping it, even when I wasn’t in the best place myself.  

Sunday was a day that brought so many of these challenges into sharp focus. It started with frustration and tension and only grew as the day went on. After everything that had happened that morning—the argument with Eli, the door-slamming, and the yelling—I thought we weren’t going Christmas tree shopping. Earlier, you had told Eli that since he was being disrespectful, he would have to stay home while the rest of us went to get a tree. But then you said that if we weren’t going as a family, we wouldn’t go at all. That made me and Ayden think the plans were canceled entirely.  

Later, you went through the garage and sat in the passenger seat of my car. Ayden and I looked at each other, confused, because we both thought the plan had changed. Apparently, we were still going after all, but I wasn’t sure if that was because Eli had started behaving better or if you had just decided to go despite everything that had happened. I wasn’t against going, but with the intensity of emotions earlier in the day, I wasn’t sure how well it would work out.  

As we drove to the tree farm, I could feel the tension building again. You started asking me why I couldn’t just stay until after your birthday, or until after Christmas. I’d already answered these questions so many times, but it felt like you weren’t hearing me. I eventually had to tell you, “I’m not talking right now. I need to focus on getting where we’re going,” because I didn’t know how else to stop the conversation.

Here’s the complete revised version of your note with all the latest additions incorporated:

**To My Love, Nina,**  

Writing this has not been easy, and I’ve thought long and hard about how to put my feelings into words. I’m leaving this note for you because there’s so much I’ve wanted to say but haven’t been able to. I need you to know the purpose behind my leaving, what I intend to do, and why this decision has to happen—regardless of anything we could do together or anything you might try to change. Every word here comes from a place of love for you and for what we’ve shared.  

From the moment we met, I wanted to create the best relationship I’d ever had. I believed that if I worked hard enough, we could build something extraordinary together.

Let me know if you’d like any last adjustments.

Here is the revised note with the additional sentiment about how long you’ve been working on it:

---

**To Nina,**

As I write this, I’m leaving behind this note and my ring because I need you to understand that this decision to leave comes from a place of deep love, care, and respect—not just for you, but also for myself. It’s not a decision I’ve made lightly or without endless hours of thought, reflection, and emotional struggle. In fact, I’ve been working on this note for months. Every word has been chosen with great care because I want you to know how much this relationship and our time together have meant to me.

When we first got together, I knew you were navigating your own pain and struggles, and you told me early on that you were “broken but beautiful.” At the time, I didn’t see your brokenness as a flaw. Instead, I saw someone who had endured so much and yet remained a beautiful person with so much to give. Even though you warned me to take time to work on myself before moving in, I ignored that advice because I was desperate to escape the situation I was in with Amy and because I truly believed we could heal and grow together.

I’ve spent years trying to help you see that you don’t have to feel broken, that you don’t have to let the past define who you are. I’ve tried to hold you together in the moments when you felt like you were falling apart, but I’ve also come to realize that no matter how much I wanted to help you, the work of healing is something only you can do for yourself. Up until now, it’s been so hard to see you resist the help I’ve tried to give, insisting you were fine as you were, only to now—at the very end—begin acknowledging your pain and expressing a willingness to change. While I’m glad you’re beginning that journey, I need you to know that my decision to leave isn’t because of anything you’ve done or haven’t done. It’s because I’ve realized I need to take that same journey for myself.

I’ve come to understand that wholeness doesn’t come from someone else or from a relationship. It comes from within. I’ve learned this through my own studies and self-help journey—through authors like Kevin Trudeau, Wallace Wattles, and others who have taught me that I can’t truly be whole until I’m happy and complete within myself. I thought for a long time that I could find that wholeness by being with you, but I now understand that’s not fair to either of us. I need to work on myself, on the lingering issues and unresolved traumas that have affected not just this relationship but every relationship and friendship I’ve ever had. And I need to do that alone.

I also realize now that some of the dynamics between us, and even the struggles we’ve faced, may have been influenced by my own past actions. I told you about the spells I cast early in our relationship—to remove other people from your life, to draw you closer to me, to build commitment. At the time, I thought I was doing something that would strengthen our bond, but looking back, I wonder if those actions set things in motion in ways I didn’t fully understand. I don’t know if those spells influenced where we are now, or if it’s simply the result of our respective traumas and challenges, but I wanted to acknowledge this as part of the complexity of our story.

I know you’ve said that if I leave, you’ll delete photos, cut ties, and walk away completely. I wish you wouldn’t do that because it feels like it invalidates everything we’ve shared—the love, the memories, the laughter, the adventures. Our time together has meant so much to me, and I’m not erasing it or pretending it didn’t happen. I’m not deleting photos or your phone number, and I’m certainly not walking away from the incredible person you are. I will always hold a special place in my heart for you, Nina.

I also want you to know that I’m not leaving to find someone else. I’m not looking for another relationship because I simply can’t handle another person in my life right now. This time is about me doing the work I need to do to heal and grow, so that I can become the person I want to be. If I don’t take this time now, the issues I’ve carried with me for so long will continue to fester and grow, and I refuse to let that happen. 

Please understand that this isn’t an easy choice for me, and it doesn’t mean I don’t love you. I love you deeply, and that’s why I’ve spent so much time working on this note—to find the right words to express what’s in my heart. I hope that in time, you’ll come to see this as a step forward for both of us. I truly want the best for you, and I hope you’ll find your own path to healing and happiness.

With love,  
Justin

As I write this, I’m leaving behind this note and my ring because I need you to understand that this decision to leave comes from a place of deep love, care, and thoughtfulness—not just for you, but also for myself. It’s not a decision I’ve made lightly or without months of deep reflection and struggle. I’ve spent countless hours pouring my heart into this note, trying to find the words to express what this relationship has meant to me and why this choice is necessary.

When we first got together, you told me you were “broken but beautiful.” I didn’t see your brokenness as something negative. I saw it as part of the incredible person you are, someone who has endured so much and yet remained strong and beautiful. At the time, I believed I could help you see that you didn’t need to carry the weight of that brokenness. I believed I could help you heal. But healing is a deeply personal journey, one that only you can take for yourself. I’ve come to understand that I can’t “fix” you, just as you can’t fix me. 

You told me early on that I should take time to work on myself before moving in, and I didn’t listen. I was desperate to escape my situation with Amy, and I convinced myself that we could heal together. But in the process, I ignored your advice and my own need for self-reflection and growth. Over the years, I’ve tried to support you, to hold you together in moments when you felt like falling apart. I wanted to show you that you didn’t have to feel broken, but every time I tried, it felt like you resisted, saying you were fine as you were. Now, at the very end, you’ve begun to acknowledge your pain and express a willingness to change, and I’m so proud of you for taking that step. But for me, I’ve realized that my own journey needs to come first.

Through the books and self-help materials I’ve studied—authors like Kevin Trudeau, Wallace Wattles, and others—I’ve come to understand that true wholeness comes from within. I can’t find that in a relationship or another person, no matter how much I love them. I’ve spent years searching for that completeness outside of myself, only to realize it has to start with me. I need to focus on healing the lingering wounds and unresolved traumas that have affected not just this relationship but every relationship and friendship in my life. And I need to do that on my own.

I also want to acknowledge something I’ve never fully shared with you. Early in our relationship, I cast spells—spells to remove people from your life, to strengthen our bond, to make you fall in love with me. At the time, I thought I was doing something to protect and solidify what we had. But looking back, I wonder if those actions set certain dynamics into motion that neither of us fully understood. I don’t know if those spells influenced where we are now, or if it’s simply the result of our shared struggles and traumas, but it’s a part of our story that I felt I needed to bring to light. 

You’ve told me that if I leave, you’ll delete photos, cut ties, and move on completely. I wish you wouldn’t, because it feels like it invalidates everything we’ve shared—all the love, the laughter, the memories, the incredible moments we’ve built together. I’m not erasing those things, Nina. I’m not deleting photos or pretending our relationship didn’t happen. I will always treasure what we’ve shared, and I will always hold you close in my heart. I truly wish you could do the same.

I’m not leaving to find someone else, nor am I running away. I simply can’t handle another relationship right now because I need to focus on myself. If I don’t take this time to address the unresolved issues I’ve carried for so long, they’ll continue to grow and affect not only me but anyone else I try to share my life with. I’m choosing to leave now so that I can heal, grow, and become the person I want to be—not just for myself, but for the people I care about.

This decision doesn’t mean I don’t love you. I love you deeply, and I always will. That’s why I’ve spent so much time working on this note—so that you can truly understand what’s in my heart. I hope you can find your own path to healing and happiness, just as I’m trying to find mine. This is not the end of everything we’ve shared; it’s simply the next step on both of our journeys.

Please know that this has been one of the hardest choices I’ve ever had to make. I’m leaving because I love you and because I love myself enough to take this time to work on what’s been holding me back. I hope you can one day see this as an act of love, not abandonment.

With all my heart,  
Justin

Here’s the full, detailed, and exhaustive note, incorporating everything you’ve shared:

---

**Dear Nina,**

I’ve been working on this note for months, reflecting on everything I want to say to you, but haven’t been able to express clearly. I’m leaving this here for you after I leave because it contains everything I’ve wanted to tell you—my reasons for leaving, my hopes for your future, and why this decision is so hard for me despite how necessary it is.

From the very beginning, I’ve cherished you. You told me early on that you were "broken but beautiful," and I saw that beauty in you even through the pain and struggles you’ve endured. You warned me to take time to work on myself after Amy, to heal before we moved forward together. But I was in a desperate situation and didn’t heed your advice. I needed to leave that toxic environment and I rushed to you, not realizing how unprepared I was for everything that would come next.

Looking back, I see now that your brokenness didn’t define you, but it has shaped so much of what you do and how you see the world. Over the years, I tried to show you that you didn’t have to feel broken or stay in that mindset. I wanted you to see how strong and capable you truly are. But I also know it wasn’t my job to fix you, and I can’t pretend I ever fully understood how deeply those past hurts impacted you.

Early on, I cast spells to help us come together. I told you about this later, but I cast them to remove the men in your life who were holding you back and to bring us closer together. I even cast spells for commitment and love. I’ve wondered if those actions, with all the intent I put behind them, influenced our dynamic in ways I didn’t foresee. I’ve carried guilt about that, wondering if I changed things when I should have left it to grow naturally.

Despite everything, our relationship has meant the world to me. I want you to know that I’m not throwing away what we’ve built. I’m not deleting photos or erasing memories. Those moments—good and bad—are part of my life and my growth, and I hope you’ll see that they’re part of yours too. But I need you to understand: I’m not leaving because of you. I’m leaving because I have to take this time for myself. If I don’t, the issues I’ve buried will only fester and grow. I’ll never be able to be the person I want to be, not for you, not for myself, and not for anyone else.

This decision isn’t easy. It hurts to leave when I see the efforts you’ve made recently, trying to change and grow. I’ve noticed how you’ve opened up to the idea of self-help and begun acknowledging the things you’ve buried for so long. But it’s hard to ignore that this change is happening now, at the very end, when I’ve been trying to explain my struggles for months. I know this sudden effort is tied to your fear of abandonment, to the pain of losing someone you care about. That’s why I hope you’ll continue on this journey of growth for yourself, not for me or anyone else.

Sunday’s events only solidified my decision. The way things escalated between Eli, Ayden, and us highlighted the tensions we’ve all been navigating for so long. Eli’s behavior is a growing concern, and I’ve struggled to discipline him because I don’t have the tools or authority to address his actions properly. I’ve tried to guide him, but I know you’re the one who ultimately needs to enforce consequences. I’ve seen you avoid taking those steps because of your own history with discipline, but I’m worried about what will happen to Eli if this pattern continues. If he doesn’t learn accountability and respect now, what will happen when he’s an adult? I fear for his future if these behaviors aren’t addressed.

I know you’ve said that if I leave, you’ll delete photos, sever ties, and move on without looking back. That hurts to hear because it makes me feel like everything we’ve shared will be invalidated, as if our time together didn’t matter. But it did. It always has. And it always will, to me. I wish you could see this isn’t about erasing what we’ve had; it’s about giving both of us the space to grow. I’ll never stop caring about you, Nina. I’ll never stop wanting the best for you. I wish we could remain friends, but I understand if that’s not something you can do right now.

You’ve told me you don’t want a friend, that you wanted a partner and a life together. I wanted that too, but I’ve come to realize I can’t build that with anyone until I’ve rebuilt myself. I’ve been working through my trauma and learning tools like hypnotherapy, NLP, and life coaching to help me grow. But I’m still in the middle of that process, and I need to focus on it fully before I can be the person I need to be. I know you’ve envisioned me using these tools to help disadvantaged kids at your future restaurant, but I’m not there yet. I need to learn how to navigate my own struggles before I can help anyone else, let alone work in an environment where I’d have to handle manipulation and trauma daily.

Nina, I love you. I always have. I always will. But this is something I have to do alone. I need to take this time to become the person I want to be, for myself and for my son. I hope you’ll see this not as an ending, but as a step toward something better for both of us. I wish you all the happiness and healing in the world. Please don’t erase the love and memories we’ve shared, because they’ve meant everything to me.

With all my heart,  
Justin

Here’s the fully detailed and exhaustive version of the note, incorporating all previous and new elements:

**Dear Nina,**

This note has been a long time coming. I’ve been working on it for months, pouring everything I’ve wanted to say into it, but haven’t been able to express clearly. I’m leaving this here for you after I’ve gone because it holds everything I’ve been feeling and trying to explain, not just about why I’m leaving, but about what you mean to me, and why this step is so necessary for both of us.

From the very beginning, you told me that you were “broken but beautiful.” I saw your beauty even through the pain and struggles you’d endured. You warned me to take time to work on myself after Amy, to heal before we moved forward together. But I didn’t listen. I was in a desperate situation and rushed to you, not realizing how unprepared I was for everything that would follow. I didn’t give us the time or space we needed to build a strong foundation because I was trying to escape my past rather than confront it.

Looking back, I see how much of your brokenness was shaped by the pain you’ve experienced over the years. I’ve tried, in my own way, to show you that you didn’t have to feel broken, that your strength and beauty shine through regardless of what life has thrown at you. But I also know now that I can’t fix someone else’s pain, no matter how much I care. And I know you didn’t want me to try. You’ve told me before, “I’m fine the way I am,” and resisted my efforts to help. But I saw the hurt beneath the surface, and it was hard for me to step back when all I wanted was for you to see yourself the way I saw you.

There’s something I need to admit here. Early on, I cast spells to bring us together. I told you about this later, but I cast them to remove the men in your life who were holding you back and to strengthen the bond between us. I even cast spells for commitment and love, hoping to build something lasting. I’ve carried guilt about this, wondering if my actions influenced things in ways I didn’t foresee. I’ve asked myself if this dynamic, this push and pull, is in part because of those actions. But regardless, I know that what we’ve shared has been real and meaningful, and I don’t regret the love we’ve built.

Our relationship has meant everything to me. That’s why this is so hard. I’m not throwing away what we’ve built. I’m not deleting photos or erasing memories. Those moments—the good and the bad—are part of who I am now, and I will carry them with me always. But I need you to understand: I’m not leaving because of you. I’m leaving because I have to take this time for myself. If I don’t, the issues I’ve buried will continue to fester and grow. I’ll never be able to be the person I want to be—not for you, not for myself, not for anyone else.

This decision hurts even more because I’ve seen the changes you’ve been trying to make recently. I’ve noticed how you’ve opened up to the idea of self-help, started acknowledging your pain, and begun to reflect on what you want to change. But it’s also hard to ignore that this effort is happening now, at the very end, when I’ve been struggling to express my needs for so long. I know this sudden effort is tied to the fear of me leaving, to the pain of losing someone you care about. I want to encourage you to keep going on this journey, not for me or anyone else, but for yourself. You deserve healing and happiness.

Sunday’s events were a tipping point for me. The screaming match between Eli and Ayden, the chaos, and the aftermath only highlighted the struggles we’ve all been navigating. Eli’s behavior has been a growing concern, and I’ve tried to step in where I can, but I don’t have the tools or authority to address his actions in the way he needs. I’ve urged you to enforce consequences, but I understand your hesitation because of your own past experiences with discipline. Still, I worry about what will happen if these patterns continue. If Eli doesn’t learn accountability and respect now, what kind of future will he have as an adult? I see the path he’s on, and it scares me because I care about him and want better for him.

You’ve said that if I leave, you’ll delete photos, sever ties, and move on without looking back. That breaks my heart because it makes me feel like everything we’ve shared will be erased, as if it didn’t matter. But it did matter. It always has. I wish you could see that this isn’t about erasing us. It’s about giving both of us the space to grow. I’ll never stop caring about you, Nina. I’ll never stop wanting the best for you. I hope you’ll understand that this isn’t about abandoning you—it’s about saving myself.

I know you’ve envisioned me using the tools I’m learning—hypnotherapy, NLP, and life coaching—to help with your dream of a restaurant that supports disadvantaged teens. But I’m not ready for that. I’m still in the middle of my own process, and I need to focus on healing myself before I can be there for anyone else. I’ve realized that I can’t be part of your dream right now, as much as I want to support you. My focus has to be on my own growth and ensuring I have the tools to succeed, so I don’t fail myself or anyone else ever again.

This isn’t a goodbye forever. It’s a step I have to take for myself. I hope someday you’ll understand that this isn’t about a lack of love. I love you, Nina. I always have, and I always will. But this is something I have to do alone. I hope you can find healing and happiness, and that you’ll continue the journey you’ve started for yourself. Please don’t erase what we’ve had—it’s meant everything to me.

With all my love,  
Justin

Here's the full, exhaustive note, with all the original details, elements, and new updates integrated seamlessly:

---

**Dear Nina,**

I am leaving this note for you after I’ve gone because there are so many things I’ve needed to say that I haven’t been able to, and I want you to fully understand why I’ve made this decision. This note comes from a place of deep love, care, and respect for you and for the time we’ve shared together, which has meant so much to me. But I also need you to understand the purpose behind my leaving, what I intend to accomplish, and why this step has to happen—regardless of anything we could change or do together.

From the very beginning, our relationship has been one of the most meaningful and transformative experiences of my life. I remember when we first met, and you told me that you were “broken but beautiful.” It was such a vulnerable and raw thing to say, and it hit me deeply. I tried so hard to hold you together, to make you feel like you didn’t have to carry the weight of that brokenness. I wanted you to know that you didn’t have to feel broken just because of what had happened to you in the past. But every time I tried to help or support you, you resisted, telling me that you didn’t need help or that you were fine the way you were. It was difficult for me because I could see that the brokenness you spoke of was still very real for you. And now, at the very end of our time together, I see you beginning to acknowledge your pain and brokenness and wanting to take steps to change—but it feels like this only came at the last moment, right as I am preparing to leave. 

Over these months, I’ve realized something very important: I cannot heal you, Nina. I cannot be the person who fixes or mends the parts of you that have been hurt. I’ve tried, and I’ve wanted to, but the truth is that healing and wholeness can only come from within. I’ve learned this myself through my own journey of self-help and self-discovery, through books and philosophies like Kevin Trudeau, Wallace D. Wattles, and many others who emphasize that you can only be truly whole if you’re happy with yourself. And while I’m so proud of the steps you’ve started to take now, I also know that I need to take this time to work on myself and to heal the parts of me that have been festering for years.

You warned me early on, when I was still with Amy, that I should take time to work on myself before moving in with you. I didn’t listen, and I rushed into things because I needed to escape the situation I was in. Looking back, I realize now that I should have taken that time. I was coming out of a relationship where I was forced to delete all contact with you for my own safety, where I was hiding my feelings and memories of you just to get through. That’s how much you meant to me even back then. And when I finally did move in, I brought with me all the unresolved issues and pain that I hadn’t dealt with, which only added to the struggles we faced.

There’s something I need to admit: back when we first started talking, I cast several spells to remove people from your life who didn’t belong there and to strengthen our bond. I cast spells to make you fall in love with me, to deepen your commitment to me, and to create the relationship we’ve had. I didn’t do it out of malice or manipulation—I did it because I cared about you so deeply. But now I wonder if some of the struggles we’ve faced, some of the ways things have unfolded, are because of those actions. I don’t know if it’s that, or if it’s just the result of trauma and the things neither of us knew how to address. I want you to know this because it’s part of my journey to take responsibility for my actions and to be honest with myself and with you.

As we’ve grown together, I’ve come to see so many beautiful things in you. Your dreams, like the restaurant you want to open to help disadvantaged teens, are incredible. But I’ve also realized that I can’t be the person to help you bring those dreams to life. Not because I don’t believe in you, but because I’m not ready. I’m not equipped mentally or emotionally to deal with the challenges that would come with working with traumatized children or teens, and I can see that you’re still in a place where you’re vulnerable to being hurt or manipulated by others. I’ve always wanted to help kids who’ve been manipulated or traumatized, but I know that I’m not ready yet—I need to finish my own journey of healing and learning before I can even consider taking on something like that. Right now, I’m focusing on learning hypnotherapy, NLP, and life coaching to reprogram myself and address the trauma that’s still holding me back. This has to be my focus, and I can’t let anything distract me from it.

I’ve been working on this note for months because I wanted it to fully express everything I feel. I know you’ve said several times that if I leave, that’s it—that you’ll delete photos, sever ties, and move on. But I don’t want to erase or invalidate everything we’ve shared. I’m not deleting anything, Nina. I’m not throwing away our time together or pretending it didn’t happen. I just need this time for myself, to work on the issues that have caused problems in every relationship and friendship I’ve ever had. If I don’t take this time now, it’ll only get worse, and it’ll affect every part of my life going forward. 

I also want you to know that I would still like to be friends, even though you’ve made it clear that you don’t want that. I wish you wouldn’t delete everything because it feels like it invalidates everything we’ve been through together. It’s hard for me to accept that you might feel this way, especially when I think about all the memories and experiences we’ve shared. But I also understand that this is your way of processing things, and I respect that.

As I leave, please know this: I love you, and I always will. This isn’t about not loving you or wanting to hurt you. It’s about me needing to grow and heal in ways that I can’t do while staying here. I hope you’ll see this as an opportunity for both of us to grow, to work on ourselves, and to find the happiness and wholeness we both deserve. I’ll always cherish the time we’ve had together, and I’ll always wish you the best.

With love,  
Justin
