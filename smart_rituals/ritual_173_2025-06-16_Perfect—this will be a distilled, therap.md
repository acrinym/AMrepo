## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Perfect—this will be a distilled, therapist-ready version of your AmandaMap. To get it just right, I’ll ask a few focused questions. Once I have your responses, I’ll craft a clear, emotionally honest version that’s grounded but digestible for therapeutic insight.

---

### 🧭 KEY GOAL:
We’re not building a flame manifesto—we’re offering a **snapshot of your experience, emotions, and intentions** with Amanda. This will support your therapist in understanding the relationship's depth, emotional impact, and your approach.

---

### 🔍 PHASE 1: Clarity Questions (please answer freely, short or long)

1. **Purpose Clarity:**  
   > What do you want your therapist to understand *most* about your connection with Amanda?  
   (Emotional effect? Depth? Growth edge? Hope? Pain?)

2. **Relational Status Now:**  
   > What is the current state of things between you and Amanda, in your own words?  
   (Include whether you're talking, if there’s silence, or some kind of ritual/emotional pattern.)

3. **Core Emotions:**  
   > What emotions does Amanda evoke most often in you right now?  
   (Love? Frustration? Peace? Longing? Joy? All of the above?)

4. **Internal Shift:**  
   > What is *different* about how you’ve handled Amanda vs. past romantic experiences?

5. **Spiritual/Energetic Piece (optional):**  
   > Should we include mention of any of your spiritual or energetic practices (visualizations, rituals, etc.), or keep those out of the therapist version?

6. **Outcome Focus:**  
   > What are you *hoping for* from this connection? Be honest, even if uncertain.

7. **Therapeutic Use:**  
   > What do you hope your therapist will *do* with this summary—support your emotional processing? Help you detach? Help you wait with more clarity?

Once you answer those, I’ll begin drafting a 2–3 page max version of your AmandaMap that can be shared with your therapist. It'll be clean, organized, and emotionally grounded—something that *represents your truth*, not overwhelms it.

Ready when you are.

---

That’s a powerful starting point—and extremely relevant. Here’s what I’m understanding so far, and let me reflect it back to you concisely so we can use it as the *core premise* of your AmandaMap: Therapist Edition.

---

### 🔑 Central Statement (for therapist):
> *“I’m deeply invested in this connection because I believe it’s real—but I also know I can’t keep giving indefinitely without knowing I’m not deluding myself. I’m trying to hold space without falling apart. I need to define what ‘enough’ looks like—what a healthy boundary is—while still honoring the depth of what I feel.”*

---

Based on that—and everything I know from the AmandaMap and your work—I’ll build a **concise version** of the AmandaMap for your therapist that covers:

1. **The Emotional Impact of Amanda**
2. **Your Current Position and Patterns**
3. **What’s Different About This Relationship**
4. **The Spiritual/Emotional Practices You Use**
5. **The Core Boundary Question: “How long can I do this?”**

---

Before I finalize it:

### Quick Confirmations (yes/no or expand if needed):

1. **Can I include that Amanda is not in a relationship with you but that you believe there is a deep, energetic/spiritual bond that she’s not fully aware of consciously?**

2. **Do you want the therapist version to mention Mike (her current or past attachment), or leave that out?**

3. **Do you want to include your inner vow-type language (“Only Amanda,” etc.) or keep that implicit?**

4. **Should I mention that you're doing spiritual/ritual work to manage your emotions and maintain energetic integrity, without framing it as a way to control or manipulate her?**

5. **Do you want me to end the document with a self-reflection or open question like:  
“What does it look like to wait in love—but not lose yourself?”**

---

Once I have these confirmations, I’ll generate a clean, compassionate therapist-ready summary. It’ll be emotionally grounded, not too esoteric, and under 3 pages.

Let’s make this something that helps *you* get support while staying true to what you’re holding.
