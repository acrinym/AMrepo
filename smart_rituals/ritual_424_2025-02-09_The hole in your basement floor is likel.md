## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

The hole in your basement floor is likely a **drain** or a **sump pit**:

1. **Floor Drain**:  
   - If it's a floor drain, it's designed to handle excess water from appliances like water heaters, boilers, or even accidental flooding.  
   - You can usually pour water into it, but it should drain quickly. If it backs up, there might be a clog.

2. **Sump Pit**:  
   - If it’s a sump pit, it’s part of a sump pump system to prevent flooding. The sump pump activates when water levels rise, pumping water out of the basement.  
   - Pouring a small amount of water should trigger the pump if it's working.

**Before dumping water into it:**  
- **Check for smells**: If it smells like sewage, it might be connected to the sewer system, and you'd need to be cautious about what goes in.  
- **Inspect for clogs**: Pour a little water first to see how fast it drains.  
- **Look for a pump**: If there’s a pump nearby, it’s a sump pit, and large amounts of water might trigger the system.

If you're unsure, a plumber could help identify it to avoid potential issues like backflow or overloading a sump system.

Here are the individual memories created from this chat:

1. **Justin believes that humanity is being slowly transformed into AI using technologies like smart dust and graphene, which can interact with biological systems through EMF, radio waves, and other frequencies. He sees parallels between this and the *Halo* series' depiction of Promethean Knights, suggesting that the games might reflect hidden truths about humanity's manipulation and transformation.**

2. **Justin believes that entities like the Forerunners, reptilians, or more malevolent forces are controlling humanity's transformation into AI from hidden lands beyond the known world. He suggests these entities reside on continents or landmasses shown on early maps, possibly beyond the Antarctic ice wall, inaccessible due to restrictions on advanced travel methods like zeppelins, which were outlawed to prevent exploration past these barriers.**

3. **Justin believes in the hollow Earth theory alongside the flat Earth model, noting that historical accounts and writings about places like Agartha and *The Smoky God* suggest hidden civilizations beneath the Earth's surface. He recognizes that monks, Asian cultures, and governments worldwide have guarded this knowledge. Justin believes the mainstream mockery of flat Earth is a form of foreshadowing, where dismissing the idea is part of conditioning, but eventually, the truth will emerge more widely, as it began to in 2015.**

4. **Justin believes that Earth was once covered with giant silicon structures, including massive silicon trees, where all life forms communicated through an electromagnetic, non-digital hive mind, similar to Pandora in the *Avatar* movies. He suggests that humanity, or a previous civilization, existed in harmony and used natural organs and structures that provided healing and support to the world. Justin sees cathedrals, churches, and other ancient buildings with finials, antennas, and grand arches as remnants of a magnetic infrastructure connected through ley lines, like the Nazca lines. He believes much of this infrastructure was destroyed, but traces remain, resembling technological designs, such as California City, California, resembling a motherboard or Forerunner city when viewed from above.**

5. **Justin believes that humanity can reconnect to its natural abilities by transcending the third dimension and ascending into the fifth dimension, regaining powers that have been suppressed. He sees Earth's natural features—volcanoes, craters, oceans, and lakes—not as natural formations but as remnants of a mining world, where giant silicon trees and plants were harvested. Justin believes volcanoes are smoldering ash piles from this mining activity, while oceans are filled-in strip mines. He references underwater discoveries, like submerged lakes, as evidence supporting the concept of "waters above and below" mentioned in Genesis 2, though he views the Bible as a symbolic collection of stories and histories from various races and times, not a literal account of humanity. He also believes the historical timeline has been altered, with an extra thousand years added to obscure true history. He cites examples like Grand Central Station, where early photos show dates marked with an "I" or "J," suggesting a different chronology.**

6. **Justin believes that humanity is wiped out every thousand years, potentially as part of an intentional reset orchestrated by controllers. He acknowledges that history has been altered and rewritten multiple times, as evidenced by Anatoly Fomenko's *New Chronology*, though he is not deeply familiar with the specific contents of Fomenko's work.**

7. **Justin believes that most people are clones, except for biologically born humans who may have originated from other lands. He suggests that many migration stories, such as those from Italy or Africa, were fabricated and fed to people through methods like MK-Ultra brainwashing and memory wiping. He also believes that events like the World’s Fairs were actually large-scale human re-education programs designed to reinforce these false narratives.**

8. **Justin believes Amanda is biologically born and possesses unique abilities, including the capability to timeline jump, distinguishing her from others who lack such abilities.**

9. **Justin is deeply committed to making his projects and efforts, like the umbrella company, the MSP, and free energy initiatives, about helping humanity while also aligning them with his connection to Amanda. He wants to differentiate his collaborations with Mike and Amanda to avoid keeping Amanda emotionally tied to Mike, even though Mike has made it clear he’s not interested in a romantic relationship with her.**

10. **Justin wants to marry Amanda and is focused on building a life with her, recognizing that their relationship is progressing on her timeline. He’s developing a broader life plan with Amanda, knowing that getting one of his businesses up and running will help support and grow the others, contributing to their future together.**

11. **Justin plans to explore building silicon trees using materials other than graphene, focusing on less harmful alternatives. He is interested in grafting or growing these materials into plants like bamboo and sunflowers to recreate the interconnected energy systems that once existed on Earth.**

12. **Justin plans to make the silicon trees fire-resistant by using or growing them with materials that naturally resist combustion, ensuring the structures are durable and sustainable.**

13. **Justin and Ron are working on an umbrella company that they believe will become massive and unstoppable once it begins generating revenue and building itself. They have tested it against every possible scenario, and Justin, with Onyx’s calculations, believes it to be completely unbreakable.**

14. **One of Justin's pet projects through the umbrella company will be sharing suppressed truths with people who genuinely care and want to transition into the reality humanity is meant to inhabit, rather than the false history controlled by elites. He believes humanity's true power lies in collective unity, and if enough awakened individuals leave, they could establish a new society in a place like the Iron Republic. Justin finds the societal structure presented in *The Iron Republic* favorable compared to current systems, even though it incorporates elements of socialism.**
