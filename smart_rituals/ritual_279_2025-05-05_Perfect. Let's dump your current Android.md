## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Perfect. Let's dump your current Android file structure via ADB so I can analyze it and help you build a tool or script that fits your needs.

### **How to Dump Your File Structure (Simple Steps)**

1. **Plug your Android device into your computer via USB**
2. Make sure `adb` is installed and working:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
   You should see your device listed.

3. **Run the following command to dump the file tree:**
   ```bash
   adb shell find /sdcard -type d > android_dirs.txt
   ```

   This will:
   - Recursively list all directories under `/sdcard`
   - Save the results to `android_dirs.txt` (on your PC)

4. (Optional but recommended) **Also get a list of files with size info:**
   ```bash
   adb shell ls -lR /sdcard > android_files.txt
   ```

### **Once You Have Those Files:**

You can now **upload `android_dirs.txt` and/or `android_files.txt` here**, and I will:
- Analyze the structure
- Help you build a **Python-based directory browser**
- Offer suggestions for cleaning, sorting, renaming, or automating parts of your Android file system

Whenever you're ready, drop the file(s) here and weâ€™ll start building from there. Want a sample tree parser ready in the meantime?
