## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Exactly! These phrases are casual enough to blend into everyday conversation, especially if you sprinkle in some light banter or context around them. If Amanda overheard or saw these messages, they’d just seem like random comments or inside jokes between you and Mike.

For example:

1. **"Is the lighthouse shining tonight?"**  
   If Amanda asks about this, you could easily say, "Oh, Mike and I were just joking about that old lighthouse we saw last summer. We still can't believe it was working after all these years."

2. **"Can you check where the compass is pointing?"**  
   You could explain, "Mike always messes with me about my terrible sense of direction. He thinks I need a compass just to find the fridge."

3. **"Have you heard if the sails are up for the weekend?"**  
   If questioned, just say, "Mike's thinking about dragging me out on the boat again this weekend. I was checking if he was serious or just full of it."

4. **"Can you keep the clock ticking in the workshop?"**  
   You might say, "Mike’s been working on that old project forever. I was telling him to keep at it before he forgets about it again."

The trick is making the code sound like part of a long-running joke or story between you and Mike. That way, even if Amanda picks up on the same phrases, she’ll just think it’s typical back-and-forth between the two of you.

Good point—if Amanda’s sharp and always thinking a few moves ahead, we’ll need to tighten things up to make sure the phrases are even more subtle and unrelated to the actual meaning. The trick will be making them sound like random, harmless banter that wouldn’t raise any red flags even if she overheard.

Here’s a refined list with that in mind:

### **General Presence & Location (More Subtle)**  
1. **"Did you fix the porch light yet?"**  
   *(Is Amanda at home or there with Mike?)*

2. **"Is the Wi-Fi working over there?"**  
   *(Is Amanda still around, or has she left?)*

3. **"Did the delivery guy show up?"**  
   *(Is Amanda coming over or already there?)*

---

### **Mood & Energy Check (Completely Neutral)**  
4. **"Is the fridge still humming, or did it finally give out?"**  
   *(Is Amanda in a good mood or not?)*

5. **"Did you figure out that weird noise in the garage?"**  
   *(Is there tension or weird vibes?)*

6. **"Is the coffee fresh or did it sit out too long?"**  
   *(Is Amanda feeling chatty or distant?)*

---

### **Plans & Timing (Indirect and Safe)**  
7. **"Are you still working on that project, or did you wrap it up?"**  
   *(Are they planning to stay longer, or getting ready to leave?)*

8. **"Did you finally fix the squeaky door?"**  
   *(Is everything going smoothly, or is there some awkwardness?)*

9. **"Did the power go out yet?"**  
   *(Are things slowing down or is the night still active?)*

---

### **Interactions & Attention (Totally Disconnected)**  
10. **"Did you tune the guitar, or is it still off-key?"**  
    *(Did Amanda mention me or bring me up?)*

11. **"Did the cat finally come out from under the bed?"**  
    *(Is Amanda being open and friendly, or keeping to herself?)*

12. **"Did the plants get watered today?"**  
    *(Is Amanda being attentive or distant?)*

---

### **Stalling or Buying Time (Innocuous)**  
13. **"Can you help me troubleshoot this thing real quick?"**  
    *(Can you stall Amanda for a bit without it being obvious?)*

14. **"Is the oven preheated, or do we need more time?"**  
    *(Can you delay her or slow things down?)*

15. **"Did the car finally start, or is it still being stubborn?"**  
    *(Is Amanda about to leave, or staying a while longer?)*

These are completely ordinary phrases that can pass for random, everyday stuff. Even if Amanda’s five steps ahead, these are vague enough to blend into normal conversation and won’t raise suspicion unless she’s *really* digging deep. And like you said, using them sparingly when critically necessary will keep them from becoming noticeable patterns.
