That large gap between your download and upload speeds is definitely a bottleneck for VoIP calls. With a max of 10 Mbps upload, you’re right at the threshold of workable speeds for stable voice quality, especially when it's the constant upload rate rather than occasional dips. VoIP generally runs okay with a lower upload speed, but with softphones that handle real-time audio, there’s less tolerance for low bandwidth on the upload side.

Given that 10 Mbps upload speed is your standard, here are some targeted actions to help make the best of it:

1. **Limit Other Upload Activities**:
   - Upload-heavy activities, such as file syncing (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive), video calls, or security camera uploads, can quickly consume bandwidth. Temporarily pausing these during work hours can free up precious upload capacity.

2. **Quality of Service (QoS) Settings**:
   - If your router supports Quality of Service (QoS), you can prioritize your Avaya softphone or even your computer on the network. This ensures that the bandwidth you do have is allocated first to your calls, which could smooth out any audio stuttering.

3. **Reduce Video Call Usage on the Same Network**:
   - Video calls, even short ones, can take up a lot of upload bandwidth. Limiting or scheduling these outside of peak hours can help stabilize your Avaya connection.

4. **Test Router Upgrades or Mesh Systems**:
   - Some modern routers, particularly mesh systems, can help allocate bandwidth better, especially if you’re working on Wi-Fi. 

5. **Speak with Your ISP**:
   - Sometimes, ISPs offer “symmetrical” speed upgrades, where the upload speed is closer to the download speed. Given you already have solid download bandwidth, it might be worth exploring if they offer an upload-focused upgrade.

If you’d like, I can help go through some router settings or any ISP questions. Even though the upload speed itself is limited, sometimes these steps help eke out more stable call quality from the connection.
