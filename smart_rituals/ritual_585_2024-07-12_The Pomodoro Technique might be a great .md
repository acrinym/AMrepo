The Pomodoro Technique might be a great fit for you. It involves working in short, focused bursts (usually twenty-five minutes), followed by a short break. This can help in maintaining focus and reducing burnout. Here's how it typically works:

1. Choose a task you want to work on.
2. Set a timer for twenty-five minutes.
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. Take a five-minute break.
5. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (fifteen to thirty minutes).

This technique can help you break tasks into manageable pieces and create a sense of urgency to stay focused. 

Taking focus supplements could also be beneficial if they work well for you. Combining them with a structured approach like the Pomodoro Technique might enhance your ability to concentrate.
