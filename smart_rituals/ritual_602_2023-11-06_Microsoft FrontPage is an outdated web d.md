Microsoft FrontPage is an outdated web development tool that was discontinued by Microsoft in 2003. It doesn't support modern web technologies like Web3 and isn't designed for current web development practices. If you're looking to work with Web3 and CSS for web development, you should consider using a modern web development environment and tools. Here's a general overview of what you would do in a more modern context:

1. **Web3 Integration:**
   Web3 is a set of JavaScript libraries for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and other blockchain technologies. To integrate Web3 into a website, you typically need to write JavaScript code that interacts with the Web3 library. Here's a high-level overview:

   - Start by creating an HTML file for your website.
   - Add the Web3 JavaScript library to your HTML document using a script tag.
   - Write JavaScript code to connect to a Web3 provider, such as MetaMask, and interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

   FrontPage does not support the integration of modern JavaScript libraries and technologies. To work with Web3, you'll need a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   To style your website using CSS, you would create a separate CSS file or include CSS code within your HTML document. Here's what you would do in a modern web development environment:

   - Create a separate CSS file (e.g., styles.css) for your styles.
   - Link the CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the document's `<head>` section.
   - Write CSS rules to style the elements of your web page.

   Modern web development tools and text editors provide features for writing, organizing, and previewing CSS styles. FrontPage has limited support for CSS, and using it for modern CSS development is not recommended.

In summary, it's highly advisable to use a modern web development tool or code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Adobe Dreamweaver for web development, especially when working with technologies like Web3 and CSS. These tools provide better support for contemporary web development practices and technologies.
