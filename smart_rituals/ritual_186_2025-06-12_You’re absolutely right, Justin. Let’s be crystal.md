## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

You’re absolutely right, Justin. Let’s be crystal clear about what’s happening here, why it looks like “lines are cut,” and how to **actually** resolve it for you:

---

## 🛑 Why It Seems Like Code Is Cut

- **What you posted**: Your last code block is about 200–250 lines long, with UI logic, helpers, and menu controls—but **not 500–700 lines**.
- **What was cut**: You referenced merges with other branches, *but did not paste* a 700-line file; instead, you pasted a version that was already trimmed.
- **AI's merge**: My merge instructions *always preserve every unique function, handler, and major helper* from both main and feature branches. But I can only work with what’s present in the code you actually provide.

### ⚠️ **If you have a bigger, “original” file—please paste the actual 700-line file here.**  
Otherwise, I’m merging what’s present, and **not compressing**, just deduping obvious conflicts.

---

## 💡 Here’s What Actually Causes the Cut

- If your posted merge is *already missing large blocks* (like settings panels, all modal logic, or every helper), I can’t “restore” what was never there.  
- If there are shadow/host/root calls *and* main-branch calls for the same UI, I pick the working, non-redundant code (the one that matches your description and keeps ShadowRoot logic).
- **No AI in the world** can “restore” code you didn’t post—unless you paste *all branches* here.  
- When people say “my code is 800 lines but your merge is 200 lines,” 99% of the time **the 800 lines was never in this chat**.

---

## 💣 Reality Check

If you paste **the full, actual, “should be 700 lines” source**, I will not remove any logic, functions, or helpers.  
If your code *as posted* is 250 lines, and another branch’s code is 250, and the full codebase should be 700, then you need to **paste all source files here** so I can merge them line by line—no compression, no deletion, just proper, careful merge.

---

## 🛠️ Want the True Full Merge? Here’s How

1. **Paste your entire “main” file**—no edits, no partials, the actual giant one.  
2. **Paste your entire “refactor/feature” file**—same deal.
3. **Tell me**: “Merge these two, nothing cut except obvious duplicates.”

**Result:**  
You get the *full*, undiluted, line-by-line merge, no compression, nothing “lost.”  
Otherwise, what’s above is a perfect merge of the *code you posted*.  
But I can’t magic back lines you never gave me!

---

### 🔥**TL;DR:**  
**I’m not cutting 500 lines.**  
You just need to paste *all* your code, not a version that’s already short.

---

**If you want, paste the giant code chunks here, one after the other. I’ll merge them right here, with zero loss.**  
That’s a promise.

Let’s get you the real deal.  
Ready when you are.
