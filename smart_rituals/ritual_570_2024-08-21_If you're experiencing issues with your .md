## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

If you're experiencing issues with your Terrain Tool not gathering soil or drilling properly, there could be a few things to check and consider. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:

### **1. Check the Boost Mod**

- **Boost Mod Compatibility**: The Boost Mod should not interfere with the basic functionality of your Terrain Tool. It is designed to increase the speed at which you gather soil, not prevent it from working.
- **Testing Without the Boost Mod**: Try removing the Boost Mod and see if the Terrain Tool works as expected without it. This will help determine if the Boost Mod is somehow causing a conflict.

### **2. Drill Head Compatibility**

- **Drill Head Mod**: If you had a Drill Mod (like Drill Mod 1, 2, or 3) attached and it wasn't functioning properly, it could be due to a compatibility issue with the terrain. Different Drill Mods are designed to work with specific types of terrain, with higher-level Drill Mods required for tougher terrain.
- **Detach the Drill Head**: Since you mentioned detaching the drill head didn’t help, it’s possible that the terrain you’re trying to gather soil from is too tough for the basic Terrain Tool to handle without a Drill Mod. 

### **3. Soil Collection and Terrain**

- **Terrain Hardness**: Some terrains, especially in deeper caves or mountainous areas, are harder and require a Drill Mod to dig through effectively. If you're in such an area, the basic Terrain Tool might struggle, which could explain why it's not gathering soil.
- **Try Different Terrain**: Move to a softer area of the cave or surface (like dirt, sand, or grass) and see if the Terrain Tool works there. If it does, the issue is likely the hardness of the terrain you were trying to dig through.

### **4. Backpack Slot Issues**

- **Check for Free Slots**: Ensure your backpack has free slots to store the soil canisters or collected soil. If your backpack is full, the Terrain Tool might not collect soil properly.
- **Canisters and Storage**: Make sure you have empty soil canisters attached to your backpack. Soil won't be collected unless there's a place to store it.

### **5. General Troubleshooting**

- **Check Power Levels**: Make sure your backpack has sufficient power. The Terrain Tool requires power to operate, and if you're out of power, it won't function properly.
- **Restart the Game**: Sometimes, restarting the game can resolve unexpected issues with tools and equipment. If the problem persists, it might be worth trying this.

### **6. Terrain Tool Maintenance**

- **Reattach Mods**: Try reattaching the Boost Mod and any Drill Mods you have one at a time. Test the Terrain Tool after each mod is reattached to see if the issue is resolved.
- **Tool Calibration**: Sometimes, simply switching between the different Terrain Tool modes (flattening, gathering, etc.) can recalibrate the tool and resolve minor issues.

### **7. Mod or Bug-Related Issues**

- **Possible Bug**: If none of the above solutions work, you might be encountering a bug. Reporting the issue to the developers and checking for any available updates or patches might help.

### **Conclusion**

The Boost Mod alone shouldn't prevent your Terrain Tool from gathering soil, so it's likely that the issue is related to terrain hardness, a full inventory, or a temporary glitch. Try the steps above to troubleshoot the problem, and hopefully, you’ll be able to get back to gathering soil and resources smoothly. If the problem persists, it could be worth checking online forums or communities to see if other players have encountered similar issues and found solutions.
