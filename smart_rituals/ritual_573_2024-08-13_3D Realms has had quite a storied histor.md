## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

3D Realms has had quite a storied history, and you're right that their journey has been a bit of a rollercoaster. Let's break it down:

### The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of 3D Realms:

1. **The Golden Era (1987-2009):**
   - **Early Success:** 3D Realms, originally founded as Apogee Software in 1987, was a pioneer in the shareware distribution model. They were best known for classics like *Duke Nukem 3D* (1996) and *Shadow Warrior* (1997).
   - **Duke Nukem Forever:** The companyâ€™s downfall began with the infamous development of *Duke Nukem Forever*, which was announced in 1997 but faced constant delays and development issues.
   - **Closure in 2009:** Due to financial troubles and the prolonged development of *Duke Nukem Forever*, 3D Realms effectively shut down its development studio in 2009, laying off most of its staff.

2. **Acquisition and Revival (2014-Present):**
   - **Acquisition by Interceptor Entertainment:** In 2014, the Danish company Interceptor Entertainment acquired 3D Realms' trademarks and IPs. This marked the beginning of a new era for 3D Realms.
   - **Rebranding and New Projects:** Under new ownership, 3D Realms transitioned from being a game developer to more of a publisher. They started working on and publishing games with a retro flair, harking back to their roots.
   - **New Titles:** 3D Realms has been involved in the production and publishing of several new titles, including *Ion Fury* (2019) and *Graven* (2021), which are inspired by classic first-person shooters.

3. **Current Status:**
   - **Publishing and Development:** Today, 3D Realms continues to publish and develop games, with a focus on titles that evoke the spirit of the '90s shooter era. They're much smaller than in their heyday but have found a niche audience that appreciates their dedication to classic game design.
   - **Legacy and Influence:** Despite their turbulent past, 3D Realms has managed to stay relevant in the industry by leaning into their legacy and catering to fans of retro gaming.

So, while 3D Realms did face significant challenges and effectively ceased to operate as it once did, it never truly disappeared. The company was revived and rebranded, finding a new life in the gaming industry. Their legacy lives on, both in the classic games they produced and in the newer titles they support today.
