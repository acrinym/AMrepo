Well I've been at my current position since 2016 and at the same company for 8 years so that definitely has meaning to me as I did my annual review yesterday and this company in particular helps people by not necessarily focusing on the strengths of people with disabilities but rehabilitating people with disabilities so that they can have a full-time or part-time job and get back into the job market. It's peckham.org I'm shared that with you before, Business services division working on the IT help desk. That is really my most significant job experience but as far as personal achievements.. let's see gotten divorced twice from people who were let's say unsavory, and challenges? Yeah 2023 the very start of it, I left a four-year relationship with four children that weren't mine one of them had moved out anyway but two of them were completely disobedient and did not listen and the girl I was with was completely lazy didn't do anything had no ambitions in life that would help at all. I thought this would change over time and I gave her 4 years and it didn't I was the most miserable I've ever been. No self-help could change that for me. Allegedly she's different now and with a different guy but I believe it when I see it which I will never do so for now I don't believe that

Justin enjoys activities involving computers, such as using FL Studio to make music, assembling computers, gardening, spending time outside, reading, learning about electroculture and Orgone, and working on his NLP hypnosis life coach certification. He also likes learning new things about NLP hypnosis and life coaching. Justin is extremely passionate about gardening, making music, and helping people in various ways. He is also passionate about alternative medicine and cures. While electronics are less of a focus, FL Studio remains a big interest. If he had to pick one passion, it would be learning about the mind, including NLP hypnosis, life coaching, and self-development topics like the law of attraction and Kevin Trudeau's teachings. Justin constantly reads about or researches topics related to Tartaria, past civilizations, suppressed information, and self-help/development. Justin finds the following types of tasks or projects most fulfilling, ranked in order of preference: 1. Learning a self-development skill/technique and successfully implementing it in his life and others' lives. 2. Personal projects such as musical ideas and programming learning. 3. Landscaping and related activities where he can let his creativity show. Justin feels he is strongest in skills related to learning, reading, processing information, and coming up with new ideas. He is also strong in gardening and self-help, including alternative medicine. Justin does not generally receive compliments or recognition except from his fiancée. He joined the Global Information Network for this reason. Justin knows a lot about natural healing and cures, and he can come up with various ideas, especially those involving alternative energy or gardening. At work, Justin might ask for help from a senior agent, management official, or the help desk, while at home, he generally works on tasks or issues that need to be solved. The values most important to Justin are understanding the truth about humanity's purpose and meaning in life, and in his professional life, retaining professionalism while being social. Justin is primarily motivated by finances at his current job at the Forest Service Help Desk/Customer Help Desk. He prefers working with others but prefers to work alone if high-intensity focus is required and he has all the necessary information. Justin thrives in very structured or flexible work environments. He prefers routine but also values the option of flexible work times. He finds that self-imposed pressure helps him get things done more easily and quickly. Justin's significant past experiences include working at his current position at Peckham, Inc. for 8 years, where he feels his work has meaning due to the organization's mission of helping people with disabilities. He also experienced personal challenges, such as leaving a four-year relationship at the start of 2023. Justin felt particularly successful or proud of his work when he participated in "Shark Tank" at work, suggested ideas, and created a comprehensive OneNote notebook. He also enjoyed organizing the warehouse at a past job. Justin's long-term career goal is to create his own help desk or work somewhere where his contributions feel more valuable. He is drawn to industries such as AI, music production, gardening, greenhouse and landscaping, time and resource management, office management, and mental well-being assistance using NLP, hypnosis, and life coaching. Justin wants to leave a legacy of valuable contributions to the organizations he belongs to, with his work being recognized and utilized by others. He envisions an ideal work-life balance where he can work when he wants. Justin prefers a flexible remote work schedule, ideally working from 7:00 to 3:00. He desires an income of 80k or more. Geographical location is not a significant factor for him at the moment. He values job security, which is one of the reasons he has remained at his current job for so long.
