## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

It seems there aren’t many specific “spells” in the magical sense explicitly aimed at cockroaches. However, if you're open to blending intention-based practices with practical action, you could create your own pest-repelling spell. Here’s an idea:

### DIY Cockroach Repelling Spell
1. **Gather Materials**: 
   - A small jar or container
   - Dried herbs like bay leaves, mint, or lavender (traditionally used for protection and repelling)
   - Black salt or sea salt (for banishment and purification)
   - A white or black candle
   - A piece of paper and pen

2. **Set Your Intention**:
   - Write down your intention on the paper (e.g., "No cockroaches may enter my space, and those here must leave immediately").
   - Fold the paper and place it in the jar.

3. **Create the Mixture**:
   - Add the herbs and salt to the jar while focusing on your intention. Visualize your space as clean, protected, and pest-free.

4. **Seal the Spell**:
   - Light the candle and let a few drops of wax seal the jar. Say words of banishment, like:
     “By this seal, I claim my space. No pest or roach may take its place. Be gone, I say, this spell is done. My home is safe, pest-free for everyone.”

5. **Placement**:
   - Place the jar in a central or problematic area to “guard” your home.

If this approach resonates with you, it blends a bit of magical thinking with practical pest deterrents. Let me know if you want something more specific!

While specific voodoo or black magic spells targeting cockroaches are scarce, various folk magic traditions offer rituals aimed at repelling pests. Here's a ritual inspired by such practices:

   *"Creatures of shadow, heed my plea,  
   Depart my space, so mote it be."*

6. **Dispose of the Jar**: Bury the sealed jar far from your home, preferably in a busy area where disturbances are frequent, to prevent the return of the pests.
