If you're looking for songs by Prince, Queen, and Michael Jackson to convey your feelings about leaving Nina, focusing on themes of personal growth, self-discovery, and the difficulty of making tough decisions, here are some powerful options:

---

### **Prince**
1. **"Purple Rain"**
   - Themes: Letting go, transformation, and emotional expression.
   - Message: This song captures the bittersweet emotions of leaving someone you care about. The lyric *“I never meant to cause you any sorrow, I never meant to cause you any pain”* reflects deep remorse but also acceptance of the need to move forward.

2. **"When Doves Cry"**
   - Themes: Emotional complexity, separation, and self-reflection.
   - Message: It highlights the challenges of a relationship that’s no longer fulfilling, with lines like *“This is what it sounds like when doves cry”* conveying the sorrow of parting ways.

3. **"Sign o' the Times"**
   - Themes: Facing reality, societal and personal shifts.
   - Message: You could draw on the song's deeper meaning about the need for change when circumstances become unsustainable.

4. **"Free"**
   - Themes: Independence and self-liberation.
   - Message: A direct anthem of personal freedom, this song emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself.

### **Queen**
1. **"I Want to Break Free"**
   - Themes: Liberation and self-empowerment.
   - Message: This song’s bold declaration of freedom resonates with someone taking a step toward independence. Lyrics like *“I’ve fallen in love, I’ve fallen in love for the first time”* could metaphorically represent self-love or rediscovery.

2. **"The Show Must Go On"**
   - Themes: Resilience, determination, and moving forward.
   - Message: This song acknowledges the pain of change but focuses on the strength to keep going: *“My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies, fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die.”*

3. **"Somebody to Love"**
   - Themes: Longing, self-reflection, and searching for fulfillment.
   - Message: Reflecting on the need for deeper connections and emotional satisfaction, this could subtly underscore why the relationship isn’t working.

4. **"Love of My Life"**
   - Themes: Deep affection and regret.
   - Message: Although this is a love song, it could express gratitude for the love shared while acknowledging the necessity of parting.

### **Michael Jackson**
1. **"Man in the Mirror"**
   - Themes: Self-reflection and personal change.
   - Message: A perfect anthem for making tough decisions, this song’s message of looking within and making a change aligns with the process of self-improvement: *“If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change.”*

2. **"You Are Not Alone"**
   - Themes: Compassion and emotional support.
   - Message: This could express your intention to leave while reassuring Nina that she’s not entirely abandoned: *“Though you're far away, I am here to stay.”*

3. **"Leave Me Alone"**
   - Themes: Reclaiming space and independence.
   - Message: This song is more assertive and could emphasize your need to be free, though it might come across as more confrontational.

4. **"Heal the World"**
   - Themes: Love, healing, and peace.
   - Message: Though written for a broader context, it could serve as a metaphor for finding peace within yourself and in the world, a theme tied to your reasons for leaving.

### **Suggested Approach**
- Pair the songs with a heartfelt explanation. For example, *"Purple Rain"* or *"Man in the Mirror"* can convey your emotional turmoil and the importance of self-growth.
- Create a playlist for Nina with a note explaining the significance of each song. This allows her to reflect on the emotions and reasoning behind your decision.

These songs are rich in meaning and emotion, making them excellent tools to convey your message delicately and powerfully.
