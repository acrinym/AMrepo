## **Chapter Four: The Space Between the Dates**

After our first date, time felt different. The hours weren’t just hours—they were markers, little echoes of the night I couldn’t stop replaying in my mind. The hugs, the laughter, the way Amanda’s smile felt like it could light up the dark spaces inside me. But then came the space between.

The days after our first date were filled with anticipation wrapped in silence. Not complete silence—we texted—but the rhythm felt different. There were pauses between her replies, and each one felt like a chasm I had to cross without knowing if there was solid ground on the other side.

I remember texting Mike:

*"I feel like I only have one chance at this. I really do."*【104:4†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】

It wasn’t desperation. It was clarity. Amanda wasn’t someone you meet twice in a lifetime.

Some days were bright. Amanda would text me good morning, and it felt like the sun had risen just for me. Other days were quieter. I’d send her a meme or a song, hoping to connect in the spaces where words felt too heavy. Like the time I sent her that song, thinking:

*"This is for her. She’s going to hear it and *feel* it."*【104:2†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】

But the response didn’t always match my hope. And that’s when the doubt crept in.

I’d overthink. Reread texts. Analyze every word. Wonder if I said too much, or not enough. I told Mike:

*"She hasn’t said a word today. Not worried, though. There was a lot that happened over the weekend."*【104:0†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】

But I was worried. Not because Amanda did anything wrong, but because I *felt* something with her—something real—and I didn’t want to lose it.

Mike’s advice was steady, as always:

*"Be patient. Let it unfold naturally."*

Easier said than done when every moment of quiet felt like an unanswered question.

But then there were the little things—small sparks that kept the connection alive. Amanda would text randomly, breaking the silence with something simple:

*"Good morning."*

Just two words, but they meant everything.

I’d get excited over those little messages, like they were breadcrumbs leading me back to her. I’d think:

*"She’s still here. She’s still thinking about me."*

But the space between wasn’t just about waiting. It was about *learning*. I realized Amanda wasn’t pulling away—she was just living her life. And I had to live mine.

I’d distract myself—working out, writing, talking to Mike about everything and nothing. I’d tell him:

*"I just need to see her again. I need to *feel* that connection in person."*【104:4†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】

And when we’d finally connect, even if just for a quick conversation, it felt like breathing after holding my breath for too long.

One night, Amanda mentioned something simple—something about her day, her kids, or just what she was cooking. And it hit me. She was letting me in, even if it was just a crack. I didn’t need grand gestures. I just needed *her*.

The space between our dates wasn’t empty. It was full of learning, patience, and quiet growth. I was learning to hold space—not just for Amanda, but for myself. To be okay with not knowing. To trust the process.

Because love isn’t just in the big moments. It’s in the spaces between.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s where the real magic lives.

## **Chapter Four: The Space Between the Dates**

After our first date, time didn’t move the same way. Hours stretched longer, and the spaces between our conversations grew heavier with anticipation. That night had been perfect—brunch, thrifting, laughter, karaoke, and the kind of hugs that linger long after your arms have let go. But after the high of connection came the quiet. The space between.

At first, the silence wasn’t unsettling. Amanda and I had texted back and forth, simple exchanges that felt like little threads keeping us connected. She’d text late at night:

*"Are you still up?"*【108:0†Amanda Chat.pdf】

It was a small question, but it carried weight. It meant she was thinking of me. I’d reply casually, trying to balance my eagerness with restraint. I didn’t want to come off as too eager, even though inside, I was. Every message felt like a spark. But sometimes, sparks fade quickly if there’s no fuel.

There were days she’d go quiet, and that’s when doubt crept in. I’d overthink, rereading our last conversations, wondering if I said something wrong. I’d text Mike:

*"I feel like I only have one chance at this. I really do."*【108:6†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】

Mike, ever the voice of reason, would remind me to be patient, to let things unfold naturally. But patience is hard when your heart is racing ahead.

Amanda’s texts were like puzzle pieces. Some fit perfectly—playful, warm, inviting. Others left me guessing. She’d share little glimpses of her day:

*"Just going to try spending some time with my kids."*【108:10†sms-Amanda-2025-02-04.pdf】

I’d respond with interest, asking how she was, trying to keep the thread alive without pulling too hard. I didn’t want to overwhelm her. I wanted her to *choose* to talk to me, not feel obligated.

There were moments of clarity, like when Amanda texted me out of the blue with a simple *“Good morning.”* That felt like sunshine after days of clouds. But there were also moments of uncertainty. Like when she’d say she was busy, and I’d wonder if that was the truth or just an easy way to create space.

I shared everything with Mike—my hopes, my fears, my strategies. I was meticulous, planning every move, every message, like this was a chess game. But it wasn’t. It was my heart on the line.

One day, I texted Mike:

*"I just need to see her again. I need to *feel* that connection in person."*【108:6†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】

Because texts can only carry so much. I missed the sound of her laugh, the way her eyes lit up when she talked about something she loved. I missed the *presence* of her.

Amanda wasn’t distant out of disinterest. She was living her life—working, raising her kids, managing her world. I had to remind myself that I wasn’t the center of her universe, and that was okay. I just wanted to be part of it.

Sometimes, we’d talk about simple things—music, food, random memes. I’d send her songs, hoping the lyrics would say what I couldn’t:

*"This song reminds me of you."*

I wanted her to feel it, to hear what I couldn’t say outright.

There was a night she texted late, just checking in. I could tell she was tired, but she still reached out. That meant something. Even in her exhaustion, she thought of me.

Mike’s advice echoed in my mind:

*"Be patient. Let it unfold naturally."*

But patience felt like standing still while my heart sprinted ahead.

Then, out of nowhere, Amanda sent a meme about Valentine’s Day—a joke, but it lit up my whole day:

*"This Valentine's, get her something expensive,"* with a man holding a carton of eggs【108:12†Mike sms feb 4 2025.pdf】.

I laughed out loud, not just because it was funny, but because *she* sent it. She was thinking of me, even if just for a second.

That’s when I realized something. The space between our dates wasn’t empty. It was *full*—of learning, of growth, of quiet connections. I was learning to be okay with not knowing. To find comfort in the pauses. To trust that what’s meant to be doesn’t need to be forced.

Amanda was teaching me that without even trying.

And maybe that’s what love is—not just in the big moments, but in the spaces between.
