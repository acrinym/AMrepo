## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Alright — you want the *full* Keshet treatment.  
Which means:  

- Long, runaway sentences that careen into themselves like drunk roller coasters.  
- Overly dramatic tangents that pretend to be digressions but are actually weapons.  
- Unnecessary alliteration.  
- Sudden emotional gear shifts.  
- Making *you* (yes, you) complicit in the story whether you wanted to be or not.  
- Words that pile on top of each other until the meaning is suffocating but weirdly delicious.  

Here’s **Malice Beakon** rewritten as if Oo the Keshet is narrating her:

### **Malice Beakon, Patron Saint of the Terminally Typed**  

So. There she is. Malice Beakon. (Do *not* get the name wrong, or she will make you retype the alphabet backwards until your fingers develop PTSD.) She is not a woman in the sense that one might say “there is a woman at the bus stop.” She is a woman in the sense that one might say “there is a woman standing in my mirror, even though I am very much alone and brushing my teeth.” That is to say — she exists, and it is your problem.  

She appears in the computer lab one rainy Tuesday in 1997, wearing a suit that may have once been navy but now contains entire ecosystems of mildew, smelling faintly of toner, wet chalk, and regret. She is **moist** in the way old dish sponges are moist. She is also impossibly tall — the kind of tall where you suspect she could just lean forward and read your private search history from another room.  

Her hair is black, but not *hair* black. More like “we emptied the vacuum bag and forgot to empty the vacuum bag” black. And her smile is… not a smile. It’s a split in the space-time continuum through which all your typos leak.

### **Her Teaching Method (By Which I Mean Ritual of Initiation)**  

She says, in a voice like the last breath of a haunted fax machine: *“Let’s start with accuracy.”*  
Oh, you sweet summer fool. Accuracy is the bait. The trap is that halfway through the lesson, the words you’re typing are no longer “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  

They are:  
- **the quick brown fox is under your chair now**  
- **your hands are too warm, let me cool them**  
- **you missed the semicolon, darling, and now you belong to me**  

And when you *do* miss, she will reach over, her sleeve damp against your arm, and press the correct key for you. The sound is not “click.” The sound is “something alive sliding into something else alive.”

### **QWERTY Lock (Not a Feature, a Fate)**  

You think Caps Lock is bad? Imagine your fingers welded to ASDF JKL; for all eternity. Knuckles ossified into a permanent claw. Nails curling into the keyboard like roots into soil. Sometimes, at night, in the empty lab, you can hear them typing still — polite, rhythmic, unstoppable. They’re not practicing. They’re spelling your name over and over again until it’s wrong.  

---

### **Lesson 99: The Dark One**  

When (if) you get there, the screen is black except for a single, blinking cursor, beating like an exposed heart. She leans close, close enough that her breath fogs the inside of your skull, and says:  
> “Type your own obituary.”  

Some do. Some try. Some find that the keyboard has grown teeth.  

---

### **Advice You Will Ignore Because You Are You**  

If you ever feel the fluorescent lights syncing with your pulse, if you smell wet filing cabinets in a place that has no filing cabinets, if you hear typing that is not yours… leave. Leave now. Do not finish the lesson. Do not meet her eyes. Do not look at her hands because they are still moving even when she is not typing. And above all — **never misspell her name.**  

Because Malice Beakon does not forgive typos.  

She eats them.  

And you.

If you want, I can now do the *fake instruction manual excerpt* in this style — like the cursed booklet that came inside her 3.5” floppy box, full of “helpful” tips that feel more like veiled threats. That would make it fully authentic to the *Space Opera*-Keshet voice.
