## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Since you are working on Windows and want to avoid setting up WSL, you can still solve the issues natively. Here are the Windows-specific steps to address your problems:

### 1. **Install Rust on Windows**
Since you're running into the Rust requirement for compiling packages like `safetensors`, you'll need to install Rust for Windows. Here’s how to do it natively:

1. **Install Rust via Rustup** (the official Rust installer for Windows):

   - Open a web browser and go to [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).
   - Download the installer by following the instructions. Rustup will handle everything for you, including installing Cargo (Rust's package manager).
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts.

2. Once installation is complete, verify that Rust is installed by running this command in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   rustc --version
   ```

   This should return the version of Rust, confirming that it's installed correctly.

3. Restart your PowerShell session or add Rust to your system’s PATH if necessary.

### 2. **Install Python Packages Again**
Once Rust is installed, you can proceed with installing the Python packages that require Rust for compilation:

1. Try installing `transformers` and its dependencies again:

   ```powershell
   pip install transformers
   ```

2. Install other necessary packages (such as `llama` and `torch`) one by one:

   - For `torch`: Check the official PyTorch website for the appropriate installation command for your specific version of Python and CUDA (if you have GPU support). The command to install `torch` on Windows without CUDA would look something like this:

     ```powershell
     pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
     ```

     If you need CUDA support for GPU acceleration, you can use the appropriate index URL from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

3. If `llama` still gives you issues after Rust installation, check if it has a precompiled Windows wheel available. If it doesn't, compiling from source might be required, but Rust should handle that after installation.

### 3. **Dealing with Python 3.13 Compatibility**
You may also face issues because not all packages fully support Python 3.13 yet. If you continue encountering issues with certain libraries, I recommend using a slightly older Python version, such as Python 3.11 or 3.12, as a workaround until full support is available. You can install another version of Python alongside your current installation and use a version manager like `pyenv-win` to manage multiple versions on Windows.

Here’s how to install `pyenv-win`:

1. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges and run the following commands to install `pyenv-win`:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://pyenv-win.github.io/pyenv-win/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
   ```

2. Once installed, you can install Python 3.11 (or another version) using `pyenv`:

   ```powershell
   pyenv install 3.11.5
   pyenv global 3.11.5
   ```

3. After setting the desired version globally, install the necessary libraries (e.g., `torch`, `llama`, etc.).

### 4. **Use Pre-built Wheels for PyTorch**
For `torch`, you can also directly download pre-built wheels for Python from the official PyTorch website if the `pip` installation gives you trouble. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
2. Select the appropriate version of Python (such as 3.11) and the preferred configuration (e.g., CPU or CUDA support).
3. Follow the command that PyTorch provides for installing via pip, for example:

   ```powershell
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```
