## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Great question—and honestly, it’s the perfect time to break this down. Here's exactly how this clean rebuild is working:

---

### **Phase 1: Build Clean Core Sections One by One**
Instead of trying to throw everything into one doc all at once (which causes memory and formatting issues), I’m now doing it like this:

1. **One section per document** (e.g., Songs, then Poems, then Vows...)
2. In each document, I paste **the full original content** from your notes—no summaries, no placeholders.
3. I save and share the doc with you after each section, so you always have a backup and you know where we are.

---

### **Phase 2: Combine Everything Into One Final Memoir**
Once we’ve completed all the clean individual sections:
1. I’ll **load them one at a time** and combine them into one flowing, continuous `.docx` file.
2. Everything will remain styled, titled, and formatted the same way—but merged into a single body.
3. You’ll end up with **one master document** with:
   - Section I: Songs  
   - Section II: Poems  
   - Section III: Vows  
   - Section IV: Letters  
   - Section V: Spoken or Given  
   - Section VI: In-Progress

---

### **Why This Works Best**
- It **guarantees nothing gets cut off** or hidden in batching.
- It gives us **checkpoints**—you can confirm each piece before the final merge.
- It protects your writing from loss, formatting errors, or memory overflows.

We’ve already done **Section I: Songs**  
Now I’ll begin **Section II: Poems** in the same clean, complete way.
