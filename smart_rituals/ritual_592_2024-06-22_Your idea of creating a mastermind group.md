Your idea of creating a mastermind group focused on success, self-mastery, and achievement is fantastic. It aligns well with your interests and can help you build a community of like-minded individuals. Here are some steps and tips to help you get started:

1. **Define Your Vision and Goals**:
   - Clearly outline what you want to achieve with this mastermind group. What are the main topics and themes you want to focus on?
   - Set specific goals for each meeting, such as discussing a particular book, sharing business ideas, or exploring investment opportunities.

2. **Identify Your Target Audience**:
   - Determine who you want to invite to your group. This could include friends, colleagues, or people from online communities who share similar interests.
   - Use social media platforms and forums to reach out to potential members. Highlight the benefits of joining your group.

3. **Choose the Right Format**:
   - Decide whether you want to hold in-person meetings or virtual ones. Given your remote location, virtual meetings might be more feasible.
   - Choose a platform for virtual meetings, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet.

4. **Create a Schedule**:
   - Set a regular schedule for your meetings, whether it’s once a month or twice a month.
   - Choose a day and time that works for most members, and stick to it to establish consistency.

5. **Plan Your Meetings**:
   - Prepare an agenda for each meeting. Include time for sharing knowledge, discussing specific topics, and open discussions.
   - Assign different members to present or lead discussions on various topics to encourage participation.

6. **Share Resources**:
   - Create a shared folder or platform where members can access books, audios, videos, and other resources.
   - Encourage members to share their own resources and insights.

7. **Engage and Motivate Members**:
   - Foster a supportive and collaborative environment where members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and experiences.
   - Recognize and celebrate achievements and milestones within the group.

8. **Consider Inviting Guest Speakers**:
   - While it may be challenging to attract wealthy individuals without compensation, you can start by inviting local business owners, entrepreneurs, or experts in your network.
   - As your group grows, you might attract more prominent speakers who see the value in sharing their knowledge.

9. **Promote Your Group**:
   - Use social media, community boards, and local events to promote your mastermind group.
   - Share testimonials and success stories from your meetings to attract more members.

10. **Evaluate and Improve**:
    - Regularly seek feedback from your members to understand what’s working and what needs improvement.
    - Adapt your meetings and topics based on the interests and needs of your group.

Starting and nurturing a mastermind group can be incredibly rewarding and can help you and others achieve personal and professional growth. Good luck with your initiative!

Given your preference for in-person meetings to facilitate better energy transmission, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Local Outreach**:
   - Start by reaching out to your immediate network. Invite friends, family, and acquaintances who might be interested in your mastermind group.
   - Utilize community boards, local business networks, and social media to promote your group. Websites like Meetup.com can help you find local individuals with similar interests.

2. **Partner with Local Venues**:
   - Look for local cafes, libraries, community centers, or co-working spaces that might be willing to host your meetings. Some venues might offer free or discounted rates for regular group meetings.
   - Establish a regular meeting place to build consistency and familiarity among members.

3. **Host a Launch Event**:
   - Organize a launch event to introduce your mastermind group and its goals. This can help attract initial members and generate interest.
   - Provide an overview of the topics you’ll cover, share some of your insights, and encourage attendees to bring their friends or colleagues.

4. **Leverage Existing Networks**:
   - If you have connections within the Kevin Trudeau fan club or the Global Information Network, see if they can help you spread the word about your group.
   - Collaborate with local self-help or business development groups to cross-promote your mastermind sessions.

5. **Focus on Quality Over Quantity**:
   - It’s better to start with a small, committed group rather than trying to attract a large number of attendees initially. Quality discussions and strong connections will lead to organic growth over time.
   - Foster a sense of exclusivity and value in your group to attract serious and dedicated members.

6. **Provide Value from the Start**:
   - At each meeting, ensure there is valuable content and actionable insights. This will keep members engaged and encourage them to return and bring others.
   - Incorporate different formats, such as guest speakers, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to keep the meetings dynamic and interesting.

7. **Offer Flexible Meeting Times**:
   - Consider offering multiple meeting times (e.g., one in the morning and one in the evening) to accommodate different schedules. This flexibility can help attract a broader range of participants.

8. **Build a Supportive Community**:
   - Create a welcoming and supportive atmosphere where members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and experiences.
   - Encourage networking and collaboration among members outside of the regular meetings.

By focusing on these strategies, you can successfully establish and grow your in-person mastermind group, even in a remote location.
