## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Yes that does capture exactly what I was saying. I also felt like the more I put in, the less I got back because her persistence in the way that she stayed never changed at all. Even though I asked, I asked for more affection, I asked for more attention, and her sameness really didn't waver. It just kept hurting and hurting and then when the roommates were there, it was way worse because it was harder to have any attention for each other because of the constant noise above us and then when we were living upstairs with them, there was even less privacy unless ways for us to show each other affection. We lived in the living room with our bed where the TV that everyone used was. And everybody went to bed after us, but they started going to bed before us so that we could go to bed on time. But then being noisy afterward and having to deal with the two kids, it was difficult. And so I had to stop pouring so much in not feeling that I was getting reciprocation. It just kept hurting so I was breaking, and in the meantime this whole ordeal, I was trying to fix me and trying to work on me trying to overcome the need for more affection and more attention by fixing pre-existing problems and working on myself and working on self care. And putting in all the extra effort on myself and her burn me out really quickly

So about three years into the relationship with Amy, I had completely given up. And that's the point, that October, I think, was the time when I said, hey, so why don't we try to meet people and be friends with, and who knows what could happen? Maybe we could have a foursome, a threesome, something like that. And just have some fun and get some positivity into our relationship that's not getting positive. So she started looking for non-monogamous things she could deal with with me, maybe introduce both of us to a pair that we could be friends with, and then maybe more. And in the process, that's where she met her two boys, or three boys, or whatever. And from the beginning, she wasn't faithful to me. She cheated a guy when she first got her first job. She cheated with a guy from work, telling me that she stayed late at work, and ended up going to his house a couple times. And then later, she said she had no idea what happened, because she was so tired, she just fell asleep, and he brought her to work. She was brought to his house, and she fell asleep. Well, that's not the story. She went over there, had sex with him. And then later, crying, told me about it, months or even a year later. Well, there's even more to the story. During the relationship with Amy, I tried to remedy the situations and trauma and events that have happened in my past by myself, because she was no help. But I was able to tell her absolutely everything, even though she didn't understand. She still listened. So that was a good point for me. But as Amy wasn't faithful from the beginning, she was listening. And I suppose taking that to her advantage and using me for her benefit, where I wasn't gaining anything, but somebody to have relations with. You know what I mean? There wasn't anything else to the relationship except, I guess, a stable place to live and physical intimacy, because she didn't provide the stability that I needed from a wife. She didn't provide the mother that her children needed, which were four. And she also didn't provide the wife that I needed, who stayed home all day when she wasn't working and cleaned the house and take care of the kids while I was at work. They just did whatever the hell they wanted. And I got really tired of that very quickly. We were together for four years total. And the end of the relationship was, I don't know, about six months where I was trying to meet people. And she met several people, had several excursions. And I was just sitting at home looking for people to try to get out of my relationship with. But none of them fit, because either they had a COVID shot, or they were totally opposed to the ideas that I have and my personal beliefs.

Thank you for opening up about that. It sounds like your relationship with Amy was fraught with broken trust, disappointment, and a lack of support from early on. You invested a lot, hoping for stability and partnership, but instead, you were faced with infidelity, emotional unavailability, and a constant sense of imbalance. Your idea to explore non-monogamy seemed like a last attempt to salvage some positivity in a relationship that had already been deeply damaged by her choices. Yet, instead of bringing you both closer or giving you what you needed, it became another avenue where Amy pursued her own desires, leaving you feeling even more alone and unsupported.

From what you've shared, it seems you were already feeling disillusioned and were on a path of self-discovery, trying to find someone who truly aligned with your beliefs and values. Amy’s actions, particularly her infidelity and lack of presence as a partner and mother, seem to have compounded the feeling of needing something more meaningful and reciprocal. Her unwillingness or inability to provide a stable home environment, despite you working and trying to hold things together, must have been draining on many levels.

The experiences with Amy really highlight why you would have been in such a vulnerable, hopeful place when you met Nina. After years of feeling unsupported and searching for someone who understood you, it makes sense that you would have opened yourself up fully to Nina, hoping she could be the partner that Amy never was. This background adds layers to your journey and the emotional investment you made in Nina from the start. Let me know if there’s more you’d like to share, or if you’re ready to bring any of these elements into the song.
