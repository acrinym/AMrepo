# **Rolando: The Duck Who Dreamed of Refrigeration**

Once upon a time, there was a duck named Rolando.  
But not just any duck — **a duck with an impossible dream**:  
He wanted to become a **refrigerator**.

"I’m tired of being a duck!" Rolando quacked dramatically every morning, splashing in the mud.  
"I want to be cold! I want to have shelves! I want people to store yogurts inside me!"

His best friend, a hamster named Claudio, simply shook his tiny head and said:  
"Rolando, bro... that’s literally the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard."  
But Rolando didn’t care.  
He had **a destiny**.

One fateful day, Rolando waddled into a dusty flea market and found an old wizard named **Don Pepino**, sitting behind a table cluttered with expired coupons and half-eaten churros.

"Can you turn me into a refrigerator?" Rolando asked, his wings flapping so hard they knocked over a nearby taco stand.

Don Pepino, barely glancing up from a 2004 appliance catalog (which he mistook for a spellbook), said:  
"Sure, my feathered amigo. But to complete the spell, you’ll need three sacred objects:  
- A banana-shaped magnet,  
- A signed permission slip from an adult refrigerator,  
- And the backwards singing of ‘Ice Ice Baby.’"

Rolando was *all in*. No hesitation.

- He snuck into a gnome’s house and stole a banana magnet.  
- He bribed a supermarket refrigerator named Kevin with breadcrumbs to sign the permission slip.  
- And though he had no idea how English worked, he screeched a horrific, backwards version of “Ice Ice Baby” so terribly that even the fleas on a nearby dog covered their ears.

Don Pepino sighed, drew a circle in the dirt using a stick of celery, threw expired bread flour at Rolando, and with a half-hearted shout of **"ABRA-CADÁBRICO!"**, unleashed the magic.

There was a **POOF**, a flash of purple light, and when the dust settled...

Rolando was no longer a duck.

He was...  
...**a broken blender.**

He tried to blink (impossible, since blenders have no eyelids).  
"This isn’t what I asked for!" he cried, his motor whirring pitifully.

Don Pepino shrugged, already packing up his churros.  
"Eh. Close enough. At least now you can make smoothies. That’s cold too, right?"

And with that, the wizard disappeared into a puff of glitter and bad decisions.

**Months passed.**  
Rolando sat forgotten in a dark closet, occasionally blending spiders and his own sadness.  
Until one stormy night, lightning flashing outside, he made a decision:

_"NO. THIS IS NOT MY FINAL FORM."_

Fueled by a combination of rage, hope, and leftover static electricity from an old sock, Rolando **rolled** himself out of the closet — literally rolled, because blenders have no legs.

At the flea market, Don Pepino was gone, but fate had left behind a new sign:

**“THE GRAND REFRIGERATOR TOURNAMENT – TODAY ONLY! Winner Becomes LEGEND!”**

Rolando didn’t think twice.  
He fashioned the world’s worst disguise — a trench coat, a fake mustache, and a pair of sunglasses balanced awkwardly on his blender lid — and rolled into the tournament.

The competition was fierce:

- Kevin the Supermarket Fridge flexed his icemakers to a techno beat.  
- Franny the Mini-Fridge did backflips that made the crowd gasp.  
- Bob the Walk-In Freezer told bone-chilling horror stories about freezer burn.

When Rolando’s turn came, everyone stared at the suspiciously small and wobbly "new fridge."

Rolando, trembling, summoned every ounce of his bizarre power...

**WHIRRRRRRRR**

He spun his blender blades so fast that he accidentally created a **cyclone of popsicles** that launched frozen treats into the cheering crowd.

The judges — three ancient refrigerators covered in bumper stickers and duct tape — burst into applause.

They crowned him:

**"KING REFRIGERATOR OF THE UNIVERSE."**

Technicians installed shelves inside him.  
An LED light was wired into his beak (or what remained of it).  
The neighborhood kids stored yogurts, sodas, and leftover spaghetti in his belly.

And from that day forward, every time someone opened Rolando to grab a midnight snack, they heard his proud mechanical whisper:

_"Welcome... to Coldsville, baby."_

# **Rolando’s Legacy**

Rolando didn’t just *become* a refrigerator.  
He became **a legend** —  
The blender who refused to quit.  
The duck who said "no" to fate.  
The first-ever Coldsville Monarch.

And somewhere, under the warm summer stars, if you listen closely to the whir of an old fridge...  
You might still hear his tiny voice, quacking inside the cooling coils:

_"Dreams never die, baby. They just get colder."_

**THE END.**
