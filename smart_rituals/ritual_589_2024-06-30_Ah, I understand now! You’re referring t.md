## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Ah, I understand now! You’re referring to the in-game item called a "Clock" that you craft with four gold ingots and one redstone dust. Here’s what you can do with it:

### Crafting a Clock

To craft a clock, you'll need:

- **4 Gold Ingots**
- **1 Redstone Dust**

**Crafting Recipe:**

Place the items in the crafting table as follows:

```
[G] [R] [G]
[G] [   ] [G]
```

Where `[G]` is a gold ingot and `[R]` is redstone dust.

### Using a Clock

A clock in Minecraft shows the in-game time and helps you determine whether it is day or night while you’re underground or away from the surface.

**How to Use a Clock:**

1. **Hold the Clock:**
   - Place the clock in your hotbar and select it to hold it in your hand.

2. **Check the Time:**
   - While holding the clock, look at the clock face. The position of the sun and moon indicators will show you the current time of day or night.
   - If the background is yellow, it's daytime. If it's blue, it's nighttime.

### Reading the Clock:

- **Daytime:** The clock will show a yellow sun symbol moving from left to right across the top half of the clock.
- **Nighttime:** The clock will show a blue moon symbol moving from left to right across the bottom half of the clock.
- **Dawn and Dusk:** The transitions between day and night will be shown as the sun or moon symbols moving near the horizontal midpoint of the clock.

### Practical Uses of a Clock:

1. **Mining and Exploring Underground:**
   - Knowing the time of day can help you plan your trips to the surface, ensuring you avoid hostile mobs at night.
  
2. **Avoiding Mobs:**
   - Use the clock to determine when it is safe to venture outside or to plan your return trip to your base.

3. **Building Projects:**
   - If you’re working on large builds and want to avoid being interrupted by mobs, use the clock to know when to light up the area or seek shelter.

4. **Planning Activities:**
   - Timing your activities based on the in-game day/night cycle can make your gameplay more efficient and safe.

Clocks are handy for players who spend a lot of time underground or in places where the sky isn't visible. They help you stay aware of the time without constantly going to the surface.

Sure, here's a detailed, linear explanation on how to build a portable tree chopper using the Create mod, step-by-step:

### Materials Needed:
- Mechanical Saw (Create mod)
- Mechanical Bearing (Create mod)
- Linear Chassis (Create mod)
- Super Glue (Create mod)
- Portable Storage Interface (Create mod)
- Chests or Barrels
- Water Wheel / Windmill Bearing / other power source (Create mod)
- Cogwheels and Shafts (Create mod)
- Building blocks (for structure)
- Hoppers (for collection)

### Steps to Build the Portable Tree Chopper:

#### 1. **Set Up the Mechanical Saw:**
1. **Place the Mechanical Bearing:**
   - Place a mechanical bearing on the ground where you want the base of your tree chopper to be. This bearing will allow the entire structure to rotate.

2. **Attach the Linear Chassis:**
   - Attach a linear chassis block directly on top of the mechanical bearing. The chassis will hold the mechanical saw and other components.

3. **Extend the Chassis:**
   - Place additional linear chassis blocks horizontally from the initial chassis block. For example, place two more chassis blocks extending from the first one to create a longer arm for chopping.

4. **Place the Mechanical Saw:**
   - Attach a mechanical saw to the end of the linear chassis. Use super glue to ensure the saw is firmly attached.

#### 2. **Build the Power Source:**
1. **Place the Water Wheel or Windmill:**
   - Place a water wheel or windmill bearing near the mechanical bearing. This will provide the rotational power needed to operate the saw.

2. **Connect the Power Source:**
   - Use shafts and cogwheels to connect the water wheel or windmill to the mechanical bearing. This connection will transfer the rotational power from the power source to the bearing.

#### 3. **Set Up Storage and Collection:**
1. **Attach the Portable Storage Interface:**
   - Attach a portable storage interface to the chassis, preferably near the mechanical saw. This interface will transfer collected logs to a storage system.

2. **Set Up the Receiving Storage:**
   - Place a chest or barrel near the working area.
   - Attach a second portable storage interface to the chest or barrel. Ensure it is positioned to align with the interface on the chassis when the contraption rotates.

#### 4. **Power and Activate the Contraption:**
1. **Power the System:**
   - Ensure the water wheel or windmill is properly powered. For a water wheel, ensure it is placed in a flowing water stream. For a windmill, ensure it has enough sails and is placed in an open area.

2. **Start the Rotation:**
   - Activate the mechanical bearing to start the rotation. This will cause the chassis and saw to move in a circular pattern, chopping any trees in its path.

### Example Layout:

**Chassis and Saw Setup:**
```
[M] - Mechanical Bearing
[C] - Linear Chassis
[S] - Mechanical Saw
```

**Power Source Setup:**
```
[W] - Water Wheel or Windmill Bearing
[S] - Shaft
[C] - Cogwheel

[W] -> [S] -> [C] -> [M]
```

**Storage Setup:**
```
[PSI] - Portable Storage Interface
[C/B] - Chest or Barrel

[PSI] (attached to chassis)
 |
[PSI] (attached to chest/barrel)
[C/B]
```

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Set Up the Mechanical Saw:**
   - Place a mechanical bearing on the ground.
   - Attach a linear chassis block directly on top of the mechanical bearing.
   - Place two more linear chassis blocks extending horizontally from the first chassis block.
   - Attach a mechanical saw to the end of the linear chassis. Use super glue to secure the saw.

2. **Build the Power Source:**
   - Place a water wheel or windmill bearing near the mechanical bearing.
   - Use shafts and cogwheels to connect the water wheel or windmill to the mechanical bearing.

3. **Set Up Storage and Collection:**
   - Attach a portable storage interface to the chassis near the mechanical saw.
   - Place a chest or barrel nearby.
   - Attach a second portable storage interface to the chest or barrel.

4. **Power and Activate the Contraption:**
   - Ensure the water wheel is in flowing water or the windmill has enough sails.
   - Activate the mechanical bearing to start the rotation, causing the saw to chop trees and collect logs.

By following these steps, you'll have a functional, portable tree chopper that uses the Create mod's mechanical components to chop trees and collect logs efficiently.
