## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Yes — and this is a very important legal nuance in Michigan.

Even though Dad doesn’t currently have a stable place or legal custody, if Ayden is **no longer living with the parent who receives child support** (Mom), and **Mom has lost physical custody or is under a PPO**, then Dad can absolutely file to:

### ✅ Suspend, Reduce, or Terminate His Child Support Obligation

---

### 🔑 Key Legal Principle in Michigan:
> ❗ Child support is owed to the parent who has **primary physical custody**. If that parent no longer has custody or the child has been removed from their home — even temporarily — the support order becomes factually inaccurate and must be updated.

---

## 🔁 What Dad Should Do Right Now

### 🧾 1. File a Motion to Modify Support
- File a “Motion Regarding Support” with the family court that issued the original order.
- Attach an affidavit or declaration stating:
  - Ayden no longer lives with Mom or stepdad.
  - The home is unsafe (citing the PPO).
  - Child support is no longer appropriate because she is not the custodial parent.
- He doesn’t need to have custody yet to freeze support — just that she’s not entitled to receive it anymore.

➡️ The Friend of the Court (FOC) will likely schedule a support review.

---

### 🏠 2. Clarify His Living Situation Honestly
Even if he’s staying with a friend:
- Courts understand that many protective or displaced parents are in transition.
- If he’s trying to step up and be a safer parent, they may still favor him over Mom/stepdad.
- If Ayden is staying with him even temporarily, that’s strong evidence of a shift in physical custody.

---

### 🧒 3. If Ayden Is in Protective Custody or With a Relative
If Ayden is living with you (a relative), CPS, or another adult:
- Dad can file a motion to stop support to the mom and have the money redirected or paused.
- The court might set support as $0 until a new custodial arrangement is finalized.

---

### 📞 4. Contact Friend of the Court (FOC) Immediately
- Dad should tell them the situation has changed and ask for a support review.
- He can file the support motion while working on custody or a more permanent home plan.

## 🧠 TL;DR – Yes, He Can Act

| Issue                                        | Answer                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mom no longer has custody                   | ✅ Yes — Support can be frozen or redirected                           |
| Dad doesn’t have a home right now           | 🚧 Not ideal, but not disqualifying                                    |
| Can support be nullified or paused?         | ✅ Yes — via motion and FOC review                                     |
| Does he need custody first?                 | ❌ No — he just needs to show Mom no longer has physical custody       |
