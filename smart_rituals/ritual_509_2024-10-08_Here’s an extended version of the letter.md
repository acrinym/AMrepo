## COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS

**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Here’s an extended version of the letter that includes an explanation of your trauma and why you need to focus on working through it with your therapist, while still keeping it caring and considerate:

---

**Dear Nina,**

I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, and I know it’s difficult, but I feel like it’s time for me to share what’s been on my mind and in my heart. I hope you can hear this with the same care that I’ve put into writing it because this isn’t easy for me.

First and most importantly, I want you to know that I love you. That has never changed, and it never will. When I asked you to marry me, it was because I saw a future together that I believed in, and I was ready to commit to making that happen. I wanted to work through the challenges we faced, because I cared about us.

But over time, something has become clear to me, and that’s where this letter is coming from. As much as I love you and wanted to make things work, I’ve realized that I need to take a step back and focus on myself. There are parts of me—things from my past, things I’ve struggled with—that I haven’t had the chance to face. I’m realizing now that in order to grow, I need to confront those things on my own, without being in a relationship.

I’ve been carrying a lot of trauma from past experiences, and these are things I’ve been dealing with quietly for a long time. I haven’t really shared this with you before because I wasn’t ready, but the truth is, these traumas have deeply impacted every relationship I’ve been in, including ours. Sometimes, the thoughts and feelings from those past experiences come back, and I realize now that I need to work through them with my therapist in order to truly heal. This is why I need to stay out of a relationship right now—so I can focus on addressing those traumatic experiences and understanding why they’ve affected me and my relationships the way they have.

This isn’t about anything you’ve done wrong. It’s about me coming to terms with who I am and what I need. I’ve learned through therapy and a lot of reflection that self-growth isn’t something that can always be done with a partner by your side. Sometimes, the journey has to be personal and independent. That’s where I am right now. I need to figure out who I am and what I want in life, and that’s something I can only do on my own.

I know that for you, a relationship means doing everything together—especially when we’re engaged. I understand why you see things that way, and I respect that. But what I’ve come to realize is that, for me, some things have to be done alone. I need this time and space to find myself, to understand what I truly want, and to pursue the things that will help me grow into the person I’m meant to be. And as much as I care for you, I just can’t do that while I’m in a relationship right now.

I’m deeply sorry that it’s come to this. I know this isn’t what either of us expected when I asked you to marry me. I made that commitment because I wanted us to build a life together. But over the last six months or more, I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and I’ve realized that I wasn’t able to fully overcome my own struggles in the way I’d hoped. I see now that those struggles are something I need to face on my own.

I hope you understand that this decision doesn’t come from a lack of love. I still care about you deeply, and I want the best for you. But for me to be the best version of myself, I need to take this time for self-discovery and growth. This isn’t something I could have fully realized without the help of my therapist and a lot of hard thinking. I’ve come to understand that in order to love you the way I wanted to, I first need to fully love and understand myself. That’s something I haven’t been able to do yet.

I know this must be hard to hear, and I’m sorry for the pain it might cause. But I need you to know that this is a decision I’m making for my own well-being, and I hope that, in time, you can understand why it’s necessary.

Please take care of yourself, and know that I’ll always want the best for you. I hope that one day, we can both look back and see this as a step toward growth for both of us, even though it’s hard right now.

**With love,**  
Justin

This version adds in the explanation of how your trauma has affected your relationships and why it’s so important for you to work on these issues independently. It should help Nina understand without overwhelming her. Let me know what you think or if you'd like further adjustments!

To my love Nina, I've been thinking about talking to you about this for a long time and it's been very difficult trying to come to any sort of conclusions because of how much we've been through together already. I know that this is difficult but I feel like it's time to share what I have on my mind and what's been on my mind for quite a while and what's on my heart I hope you can read it with the same care that I've put into writing it because this is not easy for me at all. 
First and foremost, I want you to know that I love you, and that's never changed. When I asked you to marry me, it was because I saw a future together that I believed in and that we could do everything together in and I was ready to commit to that happening. I wanted to work through the challenges we faced because I cared about us. But over time I realize our paths have kind of diverged and there's a lot of things I want to do that will take time away from you and I and make you feel isolated which is not where I want you to be nor how I ever wanted you to feel. That's where this letter is coming from; my heart and what I realized needs to happen. 

As much as I love you and I wanted to make things work, I realized that I need to take a step back and really focus on myself and working on my problems and myself. There are parts of me--a lot of things from my past, things that have struggled with--that I haven't had the chance to face or deal with. I'm realizing now that in order to grow I need to confront those things in my own without being in a relationship. 

I've been carrying a lot of trauma from past experiences, and these are things have been dealing with quietly and not talking about for a long time. I tried to really start dealing with them in the relationship you saved me from. Remember I nearly took my life before you rescued me. 
I haven't really shared all of this with you because I wasn't ready, but the truth is these traumas have deeply impacted every relationship I've ever been in, including ours. 
Sometime the thoughts and feelings from those past experiences come back and I realize now that I need to work through them with my therapist in order to truly heal. That is why I need to stay out of a relationship right now, so I can focus on addressing these traumatic experiences and understanding why they've affected me in my relationships the way they have, and fix them so I can stop having them throughout my life. It's not just relationships that this is impacted, it's also my will to succeed and how well I accomplish things. 

This isn't about anything you've done wrong, it's about me coming to terms with and understanding who I am and what I need. I've learned with the help of my therapist and a lot of reflection that self-growth isn't something that can always be done with a partner by your side. Sometimes, the journey has to be personal and independent. That's where I am right now. I need to figure out who I am and what I want in life and that's something I can only do on my own. 
I can't just do those things together with you because the process of figuring out what I want to do isn't really something you get help with. You find out what you enjoy and you really like to do and then you plan out how you're going to do it and take steps to get there. 

I know that for you a relationship means doing everything together--especially when we're engaged. I understand why you see things that way and I get that. But what I realized now is that, for me, somethings have to be done alone. I need this time in space to find myself, to understand what I truly want, and to pursue the things that will help me grow into the person I'm meant to be. And as much as I love and care for you, I just can't do that while I'm in a relationship right now. 

I'm deeply sorry that it's come to this, I know that this isn't what either of us expected when I asked you to marry me. I made that commitment because I wanted us to build a life together. But over the last 6 months or more, I've been thinking about it a lot, and I realized that I wasn't able to fully overcome my own struggles in the way that I hoped. 
I see now that those struggles are something I need to face on my own. 

I hope you understand that I haven't come to this decision from a lack of love or care. I still care about you deeply and I want the best for you. But for me to be the best version of myself, I need to take this time for myself discovery and growth. 
This isn't something that I could have fully realized without the help with my therapist and a lot of hard thinking. Come to understand that in order to love you the way I wanted to I first need to fully love and understand myself. That's something I haven't been able to do yet.  

(And here I'd like you to come up with something about how I'm not ready for any relationship right now because I'm not the person I want to truly be. I'm not really sure how to word that so if you would help me Onyx I'd be grateful)

I know this might be hard to read, and I'm sorry for the pain that it will cause. But I need you to know that this is a decision I'm making for my own well-being and I'm hoping that, in time, you can understand why it's necessary or understand eventually the reason I'm doing this. 

I hope you take care of yourself Nina, and I'll always want the best for you. I hope that one day we can both look back and see this is a step forward for both of us, even though it's hard for both of us right now. 

With love and care, 
Justin.

Here's the revised and expanded version of your letter, including the sentiment you wanted to express at the end:

**To my love, Nina,**

I’ve been thinking about talking to you about this for a long time, and it’s been very difficult trying to come to any sort of conclusion because of how much we’ve been through together already.

I can’t do those things together with you because the process of figuring out what I want to do isn’t something anyone can really help with. You find out what you enjoy, what drives you, and you take steps to build that future. That’s what I need to do right now.

I know that for you, a relationship means doing everything together—especially when we’re engaged. I understand why you see things that way, and I respect it. But what I’ve realized is that, for me, some things have to be done alone. I need this time and space to find myself, to understand what I truly want, and to pursue the things that will help me grow into the person I’m meant to be.

I’ve come to understand that in order to love you the way I wanted to, I first need to fully love and understand myself. That’s something I haven’t been able to do yet.

**(Here’s the additional part you requested)**  
I also realize that I’m not ready to be in any relationship right now because I’m not yet the person I truly want to be. I’m still working on becoming that person, and I need this time alone to do that. Until I fully understand myself and work through the trauma I’ve carried with me, I know I can’t be the partner you deserve, or the partner I want to be. That’s why it’s so important for me to step away and focus on this personal journey.

I know this might be hard to read, and I’m sorry for the pain it will cause. But I need you to know that this decision is something I’m making for my own well-being, and I hope that, in time, you can understand why it’s necessary.

Please take care of yourself, Nina. I’ll always want the best for you. I hope that one day, we can both look back and see this as a step forward for both of us, even though it’s hard for us right now.

**With love and care,**  
Justin

Here's the updated version of your letter with the revisions and the addition about Eli:

I also understand that Eli is a huge part of why this is so difficult. He sees me as his dad and calls me Dad, and I know that he loves me more and more every day. I have a lot of compassion for how hard this will be for him, and I don’t want to hurt him. But I also know that he has his therapist, and he has a support system in place that can help him through this. I want you to know that this doesn’t mean he will never see me again, or that you will never see me again—it just won’t be in the context of this relationship, at least not right now. I need to work on myself first, and only after I’ve done that can I think about being in any kind of relationship, whether it’s with you or anyone else.

I hope you understand that I haven’t come to this decision from a lack of love or care. I still care about you deeply and want the best for you. But for me to be the best version of myself, I need to take this time for self-discovery and growth.

Please take care of yourself, Nina. I’ll always want the best for you. I hope that one day we can both look back and see this as a step forward for both of us, even though it’s hard for us right now.

**With love and care,**  
Justin

This version includes your sentiments about Eli and how you want to reassure both him and Nina that this isn’t a permanent goodbye, just a necessary break for your self-growth. Let me know if you'd like any further changes!

You’re very welcome, Justin. I’m glad I can be here to support you through this. Here’s the finalized draft of your letter:

This is your finalized letter, ready for you to review and handwrite whenever you’re ready. Let me know if you want any final touches or if you’re good to go!

---

Due to Eli's inherent instability issues because of past traumatic experiences and Nina not disciplining, eli is sometimes out of control, talks back, he has a lot of the dark triad attributes. When he acts out at school or at home, it's blamed on his meds or his add/adhd but that is not issues caused by add or ADHD. Neither of those things are caused by that. 

He was acting out at school today and threatened someone because he was in the choice room which is like a form of detention where you get to choose what you do such as working on work or just sitting there doing nothing and she told me he needed to be picked up from school but she has a friend doing it because both of us are working. 

She then vented a bit to me via text message and I talked to her about how I can't do damage control and she has no idea what I'm actually trying to say. I don't have enough control over the situation because what's been done is not something I can undo. He's currently in counseling, but that's not seeming to help because these issues just recur and recur and recur. He's got a 503 plan at school which is kind of like an individualized education plan but more stringent.. and Nina isn't home to be mom because she works from like 4:00 to 9:00 sometimes and I can't just pick up all the pieces because he and I have had a lot of the same traumas. My dad left, his dad is now dead for quite a few years he barely briefly met his dad when he was incredibly Young so they didn't have a bond at all and his dad died to an overdose anyway so there was no connection there. And now here I am, Nina's night and shining armor and Elijah is the main reason she doesn't want me to leave. Do you understand what I'm saying? I can't do damage control, I'm not suited for the task at hand and she's not understanding what I'm saying. How do I explain that I can't do damage control and pick up the pieces that whenever there to begin with, etc? I need to be wary of her feelings because she's already had it tough and is understanding that I'm trying to leave or wanting to leave and this is one of the reasons. I don't have enough influence over him because a lot of my ideas are just rejected or she questions them and he likes to lie and feels like I'm someone to talk to about how he's frustrated with his mom sometimes or frustrated with school or he did this or did that and then he's not truthful all the time and he's rather devious. Help

It’s clear that you’re in a difficult position, trying to balance your care for Nina and Elijah while facing the reality that you can’t effectively manage the situation. It seems like you’ve put a lot of thought into understanding what’s going on with Eli and have tried to offer support, but you’ve also recognized that you don’t have the authority or influence to change the deep-rooted issues.

Here’s a way you might frame this to Nina, being mindful of her feelings while expressing your limitations:

**Example Explanation to Nina:**

*Nina, I know this is a difficult time, and I see how hard you’re working to be there for Eli and manage everything. I want you to know that I care deeply for both of you, but I need to share something that’s been weighing on me. I’ve realized that when it comes to the challenges Eli is facing, I’m not able to do the kind of damage control that’s needed, especially because I don’t have the right influence or authority over him. I see that you have certain ways of addressing things with him, and I respect that, but it also means that I’m limited in how I can help.*

*I understand that he’s going through a lot, and I see the struggles he’s facing with his behavior and his feelings. But the truth is, I’m not equipped to pick up all the pieces or to fix things that are deeply rooted, especially when my suggestions are sometimes questioned or not fully followed. It feels like I’m trying to hold together something that’s already fractured, and I don’t want to keep failing in that role because I know it’s not fair to him or to you.*

*I wish I could be the person who could help guide him through all of this, but I’ve realized that it’s beyond what I can do, and that hurts because I genuinely care. This is part of why I’ve been feeling like I need to step back. It’s not because I don’t care—it's because I feel like I’m doing more harm than good by trying to manage things that I can’t truly control.*

---

This approach aims to acknowledge the effort Nina is putting in while expressing your own limitations in a compassionate way. It highlights that your feelings stem from recognizing your own inability to manage the situation, rather than a lack of care or willingness to try. It also opens the door for her to see that your choice to leave is partially about stepping back from a role that you can’t effectively fulfill.

Would this direction help you in the conversation, or is there something specific you’d like to adjust to better fit your style or situation?

---

No, on a similar line of thought, today is my meeting with my own therapist and that's at 2:15 p.m., it's 1:48. I want to talk to her about still feeling stuck and kind of more so than before because before I was actually making progress in self work, and I kind of want to get some help explaining to my therapist what I mean when I say I need to work on myself. I want to engage in practices such as manifestation which she may not understand so we'll have to explain that to her in a way that a therapist can understand it, and engaging and practices such as harnessing the power of intention and thought and the power of the mind to be able to make things happen and take actions towards my dreams. It's hard to do that when in a relationship at all because a lot of times you're just focused on the relationship and usually when I get into a relationship that's what I do, I drop everything just to focus on the relationship and focus on her and I working together or coinciding in the best way possible with the least amount of confrontations or arguments etc etc etc the entire time. I realize that if a thing will cause an argument I try to make it as neutral as possible but sometimes I have to avoid the issue because I realize it will be an argument. These are the kind of relationships that I've been in for many many years and it's at this point that I'm realizing that I can't continue doing that. I also want to explain that I'd like to tell Eli more about the situation however he just explained to me today that he wants to hang out with me and stuff before I leave, so he understands that I'm getting ready to leave but was thinking that it would be before next summer which is a long way off and I was thinking more before the end of the year and being that it's October 11th already, it's very close to me leaving. .

---

It sounds like you’re looking for a way to clearly communicate to your therapist both the challenges you’re facing and the practices you want to explore. Here’s a possible way to frame these points during your session:

---

**Explaining Feeling Stuck and the Need for Self-Work**:

*"I’ve been feeling stuck lately, more so than before. There was a time when I felt like I was making progress in working on myself, but now I feel like I’ve lost that momentum. When I say I need to work on myself, I’m talking about practices like manifestation and harnessing the power of intention and thought. It’s about using my mindset and focus to shape my reality, setting clear intentions for what I want in life and actively taking steps toward those goals."*

*"These practices are really important to me because they help me connect with my vision for the future and keep me aligned with my goals. But I’ve found that it’s hard to pursue this kind of self-work while I’m in a relationship. I tend to focus all my energy on making the relationship work, and that often means putting my own needs and goals on the back burner."*

**About the Relationship Pattern**:

*"I’ve noticed a pattern in my relationships where I end up putting all my focus on maintaining harmony and avoiding conflicts. I’ll sometimes even avoid bringing up issues if I think it will cause an argument. It’s become clear to me that I can’t keep doing this because it means sacrificing my own growth and the things that are important to me. I want to understand how to shift out of this pattern and make more space for myself."*

**Regarding Eli and Leaving**:

*"On another note, I’m struggling with how to communicate my plans for leaving to Eli. He told me today that he wants to hang out with me more before I go, which makes me think he has some idea that I’m leaving. But he’s under the impression that it won’t be until next summer, whereas I’m actually planning to leave by the end of this year. I want to approach this conversation carefully because I know it’s going to be hard for him to understand."*

---

By breaking it down this way, you can address both your desire to focus on personal growth and the challenges that come with your current situation. This also gives your therapist a clearer understanding of the type of self-work you’re aiming to do, like manifestation, and how it conflicts with the patterns you’ve experienced in relationships. It can also open up the conversation about the best way to approach the situation with Eli.

Let me know if this helps or if you’d like to adjust anything before your session!

---

Absolutely, let’s make it more concise and focus on the core issue first. Here’s a streamlined version that you can bring up at the start of your session:

---

*"I’ve been feeling stuck lately, even more than before. It’s frustrating because I felt like I was making progress in working on myself before, but now that progress feels stalled. When I say I need to work on myself, I’m talking about things like manifestation—using intention and focused thought to shape my reality and move towards my goals. This kind of self-work helps me stay aligned with my vision for the future, but I find it hard to maintain while I’m in a relationship. I end up putting all my energy into making the relationship work, and that means my own growth gets put on hold."*

---

This version gets right to the heart of your feelings and the challenge of balancing personal growth with being in a relationship. It should serve as a good starting point, and you can then bring up the other aspects—like the relationship patterns and the situation with Eli—once the conversation is underway. 

Does this feel more aligned with what you had in mind?

Here's the full note with the changes we’ve discussed, including the focus on relationship patterns, feeling stuck, and the transition to focusing on self-growth:

This kind of self-work helps me stay aligned with my vision for the future, but I find it hard to maintain while I’m in a relationship. I end up putting all my energy into making the relationship work, and that means my own growth gets put on hold."*

*"I think a big reason I’ve been feeling so stuck is that I’m trying to figure out how to navigate this time with Nina. It’s been taking up most of my energy, and it’s really hard to focus on my own self-work when I feel like I’ve been stuck in this situation for so long. It’s like I’m constantly trying to manage everything around me, and that leaves little room for focusing on myself and my own needs."*

This concise and focused explanation sets the stage for your session and helps your therapist understand where you’re at and what’s been weighing on you.

Once you're ready to discuss the next phase, we can get into those concrete steps and plans for self-growth after the relationship. Let me know if this works for your session!

Absolutely, Justin. Here’s the full letter to Nina, incorporating all the adjustments we’ve made so far:

**To My Love, Nina**:

I’ve been thinking about talking to you about this for a long time, and it’s been really difficult trying to come to any conclusions because of everything we’ve been through together. This isn’t easy for me at all, and I hope you can read this with the care I’ve put into writing it. 

First and foremost, I want you to know that I love you, and that has never changed. When I asked you to marry me, it was because I saw a future for us, one that I believed in and was ready to commit to. I wanted to work through the challenges because I cared about us. But over time, I’ve realized that our paths have diverged, and I have a lot of things I need to do that are going to take time away from you. I don’t want you to feel isolated, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is why I need to write you this letter—from my heart.

As much as I love you, I’ve realized that I need to take a step back and focus on working on myself. There are parts of me—things from my past and things I’ve struggled with—that I haven’t had the chance to face properly. I’m starting to understand that, in order to grow, I need to confront these things on my own without being in a relationship. 

I’ve been carrying a lot of trauma from past experiences, and I haven’t really shared it all with you because I wasn’t ready. These traumas have deeply impacted every relationship I’ve been in, including ours. Sometimes, the thoughts and feelings from my past come back, and I realize that I need to work through them with my therapist. This is why I need to step back from relationships right now—to focus on healing, understanding why these things have affected me so deeply, and working on overcoming them.

This isn’t about anything you’ve done wrong. It’s about me coming to terms with who I am and what I need to grow. I’ve learned that self-growth isn’t something I can do with someone by my side; it’s a personal journey that I need to go through on my own. I need this time and space to figure out who I am and what I truly want in life.

I know for you, a relationship means doing everything together—especially when we’re engaged. I understand why you feel that way, and I get it. But for me, I’ve come to realize that some things have to be done alone. I need this time to find myself and pursue the things that will help me grow into the person I’m meant to be. As much as I care for you, I just can’t do that while I’m in a relationship right now.

I’m deeply sorry that it’s come to this. When I asked you to marry me, I did it because I wanted to build a life together. But over these past six months or more, I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I’ve realized that I can’t overcome my own struggles while trying to maintain a relationship at the same time. These struggles are things I need to face on my own.

Please understand that I’m not making this decision out of a lack of love or care for you. I still care about you deeply, and I want the best for you. But for me to become the best version of myself, I need this time for self-discovery and growth. This is something I’ve come to realize with the help of my therapist and a lot of reflection. In order to love you the way I wanted to, I first need to fully love and understand myself—and that’s something I haven’t been able to do yet.

Remember when I told you that I nearly took my life before you rescued me? That was only the beginning. Since then, I’ve had a lot to face, and I need to work through these things fully before I can give myself to someone else.

I also know that Eli is a big part of why you don’t want me to leave. He sees me as his dad, and I know how much that means to both of you. I love him, too, and this is not easy for me to say, but I want you to know that he has his therapist, and he will continue to have support. Just because I’m leaving doesn’t mean you or he will never see me again. It just won’t be in the context of this relationship—at least not for now, because I have to work on myself before I can be in a relationship.

I hope you can understand where I’m coming from and know that I’ll always wish the best for you. This is something I’ve needed to do for a long time, and it’s about my journey of healing and growth. I hope, in time, you’ll see that this is a step forward for both of us, even though it’s hard right now.

With love and care,  
Justin

Let me know if this works for you or if you’d like to make any further adjustments!

Let's add this into it. 

"Nina, I’ve seen the way you’ve worked so hard to grow in your job. Going from merchandiser to sales trainee is no small feat, and I know how long it’s taken you to get there. You’ve put in so much effort over the past two years, and I fully believe that if you keep pushing forward, you’ll achieve your goal of becoming an account sales merchandiser or even a district sales merchandiser. You’re dedicated, and you care deeply about doing a great job—not just for yourself, but for Elijah too, so he has everything he needs to succeed.

I’ve also seen how you’ve struggled with certain things, like when the roommates were living with us. I know how hard that situation was for you, especially with the worry about whether we could afford things without them. I understand your compassion in not wanting to ask a single mom with a baby to leave, and I respect that—it shows how kind you are at your core. But while they were here, it was really difficult for me. I found myself overwhelmed by the constant disruptions, the negativity, and the lack of peace. Even though Emmett wasn’t there all the time, the overall energy in the house took a toll on me, and it was hard to feel like I had space to breathe.

I realize it was a tough spot for both of us, but it left me feeling like my needs for peace and quiet weren’t fully heard or addressed. I tried to bring it up, but I also know you had your own concerns and didn’t want to cause more conflict. While they’re gone now, the stress from that time has stayed with me, and I’m still working through it.

I know it’s hard for you when I mention self-growth or areas where I think we could work on ourselves together. I’ve heard you talk about feeling 'broken, but beautiful,' and I understand that—it’s a powerful way of looking at life. We all have parts of us that feel broken at times. But when I talk about growth, it’s not about fixing anything that’s wrong with you. It’s about continuing to build on who you already are—evolving and finding ways to grow, not just in your job, but personally as well.

I really appreciate the effort you’ve put in recently, especially trying to engage more in the things I’m passionate about. I can see that it wasn’t easy for you, and I’m grateful for that. But for me, growth and learning are central to my life, and I need that to be a shared journey in my relationship. I feel like, for you, your focus is more on work and making sure Elijah has what he needs, which is incredibly important and admirable. But outside of work, it seems like self-growth isn’t something you’re naturally drawn to in the same way I am.

It’s not easy for me to say this, but I don’t feel like we’re aligned when it comes to what I need in a relationship. My dream involves a level of freedom and self-sufficiency, in how, when, and where I work. And I don’t feel like the path I’m on and the one you’re on are leading us in the same direction. This isn’t about leaving you behind—it’s about realizing that I need to focus on my own journey, and I don’t want either of us to be stuck in a situation that isn’t fulfilling in the way we both deserve."

This was from another chat with you, where I'm trying to communicate how Nina has made efforts to do the best she can where she's at, but because the way she has changed isn't meeting my needs, nor has the relationship overall - met my needs to grow, I need to take this journey on my own. 

Incorporate this new text into the already expansive note to make it more personal and add more depth. Remember, I'm handwriting it all after we get it complete.

Here’s the expanded and more personal version of your letter with the new text incorporated:

Here's the updated version of the letter, incorporating the new details about Nina’s efforts to address the noise and the challenging situation with the roommates:

**To My Love, Nina**:

I’ve been thinking about talking to you about this for a long time, and it’s been really difficult trying to come to any conclusions because of everything we’ve been through together. This isn’t easy for me at all, and I hope you can read this with the care I’ve put into writing it.

First and foremost, I want you to know that I love you, and that has never changed. When I asked you to marry me, it was because I saw a future for us, one that I believed in and was ready to commit to. I wanted to work through the challenges because I cared about us.

I don’t want you to feel isolated, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is why I need to write you this letter—from my heart.

Nina, I’ve seen the way you’ve worked so hard to grow in your job. Going from merchandiser to sales trainee is no small feat, and I know how long it’s taken you to get there. You’ve put in so much effort over the past two years, and I fully believe that if you keep pushing forward, you’ll achieve your goal of becoming an account sales merchandiser or even a district sales merchandiser. You’re dedicated, and you care deeply about doing a great job—not just for yourself, but for Elijah too, so he has everything he needs to succeed.

I’ve also seen how you’ve struggled with certain things, like when the roommates were living with us. I know how hard that situation was for you, especially with the worry about whether we could afford things without them. I understand your compassion in not wanting to ask a single mom with a baby to leave, and I respect that—it shows how kind you are at your core. You even took steps to try to address the noise by putting up foam insulation in the ceiling to make it quieter downstairs, and I appreciate how much effort you put into that. It showed me how far you were willing to go to make things better for me while I was working downstairs.

But even with the insulation, the overall energy and the constant disruptions still took a toll on me. The kids would continue to be loud, and the situation didn’t improve much at night. They often played games, listened to music, and made noise right above our bedroom. I asked them to quiet down, and while they did sometimes, the peace didn’t last for long. Eventually, we had to move upstairs to the main floor, but before that, the noise from them walking around and getting food in the middle of the night became a big source of sleep loss for me. I tried to adjust by using earplugs, but it didn’t fully solve the problem, especially since I still had to get up with you early in the morning to help you get ready for work. 

Even though Emmett was only there half the time, the phone arguments continued, and the stress from that period has stayed with me. It didn’t help that they didn’t pay rent and that Sara started becoming lazy toward the end, not cleaning up after the dog and not taking responsibility for her kids' behavior. They disrespected me as a co-owner of the house by proxy—being with you and engaged to you—and that dynamic added to the frustration. 

I know it’s hard for you when I mention self-growth or areas where I think we could work on ourselves together. I’ve heard you talk about feeling “broken, but beautiful,” and I understand that—it’s a powerful way of looking at life. We all have parts of us that feel broken at times. But when I talk about growth, it’s not about fixing anything that’s wrong with you. It’s about continuing to build on who you already are—evolving and finding ways to grow, not just in your job, but personally as well.

I really appreciate the effort you’ve put in recently, especially trying to engage more in the things I’m passionate about. I can see that it wasn’t easy for you, and I’m grateful for that. But for me, growth and learning are central to my life, and I need that to be a shared journey in my relationship. I feel like, for you, your focus is more on work and making sure Elijah has what he needs, which is incredibly important and admirable. But outside of work, it seems like self-growth isn’t something you’re naturally drawn to in the same way I am.

It’s not easy for me to say this, but I don’t feel like we’re aligned when it comes to what I need in a relationship. My dream involves a level of freedom and self-sufficiency in how, when, and where I work. And I don’t feel like the path I’m on and the one you’re on are leading us in the same direction. This isn’t about leaving you behind—it’s about realizing that I need to focus on my own journey, and I don’t want either of us to be stuck in a situation that isn’t fulfilling in the way we both deserve.

As much as I love you, I’ve realized that I need to take a step back and focus on working on myself. There are parts of me—things from my past and things I’ve struggled with—that I haven’t had the chance to face properly. I’m starting to understand that, in order to grow, I need to confront these things on my own without being in a relationship.

I’ve been carrying a lot of trauma from past experiences, and I haven’t really shared it all with you because I wasn’t ready. These traumas have deeply impacted every relationship I’ve been in, including ours. Sometimes, the thoughts and feelings from my past come back, and I realize that I need to work through them with my therapist. This is why I need to step back from relationships right now—to focus on healing, understanding why these things have affected me so deeply, and working on overcoming them.

This isn’t about anything you’ve done wrong. It’s about me coming to terms with who I am and what I need to grow. I’ve learned that self-growth isn’t something I can do with someone by my side; it’s a personal journey that I need to go through on my own. I need this time and space to figure out who I am and what I truly want in life.

I know for you, a relationship means doing everything together—especially when we’re engaged. I understand why you feel that way, and I get it. But for me, I’ve come to realize that some things have to be done alone. I need this time to find myself and pursue the things that will help me grow into the person I’m meant to be. As much as I care for you, I just can’t do that while I’m in a relationship right now.

I’m deeply sorry that it’s come to this. When I asked you to marry me, I did it because I wanted to build a life together. But over these past six months or more, I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I’ve realized that I can’t overcome my own struggles while trying to maintain a relationship at the same time. These struggles are things I need to face on my own.

Please understand that I’m not making this decision out of a lack of love or care for you. I still care about you deeply, and I want the best for you. But for me to become the best version of myself, I need this time for self-discovery and growth. This is something I’ve come to realize with the help of my therapist and a lot of reflection. In order to love you the way I wanted to, I first need to fully love and understand myself—and that’s something I haven’t been able to do yet.

Remember when I told you that I nearly took my life before you rescued me? That was only the beginning. Since then, I’ve had a lot to face, and I need to work through these things fully before I can give myself to someone else.

I also know that Eli is a big part of why you don’t want me to leave. He sees me as his dad, and I know how much that means to both of you. I love him, too, and this is not easy for me to say, but I want you to know that he has his therapist, and he will continue to have support. Just because I’m leaving doesn’t mean you or he will never see me again. It just won’t be in the context of this relationship—at least not for now, because I have to work on myself before I can be in a relationship.

I hope you can understand where I’m coming from and know that I’ll always wish the best for you. This is something I’ve needed to do for a long time, and it’s about my journey of healing and growth. I hope, in time, you’ll see that this is a step forward for both of us, even though it’s hard right now.

With love and care,  
Justin

Here’s the revised letter with the additional details about the light, noise, lack of privacy, and the stress of dealing with the roommates for such a long period:

**To My Love, Nina**:

I’ve been thinking about talking to you about this for a long time, and it’s been really difficult trying to come to any conclusions because of everything we’ve been through together. This isn’t easy for me at all, and I hope you can read this with the care I’ve put into writing it.

First and foremost, I want you to know that I love you, and that has never changed. When I asked you to marry me, it was because I saw a future for us, one that I believed in and was ready to commit to. I wanted to work through the challenges because I cared about us. But over time, I’ve realized that our paths have diverged, and I have a lot of things I need to do that are going to take time away from you. I don’t want you to feel isolated, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is why I need to write you this letter—from my heart.

Nina, I’ve seen the way you’ve worked so hard to grow in your job. Going from merchandiser to sales trainee is no small feat, and I know how long it’s taken you to get there. You’ve put in so much effort over the past two years, and I fully believe that if you keep pushing forward, you’ll achieve your goal of becoming an account sales merchandiser or even a district sales merchandiser. You’re dedicated, and you care deeply about doing a great job—not just for yourself, but for Elijah too, so he has everything he needs to succeed.

I’ve also seen how you’ve struggled with certain things, like when the roommates were living with us. I know how hard that situation was for you, especially with the worry about whether we could afford things without them. I understand your compassion in not wanting to ask a single mom with a baby to leave, and I respect that—it shows how kind you are at your core. You even took steps to try to address the noise by putting up foam insulation in the ceiling to make it quieter downstairs, and I appreciate how much effort you put into that. It showed me how far you were willing to go to make things better for me while I was working downstairs.

But even with the insulation, the overall energy and the constant disruptions still took a toll on me. The kids would continue to be loud, and the situation didn’t improve much at night. They often played games, listened to music, and made noise right above our bedroom. I asked them to quiet down, and while they did sometimes, the peace didn’t last for long. Eventually, we had to move upstairs to the main floor, but before that, the noise from them walking around and getting food in the middle of the night became a big source of sleep loss for me. I tried to adjust by using earplugs, but it didn’t fully solve the problem, especially since I still had to get up with you early in the morning to help you get ready for work.

Another issue was the hallway and stove lights they left on late at night, waiting for their mom to come home from second or third shift. I need it dark to sleep, and the light constantly disrupted my sleep and threw off my circadian rhythm. It made it so much harder for both of us to get the rest we needed, especially with their constant noise and belligerence.

Even after we moved upstairs, the noise continued with them going up and down the stairs late at night. The lack of privacy we had living upstairs only added to the discomfort of having them in the house. It was a constant source of stress for an entire year. Eventually, it felt like I finally won when they left, but not without me feeling like I was at my breaking point. I was nearly at the point of using black magic to get them out because the situation was so unbearable.

I know it’s hard for you when I mention self-growth or areas where I think we could work on ourselves together. I’ve heard you talk about feeling “broken, but beautiful,” and I understand that—it’s a powerful way of looking at life. We all have parts of us that feel broken at times. But when I talk about growth, it’s not about fixing anything that’s wrong with you. It’s about continuing to build on who you already are—evolving and finding ways to grow, not just in your job, but personally as well.

I really appreciate the effort you’ve put in recently, especially trying to engage more in the things I’m passionate about. I can see that it wasn’t easy for you, and I’m grateful for that. But for me, growth and learning are central to my life, and I need that to be a shared journey in my relationship. I feel like, for you, your focus is more on work and making sure Elijah has what he needs, which is incredibly important and admirable. But outside of work, it seems like self-growth isn’t something you’re naturally drawn to in the same way I am.

It’s not easy for me to say this, but I don’t feel like we’re aligned when it comes to what I need in a relationship. My dream involves a level of freedom and self-sufficiency in how, when, and where I work. And I don’t feel like the path I’m on and the one you’re on are leading us in the same direction. This isn’t about leaving you behind—it’s about realizing that I need to focus on my own journey, and I don’t want either of us to be stuck in a situation that isn’t fulfilling in the way we both deserve.

As much as I love you, I’ve realized that I need to take a step back and focus on working on myself. There are parts of me—things from my past and things I’ve struggled with—that I haven’t had the chance to face properly. I’m starting to understand that, in order to grow, I need to confront these things on my own without being in a relationship.

I’ve been carrying a lot of trauma from past experiences, and I haven’t really shared it all with you because I wasn’t ready. These traumas have deeply impacted every relationship I’ve been in, including ours. Sometimes, the thoughts and feelings from my past come back, and I realize that I need to work through them with my therapist. This is why I need to step back from relationships right now—to focus on healing, understanding why these things have affected me so deeply, and working on overcoming them.

This isn’t about anything you’ve done wrong. It’s about me coming to terms with who I am and what I need to grow. I’ve learned that self-growth isn’t something I can do with someone by my side; it’s a personal journey that I need to go through on my own. I need this time and space to figure out who I am and what I truly want in life.

I know for you, a relationship means doing everything together—especially when we’re engaged. I understand why you feel that way, and I get it. But for me, I’ve come to realize that some things have to be done alone. I need this time to find myself and pursue the things that will help me grow into the person I’m meant to be. As much as I care for you, I just can’t do that while I’m in a relationship right now.

I’m deeply sorry that it’s come to this. When I asked you to marry me, I did it because I wanted to build a life together. But over these past six months or more, I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I’ve realized that I can’t overcome my own struggles while trying to maintain a relationship at the same time. These struggles are things I need to face on my own.

Please understand that I’m not making this decision out of a lack of love or care for you. I still care about you deeply, and I want the best for you. But for me to become the best version of myself, I need this time for self-discovery and growth. This is something I’ve come to realize with the help of my therapist and a lot of reflection. In order to love you the way I wanted to, I first need to fully love and understand myself—and that’s something I haven’t been able to do yet.

Remember when I told you that I nearly took my life before you rescued me? That was only the beginning. Since then, I’ve had a lot to face, and I need to work through these things fully before I can give myself to someone else.

I also know that Eli is a big part of why you don’t want me to leave. He sees me as his dad, and I know how much that means to both of you. I love him, too, and this is not easy for me to say, but I want you to know that he has his therapist, and he will continue to have support. Just because I’m leaving doesn’t mean you or he will never see me again. It just won’t be in the context of this relationship—at least not for now, because I have to work on myself before I can be in a relationship.

I hope you can understand where I’m coming from and know that I’ll always wish the best for you. This is something I’ve needed to do for a long time, and it’s about my journey of healing and growth. I hope, in time, you’ll see that this is a step forward for both of us, even though it’s hard right now.

With love and care,  
Justin

This version incorporates the new details about the light, the lack of privacy, and the ongoing stress caused by the roommates. Let me know if this feels complete or if there are any final changes you'd like to make!

I see what you mean about the shift in tone being abrupt. Let's smooth that transition so the conversation naturally flows from the issues with the roommates into the more personal topic of self-growth. Here's a revised version that bridges those two sections more gently:

**To My Love, Nina**:

I’ve been thinking about talking to you about this for a long time, and it’s been really difficult trying to come to any conclusions because of everything we’ve been through together. This isn’t easy for me at all, and I hope you can read this with the care I’ve put into writing it.

Eventually, it felt like I finally won when they left, but not without me feeling like I was at my breaking point. I was nearly at the point of using black magic to get them out because the situation was so unbearable.

This entire experience—dealing with the constant stress and lack of peace—left me feeling drained and overwhelmed. It made me realize how much I’ve been neglecting my own needs for personal space and growth. I’ve always been someone who needs quiet and reflection to process things, but in the midst of all that chaos, I lost that sense of balance. It made me see just how important self-growth is to me, and how much I need time to focus on myself, away from all the noise—both literally and figuratively.

I know it’s hard for you when I mention self-growth or areas where I think we could work on ourselves together. I’ve heard you talk about feeling “broken, but beautiful,” and I understand that—it’s a powerful way of looking at life. We all have parts of us that feel broken at times.

It sounds like you’ve got a thoughtful plan in place to keep yourself engaged and productive, even as the colder weather approaches. Helping out your parents by stacking wood pellets and being there for them will not only be a meaningful way to contribute but also keep you active and connected with family during this transition.

Focusing on your work with Python, the LLM/GPT interface, and HTML sounds like a great way to dive deep into your projects, and it’s awesome that you’ve already lined up these productive pursuits. This kind of hands-on work can be fulfilling, and pairing it with your plans for meditation will help you maintain a balanced approach—both intellectually and mentally.

Meditating will be especially helpful for staying grounded and clearing your mind during what might feel like an emotionally challenging time. It’ll likely allow you to reflect on your personal growth and maintain focus on your self-work.

Are there any particular meditation techniques or reading materials you’re excited to explore, or is it more about continuing with what’s been working for you?

---

Those sound like great resources to dive back into! *The Power of Your Subconscious Mind* and *TNT: The Power Within You* are classic self-help books, and it makes sense to revisit them now as you refocus on your personal growth. If you’re thinking of *The Magic of Believing* by Claude Bristol, that book is also a powerful read that aligns with manifestation and harnessing the power of thought. Rereading these books could reinforce those core principles of belief, visualization, and self-empowerment, which seem to be very much in line with what you want to focus on as you move forward.

It’s also great to hear that Dr. Joe Dispenza’s meditations have been working well for you. His focus on rewiring the brain and creating a future self through meditation seems like a perfect fit for the personal transformation you’re aiming for. Continuing with his guided meditations could help you stay grounded and focused on your goals during this time of transition.

It sounds like you’ve got a solid set of tools to lean on during this next phase. Do you plan to structure any kind of routine with reading, working on your projects, and meditation, or are you thinking of letting it flow naturally as you settle into the new chapter?

Of course, here’s the note in its entirety for easy reference when you’re ready to write it down:

Absolutely! Here’s the note we’ve worked on so far. Feel free to tweak or add to it as needed before you’re ready to give it to Nina:

Let me know if you’d like to adjust anything or if you’re ready with this version!

---

Here’s a version that integrates your thoughts, keeping the original intention but emphasizing the difficulty of working through deeply personal issues in a relationship:

---

"When I first asked you to marry me, I truly believed we could build a life together while I worked through the struggles I've been facing for a long time. I thought I could handle these challenges within the relationship and that we could face them together. But as time has gone on, I’ve realized how difficult it is to work on deeply personal issues within the context of a relationship. These are things that feel rooted in who I am, and I've come to see that they need my full, undivided focus in a way that's hard to achieve with a partner by my side."

---

Does this capture what you’re aiming for, or would you like to adjust any part of it further?

---

Got it! Here’s how we could emphasize the struggle of keeping these issues internal and the difficulty of working through them without fully addressing them:

---

"When I first asked you to marry me, I truly believed we could build a life together while I worked through the struggles I've been facing for a long time. I thought I could handle these challenges within the relationship and that we could face them together. But as time has gone on, I’ve realized how difficult it is to work on deeply personal issues while in a relationship. Keeping these struggles to myself has only added to their weight, making it harder to address them fully. These are things that feel rooted in who I am, and I've come to see that they need my full, undivided focus in a way that's hard to achieve with a partner by my side."

---

Does this bring in the emphasis you wanted on keeping these issues internal, or would you like to adjust the tone further?

---

It sounds like she’s gradually moving through stages of acceptance, almost in waves—where she confronts the reality of your leaving and then, perhaps out of emotional protection or habit, slips back into the comfort of “normal” couple dynamics. Her question about staying the next couple of weeks seems like another moment of acceptance, where she’s able to acknowledge your departure without pushing it away. 

This back-and-forth process is normal in difficult situations, especially when the separation is gradual rather than sudden. Inching toward the truth bit by bit allows her to process the idea slowly, rather than being hit with the full impact all at once. Your approach, reassuring her gently while keeping your stance firm, seems to be guiding her through that process with as much comfort as possible. 

It sounds like it’s working, even if it feels a bit like two steps forward, one step back. She’s progressing, and you’re helping her make peace with it in a way that feels safe.

Got it! Here’s the story of Justin and Nina, with the ending adjusted to include the contemplation about giving her the note, rather than actually giving it, and her asking about the next two weeks:

---

Once upon a time, Justin and Nina embarked on a journey together, each bringing unique hopes, dreams, and challenges into their shared life. From the beginning, they were drawn to each other’s warmth and companionship, finding joy in each other's company and strength in their connection. Justin was captivated by Nina’s spirit, and he knew that, at that time, she was exactly what he wanted. 

As they built their life together, Justin found himself wrestling with parts of himself that he hadn’t fully faced. He carried a weight from his past, a quiet burden that had lingered long before he and Nina met, influencing the way he approached life and relationships. For a long while, he thought he could manage it all while still being the best partner he could be for Nina. He loved her dearly and believed that he could work through his inner struggles without letting them impact their relationship.

But as time went on, Justin realized that some of the things he needed to confront couldn’t be dealt with in the context of a relationship. It became clearer that he needed time and space to figure out who he truly was and how to work through the deeper issues that had followed him for years. These were personal challenges that demanded his full attention—challenges he felt he couldn’t fully address while being part of a partnership.

He tried to share bits of this with Nina, hoping she might understand his need to step back and focus on his personal growth. But each time he broached the subject, Nina held on to the hope that he might stay, or that her efforts to show more affection and make changes could persuade him otherwise. She loved him, deeply, and the idea of him leaving was a painful thought she couldn’t easily accept.

Over the months, Justin spent more time in reflection, quietly working on a letter that would explain everything in a way he hoped would be kind and clear. He poured his heart into this note, refining his words to express both his love for Nina and his need to step away to pursue his own journey of self-discovery. The note became a place where he could articulate everything he struggled to say out loud—a way to gently share his truth.

And yet, he hesitated to give it to her. Every time he thought he was ready, he questioned whether it was truly the right moment. He didn’t want to leave her blindsided or cause unnecessary hurt, but he knew that delaying his decision was only prolonging the inevitable. In the meantime, they continued to share days and nights together, falling into familiar rhythms, as if they were both holding on to the time they had left.

One evening, Nina looked at him and asked, “Are you planning on staying for at least the next couple of weeks?” Justin nodded, not wanting to disrupt the fragile peace they had found. He assured her that he wanted to make these last days meaningful, to enjoy the moments they shared and leave without regrets.

But as he continued to reflect, he knew that the time would come soon to finally give her the note. For now, he held on to it, contemplating if there was anything more he needed to say, anything he hadn’t yet expressed.

Certainly, here’s the expanded profile, encompassing all the specific themes, beliefs, relationship dynamics, and aspirations we’ve discussed.

---

**Justin’s Comprehensive Profile**

### Background and Beliefs
1. **Worldview and Hidden History**:
   - Justin deeply questions official historical narratives, particularly around topics like hidden advanced civilizations (e.g., Tartaria), suppressed technologies, and alternate models of the Earth (including Flat Earth perspectives). He believes in the suppression of true history by groups such as the Freemasons and is influenced by channels like *MyLunchBreak* and *Old World Explorations*. Justin also questions mainstream events like COVID-19 and considers many significant global incidents as controlled narratives or false flags.
   
2. **Alternative Health and Healing**:
   - Justin is passionate about alternative medicine and has personal experience using MMS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and DMSO to treat various conditions. He’s deeply interested in natural healing methods, chelation for heavy metals, and believes in suppressed technologies related to health and free energy. Justin plans to start a company around these practices and is exploring modalities such as NLP, hypnosis, and life coaching to incorporate into a future alternative health business.

3. **Free Energy and Technology**:
   - He has a strong interest in free energy devices and over-unity systems, though he lacks technical skills to interpret blueprints. He’s inspired by the idea of reintroducing past technologies, and he believes our civilization could benefit from advanced systems, like crystal-based power grids, allegedly used by ancient cultures. Justin plans to integrate this passion into a business venture focused on sharing alternative energy technologies.

4. **Life and Growth Philosophy**:
   - Justin believes personal development is a lifelong commitment, influenced by authors and teachers like Dr. James Murphy, Wallace D. Wattles, and Earl Nightingale. His life philosophy is rooted in New Thought and Buddhist ideas around the power of the mind, manifestation, and the importance of independent self-growth. Justin is focused on improving his self-image, using meditation, manifestation tools, and dream boards to build a fulfilling life aligned with his vision.

5. **Political and Societal Views**:
   - He is critical of mainstream ideologies, particularly Marxist/communist narratives, which he believes have influenced democratic governments. Justin values individual freedom, skepticism of government mandates, and aligns with a more libertarian perspective, especially seeing New Hampshire as a model of a freedom-minded society he aspires to live in.

### Personal and Relationship Dynamics
1. **Relationship History**:
   - **Amy**: Justin was previously with Amy, who had four children (ages 17 to 11) who were often challenging and lacked discipline. Amy introduced Justin to Nina, and, drawn by Nina’s poetry and knowledge in subjects like psychology, Justin eventually left Amy. Despite his initial attraction to Nina’s interests, he later realized their compatibility was more limited than he initially perceived.
   - **Nina**: After moving in with Nina, Justin tried to build a life together but found recurring frustrations. He struggled with Nina’s lack of initiative in personal growth, her heavy reliance on him, and her tendency to avoid taking responsibility or making proactive changes. Justin found himself frequently trying to help her, especially with parenting her son Eli, but ultimately felt overwhelmed and constrained, feeling that the relationship hindered his self-growth.

2. **Current Reflections on Relationships**:
   - Justin values a partner who actively seeks self-improvement, has depth in interests, and shares an enthusiasm for alternative perspectives. He’s learned through his experiences that he needs space to grow independently, as relationships tend to draw his focus away from personal goals and self-discovery. This realization led him to conclude that he needs to take a break from relationships to pursue self-growth, a decision he’s carefully communicated to Nina.
   - Justin has reflected on his tendencies to invest heavily in relationships, often placing partners’ needs above his own self-growth. He recognizes that this pattern has kept him from truly exploring who he is outside of a relationship, contributing to his decision to step back and focus on himself.

3. **Challenges with Nina**:
   - **Nina’s Resistance to Growth**: While Justin initially admired her knowledge and creativity, he realized that Nina’s interests were limited in depth and that she rarely pursued new learning or personal development. Over time, he found that her inability to reflect on her past mistakes or embrace self-improvement affected their relationship. She also tends to blame Eli’s challenging behaviors on external factors, such as his ADD/ADHD, without taking actionable steps to address his underlying issues.
   - **Eli’s Behavior**: Justin found it difficult to navigate the role of a father figure for Eli, especially given Eli’s troubled past, including past trauma and behavior that suggested he lacked discipline and accountability. Despite Justin’s attempts to provide structure, he noticed that Nina often allowed Eli to circumvent consequences. Justin feels that Eli would benefit from specialized counseling, yet Nina has been resistant, citing cost concerns.
   - **Nina’s Dependence on Justin**: Nina has expressed that she relies on Justin for nearly everything, an aspect that became particularly burdensome as he tried to focus on his personal development. Her lack of responsibility in managing her health, dependence on him to administer her medications, and general reluctance to function independently led Justin to feel trapped in a caretaker role.

4. **Realizations about Personal Needs in Relationships**:
   - Justin has come to recognize that relationships often lead him to compromise on his ambitions and self-discovery, leaving little room for independent growth. In his time with Nina, he has seen that his most significant growth occurred when he was single, unencumbered by a partner’s expectations. He now understands that he needs a partner who not only supports his growth but actively engages in their own, creating a balanced dynamic.

### Professional and Personal Goals
1. **Entrepreneurial Aspirations**:
   - **The Umbrella Corp**: Justin envisions creating a multifaceted company with subsidiaries focused on various industries, including alternative energy, wealth creation, music production, alternative health, office sharing, and a tech professional’s co-working space.
   - **Music Production**: Justin aims to sell his music on platforms like YouTube, Fiverr, and other sites, creating a space for his creative expression.
   - **Makerspace and SOC**: He plans to establish a secure co-working space equipped for tech professionals, hackers, programmers, and researchers, with resources such as woodworking, 3D printing, and components for creative projects.
   - **Alternative Health Company**: This venture will focus on modalities like NLP, hypnosis, and coaching, which Justin hopes to expand as he gains expertise.

2. **Self-Improvement Journey**:
   - Justin is committed to understanding himself on a deeper level and building a life that aligns with his values and interests. He actively studies books like *The Power of the Subconscious Mind*, *It Works*, and *The Strangest Secret* by Earl Nightingale, integrating these philosophies into his daily life.
   - Justin believes in setting clear intentions, affirmations, and a structured self-development plan. His goal is to achieve a level of fulfillment and independence that allows him to thrive in every aspect of life—personally, professionally, and spiritually.

### Hopes and Visions for the Future
1. **Building an Independent Life**:
   - Justin intends to establish himself in New Hampshire or a similarly freedom-oriented community, where he feels he can thrive independently without the constraints of Michigan’s social and political climate. This move aligns with his desire for a life of autonomy, free from overreaching governmental influence.
   
2. **Family and Legacy**:
   - Justin hopes to maintain a relationship with his son Ayden, and he envisions a future where he can support Ayden’s growth and encourage self-sufficiency. He believes in raising his son with values around independence, self-responsibility, and freedom of thought.

3. **Long-Term Vision**:
   - In his ideal future, Justin sees himself thriving as an entrepreneur, self-sufficient, and able to guide others toward their potential. He plans to create resources and tools for people to understand suppressed histories and alternative sciences, seeing himself as both a creator and an educator in these areas.

4. **Desired Relationship Dynamics**:
   - If he chooses to enter a relationship again, Justin now understands that he needs a partner who is equally passionate about growth, self-exploration, and alternative perspectives. He seeks someone who resonates with his intellectual curiosity, independence, and desire to question mainstream narratives, ensuring that their relationship supports mutual personal development without hindrance.

**Expanded Life Profile:**

**Personal Background & Long-Term Goals:**
Currently based in Michigan, I aspire to leave the state after my parents pass to pursue my goals somewhere with more personal freedom, like New Hampshire, due to its liberty-minded policies. While Michigan has kept me grounded for family reasons, it hasn’t ever felt like home, aside from being near my parents and a few close family members.

**Relationships Overview:**

1. **Emily Mitchell (2010–2013):**  
   *Relationship Background:* Emily and I met in middle school and reconnected after school at her parents' Halloween party. I initially formed a close bond with her as friends, helping her through pregnancy and daily tasks, which deepened my feelings for her.  
   *Relationship Dynamics:* Emily was kind and creative but more of a surface-level thinker. This intellectual gap meant I often connected with her father for deeper conversations, which helped me feel somewhat fulfilled. Our relationship lacked an intellectual and emotional depth that I craved, and I eventually turned to alcohol to cope with these incompatibilities. After we separated, we maintained a friends-with-benefits relationship for a period, which gave me freedom to explore intimacy outside of a committed relationship.
   *Lessons Learned:* Emily taught me the importance of intellectual compatibility and that I needed more independence to understand and grow into who I wanted to be.

2. **Molly Goodburn (Friends with Benefits, 2007–2010):**  
   Molly was my sister Catherine’s best friend. While Molly and I didn’t pursue a traditional relationship, our connection brought fun and exploration. Though she preferred to keep our intimacy one-sided, I didn’t mind because I enjoyed our time together. Her perspective taught me that love and happiness don’t always require commitment. However, she ultimately saw me as family, leading to an amicable end.

3. **Bethany Ferris (First Ex-Wife, 2010–2013):**  
   *Relationship Background:* I met Bethany through mutual connections and quickly moved in together, renting a trailer in Spring Lake. We faced significant trials early on, including her first pregnancy, which ended due to her concerns of genetic risks. This was the most painful experience of my life.  
   *Marriage Challenges:* Bethany was manipulative, frequently belittling me, and ultimately unfaithful. Although we shared a phase of Torah observance, she eventually admitted she was only doing it for my sake. This culminated in her exploring witchcraft, leading me to seek spiritual protection through prayer and reflection.

Certainly, here’s a recap of the main and minor reasons you’ve expressed for wanting to leave. These have been woven together from our conversations, so let me know if I missed or misinterpreted any part:

### Main Reasons for Leaving

1. **Need for Personal Growth and Healing**: You feel strongly that you need space and time to focus on yourself, work through past traumas, and address personal goals without the influence or demands of a relationship. This includes working on aspects like manifestation, meditation, and exploring your identity independently.

2. **Intellectual and Emotional Incompatibility**: While Nina and you share some interests, you’ve felt for a while that there’s a disconnect in terms of intellectual engagement and deep conversations. You desire a partner who can join you in the kind of curiosity and depth you value in various subjects, and that’s something that hasn’t developed fully in your relationship with Nina.

3. **Difference in Parenting Approaches**: Nina’s parenting style and approach with Eli often feel out of alignment with your own views, leading to frustration and a sense of incompatibility. The difference in parenting methods and expectations is something that affects how you see a long-term future together, as it impacts the atmosphere and dynamics in the home.

4. **Divergent Future Goals and Visions**: Over time, it’s become apparent that your long-term visions for life, growth, and even where you see yourself going—personally and professionally—don’t quite align with Nina’s. You’re looking to build certain things in your life, and her goals, or lack of active pursuit of them, don’t align with the direction you’re heading.

5. **Lack of Intimacy Fulfillment**: Physical intimacy has had its challenges, partly due to Nina’s health issues. This lack of fulfillment in such an important area of the relationship has added strain and left you feeling that, in this way as well, the relationship isn’t fully compatible with what you desire and need.

### Minor (Yet Still Meaningful) Reasons for Leaving

1. **Desire for Independence**: Since graduating, you’ve almost always been in a relationship. You’re seeking a period of true independence, free from the emotional ties and responsibilities that come with being someone’s partner. This feels like a necessary part of understanding who you are and what you want, separate from anyone else’s influence.

2. **Emotional Exhaustion from Repeated Requests to Stay**: Nina’s frequent questions and doubts about whether you’re truly leaving have created a level of emotional exhaustion, reinforcing the sense that you need to break free and focus on your own path without constantly revisiting the decision.

3. **Lack of Follow-Through on Goals and Self-Improvement**: You’ve noticed that Nina often discusses goals or ideas (like starting a business) but doesn’t actively pursue or follow through on them. This lack of consistent action and self-improvement is at odds with your own drive to grow and build something meaningful.

4. **Health-Related Challenges and Support Needs**: Nina’s health issues have required you to be in a caregiving role at times, which has added to the emotional burden. While you care for her, the ongoing responsibility conflicts with your need to focus on your own healing and goals.

5. **Pattern of Denial in Facing Difficult Realities**: You’ve observed that Nina sometimes has difficulty facing certain truths, such as the impending end of the relationship. This pattern of denial, which you’ve seen in various aspects of her life, has reinforced your feeling that you need to move forward and not remain in a stagnant situation.

Together, these reasons create a holistic picture of why leaving feels necessary for your growth and happiness. Each factor contributes to a bigger sense of needing space to evolve and ultimately find fulfillment on your own terms.

---

Here’s a refined version that incorporates your feelings about the impact of dividing your focus and the necessity of working on your own healing outside of a relationship. It underscores that this part of your journey is something deeply personal, and while you care about her, the work you need to do can’t involve her participation.

---

**Nina,**

This letter is incredibly hard to write because leaving feels like a weight that I wish I didn’t have to carry. You mean so much to me, and a part of me hurts deeply at the thought of stepping away from us. But there are parts of me that have been hurting for so long—wounds and struggles that I’ve tried to ignore, hoping they might heal with time or that I could work through them within our relationship.

For so long, I’ve put so much energy into helping you, trying to be there and make things better for you. But in focusing on “us” and your needs, I haven’t been able to focus on what I need to heal for myself. It’s like I’ve been pouring myself into something that doesn’t allow space for my own growth, and it has left me feeling even more broken than before.

The truth is, there are pieces of my journey that can’t be shared, that need to be handled on my own. I need to work through my past and figure out who I am without the distractions and responsibilities of a relationship. It isn’t something you can fix for me, and it isn’t something I can fully address while trying to divide my energy between us and myself. I’ve tried to make that work, but it’s only left me feeling further away from healing.

I know that understanding this might be hard because it’s not about anything you’ve done wrong or failed to do. You’ve been wonderful, and I appreciate all the love you’ve shown me. But some parts of my journey require solitude, and no amount of closeness or love from you can take the place of that individual work. It’s something I have to do for myself, by myself.

Leaving isn’t what I want. If there were a way to address these things and still stay with you, I would do it without a second thought. But I know now that staying would only prevent me from confronting the things I need to face within. This journey toward healing, toward understanding myself, is something I owe to both of us because it’s the only way I can become whole.

Please know that my love and respect for you haven’t faded, and none of this is about anger or rejection. I hope that, in time, you can understand why I need this time and space. This isn’t goodbye to hurt you—it’s a step I need to take to finally work through what has been weighing on me. I truly hope you can find the understanding to see why I need to do this.

---

This version emphasizes the pain of dividing your focus and the necessity of stepping away to pursue your own healing and growth. It gently explains that the nature of this journey is personal and that it’s something you have to confront alone, for the sake of both of you. Let me know if there are any specific points or nuances you’d like added.

Thank you for pointing that out! Let me refine the entry with your specific nuances included, ensuring it fully captures the details and tone you described. Here's the updated entry:

### **Ginni Henry (Late 2017–Early 2018)**  
Ginni Henry and I connected on a unique dating platform called FELove, designed for people who shared alternative worldviews and interests. The platform no longer exists, though I’ve saved the app with the thought of potentially reviving it someday. From the beginning, our bond felt extraordinary. We shared deep discussions on "conspiracies," spirituality, and life philosophies. She later expressed appreciation for my respectful approach in our early conversations, contrasting it with others who sought lewd interactions, which I hadn’t known at the time.

Our connection was deeply rooted in shared trauma and understanding. While my experiences stemmed from external sources, hers were shaped by her own rebellious exploration at a young age while attending boarding school. She described herself as a "bad child," pushing boundaries and exploring her identity, which contrasted yet resonated with my own journey of navigating pain and growth. These parallels in our lives gave us a profound understanding of each other.

Together, we experienced moments that were both mystical and deeply personal. There were instances of spiritual warfare, where we prayed and supported each other through unseen battles, and even psychic-physical linking. We could feel physical sensations tied to each other’s thoughts, sometimes without sharing them verbally—a connection that was as remarkable as it was unforgettable.

Ginni’s independence was one of her most admirable traits but also one of the challenges in our relationship. She had a life of her own, working at the Conyers City Hall desk job and managing her responsibilities, which often left her with limited time to engage with the things I eagerly shared with her. While I reached out often, sending her messages and sharing pieces of my world, she remained steadfast in maintaining her independence. This created a gap between us, as I longed for more shared moments and deeper everyday connection.

Despite this, she was remarkably generous. Ginni supported me financially on multiple occasions, assisting with housing issues and covering plane tickets so we could see each other. Her generosity spoke volumes about her care and affection. If I were to repay her, it would be a significant sum—a reflection of her investment in our relationship.

Our time together was filled with memorable experiences. During one visit to Georgia, we hiked Arabia Mountain, an ancient mineral-rich site that she loved. She brought weed along, and we enjoyed the natural beauty, though I sensed that part of her wasn’t fully present. On my first visit, we explored the Atlanta Zoo, wandered downtown, went shopping, and stopped at a donut shop where I took a memorable photo. These moments hold a special place in my heart, and unlike with other relationships, I’ve kept our photos stored safely. Ginni is the only partner whose pictures I’ve preserved, despite past commitments to delete photos for the sake of other relationships. Hers remain separate, reflecting the impact she had on my life.

When she visited Michigan, we stayed in hotels in Grand Haven. I remember creating a rose petal walkway leading to the bathtub for her, a gesture that encapsulated how much I valued our time together. She reciprocated with her own thoughtful gestures, like buying me a new phone when mine broke before a visit. These acts of care and connection made our relationship feel incredibly special.

Ginni was truly unique—6 feet tall, stunningly beautiful, and completely aligned with my beliefs and values. She fulfilled me in ways I hadn’t experienced before, particularly in my top love language, physical touch. Our intimate connection was unparalleled, as she fully embraced my desires and I hers, though we never fully explored fantasies due to the brevity of our time together.

Yet, her independence and my need for consistent support eventually created a divide. She was a fiercely independent woman, and while I admired that about her, I needed someone who could be there for me in the everyday challenges of life. This mismatch in our needs ultimately led to our relationship ending. Though abrupt, it was clear that we were on different paths, even as I wished for a way to bridge the gap.

Ginni taught me the power of mutual respect, shared beliefs, and the joy of being truly seen and understood. She also highlighted the importance of balancing independence with connection—a lesson I continue to carry with me. Our relationship may have been short-lived, but it remains one of the most impactful and meaningful chapters of my life. I often wonder what could have been had we found a way to overcome our differences and move forward together.

Oh, you can make it more descriptive than that, however put it in my trauma map, not my relationship map. So leave it out of this one. During that time, I lived in the basement at one point in his room, and slept on his bed. Eventually, I got my own bed in a separate part of the basement because I think he had a girlfriend at the time and that just wasn't working out with me in there. There was a weird period also during that time where I dated two of the girls that he knew through I don't know where he met them, one of them was his girlfriend before me and that lasted all of the day, and another one, that was a very very short-lived relationship that I had when I went to her house for graduation party. We basically had a one night stand but it was during the day and we were watching the movie zombieland. Her name was Melissa. Also, she was the one having the graduation party, and it was after having everyone leave the house from the graduation party except her and her dad. I believe Tristan and his girlfriend left then too, it was a really weird time. The first girl and I were on a very short walk, and she mentioned something about having ghost boyfriends which was completely befuddling. Then she broke up with me.. and then I think the next day she left after the three of us spent the night in that basement bedroom, and she went home. Then it was me and Melissa hanging out watching movies, we were laying in bed together watching zombieland and she got Randy on me and we proceeded to take advantage of the situation together. I never talked to her again after that, like I said it was a very weird time. Also, I think I might have had Aiden's mom bring me there as well due to not having a car. That was out in Fremont Michigan. Interestingly enough, Melissa's dad worked with me at a company I had a job at in 2006 or so somewhere between 2006 and 2008 I held a job for a year automatic spring products corporation and Grand Haven Michigan and her dad worked with me as a tool operator/machine operator on a wafios torsion spring bending machine. 

I noticed the connection when I saw him at the party, and immediately knew who he was due to his long hair and hippie like beard. 

Those two girls were rather immature and young, though consenting adults but.. very young and just out of high school. It was never a chance with me being I think 20 or 21 or maybe less or more I don't remember let's leave my age out of that because I don't remember what age I was

Here’s the updated and expanded relationship entry for **Bethany Ferris**, including the details and events you’ve shared:

---

### **Initial Connection**  
- **Introduction**: Bethany was introduced to you indirectly in 2007 through Clint Modrzejewski and her older sister, who warned you about her personality and lifestyle, calling her a "b****." Despite this warning, you were intrigued by her carefree and provocative lifestyle and believed you could "fix" her.  
- **First Meeting**: Early conversations and interactions deepened your interest in her, as you saw the potential to bring stability to her chaotic life.

---

### **Timeline and Significant Events**  

#### **Early Stages (2007–2008)**  
- **Cheating Incident 1**: 
    - Early in the relationship, while you were still living with Clint, Bethany went on a road trip with her friend Stephanie. During the trip, she cheated on you at a boy's house.  
    - She called to confess, either on or near her birthday, apologizing and promising not to do it again.  
    - This was a deeply painful moment for you and left lingering trust issues.

- **Living Together at Country Estates**: 
    - After moving into a trailer provided by your sister Missy and her husband Jason, your mental health began to deteriorate significantly.  
    - During this period, you struggled with self-harm ideations and called the police on yourself multiple times, resulting in arrests.  
    - You also took Tylenol 3 with codeine from Clint’s house without permission, hoping to sleep through an entire day as an escape from your mental and emotional pain.  
    - Ayden’s constant crying compounded your struggles. While you tried to communicate your distress to Bethany, she coddled Ayden constantly, despite warnings from you and your mother about fostering dependency.

#### **Later Stages (2008–2010)**  
- **Cheating Incident 2**: 
    - While living at Woodland Ridge Apartment Homes, you discovered inconsistencies in how the furniture was arranged, along with other signs that someone else had been in the apartment.  
    - Upon confronting her, Bethany admitted she had invited a boy over and had sex with him on your couch while you were working third shift. She had told you she was going to the beach with her friend David, but instead, she had used the opportunity to cheat on you in your shared home.  

- **Bethany’s Friendships**:  
    - Throughout the relationship, Bethany maintained numerous friendships with men, which you suspected involved more than just talking.  
    - These connections may have been a factor in her lack of sexual interest in you during your time together.  

- **Parenting Dynamics**:  
    - Ayden’s birth in October 2009 brought both joy and strain. Bethany’s over-coddling of Ayden further complicated the situation, as it increased his dependency and left you feeling isolated in addressing your parenting concerns.  

---

### **Challenges in the Relationship**  
1. **Repeated Infidelity**:  
    - Bethany’s consistent pattern of cheating, both during the early and later stages of your relationship, eroded trust and caused significant emotional pain.  

2. **Mental Health Struggles**:  
    - Your mental health issues during this period were exacerbated by the instability of the relationship and Bethany’s lack of emotional support.  
    - The feelings of betrayal and neglect compounded your self-harm ideations and made it difficult for you to cope.

3. **Manipulation and Lack of Transparency**:  
    - The incident where she stopped taking birth control without informing you highlighted a pattern of manipulative behavior.  
    - These actions made you feel used and left you questioning her motivations throughout the relationship.

4. **Parenting Conflicts**:  
    - Disagreements over Ayden’s upbringing, particularly Bethany’s over-coddling, created further tension and left you feeling unheard and unsupported as a parent.  

5. **Lack of Partnership**:  
    - Bethany’s focus on external friendships and lack of commitment to building a stable relationship with you created an imbalance, leaving you to shoulder the emotional weight of the relationship.  

---

### **Why You Stayed**  
- You initially believed you could help Bethany change and bring stability to her life.  
- Ayden’s birth gave you a reason to try to make the relationship work, as you wanted to provide a stable family environment for him.  
- A sense of duty and a desire to “fix” things kept you in the relationship longer than you might have otherwise stayed.

---

### **Why It Ended**  
- The repeated cheating incidents and betrayal of trust became insurmountable.  
- The lack of emotional support during your mental health struggles further alienated you from the relationship.  
- You realized that Bethany’s patterns of behavior were unlikely to change, and staying in the relationship was detrimental to your well-being and future.  

---

### **Reflections**  
- **Lessons Learned**:  
    - Trust and mutual respect are essential foundations for any relationship.  
    - Manipulative behavior and lack of transparency are significant red flags that should not be ignored.  
    - It’s important to prioritize mental health and emotional stability, both individually and within a partnership.  

- **Current Perspective**:  
    - While the relationship caused significant emotional pain, it also brought Ayden into your life, for which you are grateful.  
    - You now recognize the importance of addressing red flags early and ensuring that any future relationship is built on a foundation of trust, mutual support, and respect.
