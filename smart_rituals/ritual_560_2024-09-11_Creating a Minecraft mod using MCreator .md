**NO SUMMARIZATION - ALL PARTS COMBINED BELOW**

Creating a Minecraft mod using MCreator is a great way to bring in custom content such as free energy devices, Tesla generators, and conspiracy-related items or structures. Here's how you can approach this:

### Steps to Get Started with MCreator:
1. **Download MCreator**:
   - First, if you haven't already, download and install MCreator from the official website. MCreator is an easy-to-use mod creation tool for Minecraft that doesn’t require deep programming knowledge.

2. **Create a New Workspace**:
   - Open MCreator and create a new workspace for your mod. This workspace will house all the custom items, blocks, and mechanics you plan to implement.

3. **Designing Free Energy Devices**:
   - **Create a Block for the Device**:
     - Go to the "Add New Element" button and choose to create a block.
     - Name it something like "Tesla Generator" or "Free Energy Device."
     - Configure the block’s properties, such as hardness, resistance, and light emission if you want it to glow like a generator.
   
   - **Energy Mechanics**:
     - Use MCreator's energy system to create custom energy outputs. You can base the Tesla generator on RF (Redstone Flux) or another in-game energy mechanic.
     - Configure the device to produce energy passively, using MCreator's built-in logic.

4. **Adding Conspiracy-Themed Structures**:
   - **Flat Earth Themed Structures**:
     - You could create blocks like a “Flat Earth Monument” or structures that resemble conspiracy-related theories. This could be pyramids, large domes representing artificial sky concepts, or even secret bunkers.
     - Add these as custom structures that can generate randomly in the world or be crafted with specific in-game materials.
   
   - **Secret Tech Installations**:
     - Implement underground bunkers or secret installations where Tesla generators and free energy devices are located. You could also create NPCs that serve as conspiracy theorists, giving out tasks or hidden lore.

5. **Creating Custom Items**:
   - You can add custom items like “Infinite Energy Batteries” or “Tesla Coils” that can power other devices. These items can have a visual effect or even interact with vanilla Minecraft mechanics.

6. **Custom Textures and Models**:
   - Use a tool like **Blockbench** or any other 3D modeling software to create models and textures for your custom blocks and items.
   - For flat images like textures, you can use **GIMP** or **Photoshop** to design the textures for the items, blocks, and devices. Think about conspiracy-related imagery like symbols, pyramids, or glowing runes that might indicate "hidden technology."
   
   - **Textures for Flat Earth Theme**:
     - You could create textures like a ‘Flat Earth Disc’ with a reflective surface, stars, or even borders that resemble walls surrounding the Earth.
   
7. **Scripting Custom Behaviors**:
   - If you want to go deeper into custom behavior, MCreator allows you to script advanced mechanics like energy generation rates, or custom power storage capacities using procedures.

### Example Mods to Add:
- **Tesla Generator Block**:
  - Emits energy in a certain radius that powers nearby redstone devices.
  - Maybe causes lightning strikes during storms, adding a cool effect.

- **Free Energy Device**:
  - Similar to a solar panel, but works anywhere, at any time, and generates more power.

- **Conspiracy Structures**:
  - Create large domes, underground bunkers, or obelisks that randomly generate across the world and contain hidden secrets or special items like “Infinite Energy Crystals.”

### Inspiration for Imagery:
- **Flat Earth Disc**:
  - A block representing a "flat Earth" model could be used as a decorative or functional item, like a map that shows an alternative perspective of the Minecraft world.

- **Tesla Coil Tower**:
  - A tall tower structure with energy beams shooting out at regular intervals, inspired by real-life Tesla towers.

- **Obelisks or Pyramids**:
  - Structures with symbolic meaning, which could even contain hidden technology or lore in the game.

### Next Steps:
- **Test and Debug**:
   - Once your mod is created, test it in Minecraft to ensure the items and blocks behave as intended.
   - Refine energy outputs and adjust the structure generation to your preference.

Let me know if you need help with designing the textures, ideas for specific devices, or working out any tricky mechanics in MCreator!

It sounds like you're looking for something engaging and rewarding to keep your interest while playing solo in your modded Minecraft world. Here are a few project ideas that could provide direction, challenge, and fun while you work in your underground mineshaft environment:

### 1. **Automated Mining Operation Using Create and Mekanism**
   - **Create Mod**: You can build a fully automated mining operation in your mineshaft using the mechanics from the **Create** mod. Set up mechanical drills, conveyor belts, and crushers to automate ore extraction and transport it to your base.
   - **Mekanism Integration**: Use **Mekanism** to process the ores you’re gathering automatically. You can set up machines like the **Enrichment Chamber** and **Purification Chamber** to increase ore yield, giving you more bang for your buck from the resources you mine.
   - **Challenge**: The design and implementation of a fully automated system that drills through the mineshaft and transports items without you needing to lift a pickaxe is both complex and highly satisfying.

### 2. **Build a Hidden Underground City or Bunker**
   - Use the vast space and natural tunnels in the modded mineshaft to build an underground city or a secret bunker. You can go for a dystopian or futuristic look.
   - **Create Automations**: With the **Create** mod, you could have dynamic moving parts—like **elevators** and **conveyor belt systems**—to simulate a working city. Add things like automatic doors, hidden rooms, or even train stations.
   - **Mekanism Tech**: Power the city with **Mekanism** tech, using generators or wind turbines placed on the surface but routed underground for hidden power.

### 3. **Survival Challenge: Self-Sustaining Underground Base**
   - Challenge yourself to make the **underground mineshaft completely self-sustaining**. Focus on automating food production, energy generation, and resource management:
     - **Automated Farming**: Use **Create’s** farming capabilities to grow crops underground.
     - **Mekanism Power**: Generate power using **biofuel** or **solar** routed from the surface to keep your systems running.
     - **Storage Management**: Set up **Create** or **Mekanism** item pipes for storage automation, so all your farming, mining, and crafting materials are managed smoothly.

### 4. **Treasure Hunt with Lore**
   - Write your own **lore and backstory** for the mineshaft, turning it into an ancient underground city or base that you “discover.” Place hidden treasure, old mining gear, or relics from a forgotten civilization, and expand it with rooms that seem to have been lost in time.
   - **Add Secret Rooms**: Hide special rooms filled with resources or lore entries (books) to make exploring more exciting. Perhaps these rooms were created by an old mining guild or a secret society. You could even create traps, similar to ancient ruins, using **Create**'s contraptions.
   
### 5. **Biome Domes Project (Biomes O' Plenty)**
   - Using **Biomes O’ Plenty**, recreate different biomes underground by converting rooms or sections of the mineshaft into different themed "dome biomes":
     - For example, turn one area into a lush **jungle dome** with vines, flowers, and a natural look.
     - Another area could be a **desert dome** with cacti and dry sand, while another could be a **frosty biome**.
   - The challenge will be to create convincing environments underground while using the available biome elements. This project can be done incrementally, and each dome will feel like an accomplishment.

### 6. **Build a Hidden Subway or Train System**
   - Using **Create’s** **train mechanics**, set up a secret subway system that connects different parts of the mineshaft. You could even build out different stations with varying designs, like an industrial stop, a luxury station, or a forgotten ruin.
   - **Railway Tunnels**: Connect distant biomes or other cave systems using underground tunnels that are decorated according to the theme of where they’re located.

### 7. **Power Grid and Machine Network**
   - Use **Mekanism** to set up a large underground **power grid** that powers everything in the mineshaft—lights, machines, smelting systems, and anything else you build. Run cables through the shafts, setting up generators and connecting different rooms for a complex yet satisfying project.
   - **Create Mod Gears**: Use gears and power shafts to create mechanical systems alongside this, making it a mix of mechanical and electrical engineering.

### 8. **Cave Adventure Theme Park**
   - Turn the underground mineshaft into a themed **adventure park** with rollercoasters (using **Create’s train mechanics**) or elaborate **parkour courses** that wind through the caverns.
   - **Adventure Rides**: Make use of **Create’s** mechanical components like **rotating gears, elevators, and crushers** to build unique, working attractions underground.

### 9. **Massive Storage and Sorting System**
   - Create a massive automated **storage system** using both **Mekanism** and **Create** for sorting, storing, and retrieving items. You could even make it so items are deposited in a central room and automatically sent to different storage locations via minecart or conveyor belt.
   - Create an intricate system that handles all your resources efficiently, complete with **mechanical arms** to distribute items across your storage facility.

### How to Get Started:
- Pick a project that excites you and start small. Since you're in **Survival**, resources might be limited at first, but each small accomplishment can help you gain momentum.
- Use the **Create** and **Mekanism** mods to automate aspects of your project as you gather more materials. This will make the process more enjoyable as you automate and optimize systems.
- Focus on **building something functional and decorative**, so even if you're alone, the process of designing and constructing will keep you engaged.

Let me know which of these resonates with you, and I can help you refine the idea further if you want to dive deeper into one!

If you're unable to place glow berries on the underside of blocks, there might be a few possible reasons why it's not working. Let's troubleshoot this:

### 1. **Version Compatibility**
   - **Glow berries** were introduced in **Minecraft 1.17 (Caves & Cliffs Part 1)**. Make sure you're playing on **Minecraft version 1.17 or higher** for glow berries to function properly.

### 2. **Correct Block Type**
   - Glow berries can only be placed on the **underside of solid blocks**. Ensure that you're trying to place them on a block like **stone**, **dirt**, **wood**, or **moss block** (on the underside, not the top).
   - Some blocks like **leaves** or **transparent blocks** won’t allow glow berries to be placed.

### 3. **Creative vs. Survival Mode**
   - If you're in **Survival mode**, ensure you have glow berries in your inventory and that you're right-clicking on the **underside of the block**.
   - In **Creative mode**, the process is the same: hold the glow berries and right-click the underside of a block.

### 4. **Mod Conflict**
   - Since you have mods like **YUNG’s Better Mineshafts** installed, it’s possible there’s a mod conflict preventing the placement of glow berries. Sometimes mods modify the behavior of blocks, which could interfere with the normal mechanics.
   - You can test this by loading a vanilla world or disabling mods temporarily to see if the glow berries work as expected.

### 5. **Alternative Blocks**
   - If you're still having trouble, try using different blocks, such as **stone**, **andesite**, or **cobblestone**, to place the glow berries. Some block types may have issues, so experimenting with various solid blocks can help.

### Next Steps:
- **Check your Minecraft version** to ensure you're on 1.17 or above.
- **Try placing glow berries** on the underside of different solid blocks.
- **Disable any conflicting mods** temporarily to test if mod conflicts are the issue.

If none of this works, it could be a glitch or mod conflict, in which case testing on a vanilla Minecraft version may provide more insight. Let me know if this helps or if you'd like to explore other options!
