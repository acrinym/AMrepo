## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Fortnite song, help me write it. 
I still see your mark when you drop next to me, 
I still help you clutch when you're weak.... 
Your weapons and ammo you'll find in the loot, 


(Continue with lyrics matching the original, but fortnite related like I did)

**TOOL**: Please remember to search the user's documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s a continuation of the Fortnite-inspired lyrics based on the vibe you've started:

---

*I still see your mark when you drop next to me,*  
*I still help you clutch when you're weak.*  
*Your weapons and ammo you'll find in the loot,*  
*And we’ll build up high when they shoot.*

*You keep the medkits, and I’ll take the shields,*  
*In the storm’s edge, we rule the fields.*  
*From Tilted to Frenzy, we conquer the ground,*  
*Victory Royale, no one’s taking us down.*

**Chorus**  
*We fight till the end, with the squad by our side,*  
*In the circle we stand, and we’ll never hide.*  
*They can build up or drop down from above,*  
*But they’ll fall, one by one, with a push and a shove.*

*As the night falls, and the battle grows dark,*  
*I’ll revive you, just follow my mark.*  
*From the skies to the hills, we’re the last in the zone,*  
*Just us and the crown, and we’re bringing it home.*

These lines echo Fortnite's essence, capturing both teamwork and the thrill of the final battle. Let me know if you'd like more verses or specific details included!

**USER**: The original song.... 
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me.
I still feel your touch in my dreams (my dreams).
Forgive me my weakness,
But I don't know why,
Without you it's hard to survive.

'Cause everytime we touch,
I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss,
I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
'Need you by my side.
'Cause everytime we touch,
I feel the static.
And everytime we kiss,
I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go.
'Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle,
Your heart is my sky,
They wipe away tears that I cry (I cry).
The good and the bad times,
We've been through them all,
You make me rise when I fall.

'Cause everytime we touch,
I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss,
I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
'Need you by my side.
'Cause everytime we touch,
I feel the static.
And everytime we kiss,
I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go.
'Want you in my life.

'Cause everytime we touch,
I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss,
I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
'Need you by my side.

Now make it fortnite!

**ASSISTANT**: Here's a Fortnite-inspired version, echoing the original lyrics' rhythm and emotion:

---

*I still see your mark when you drop next to me,*  
*I still hear your shout in my dreams (my dreams).*  
*Forgive me my weakness,*  
*But I don’t know why,*  
*Without you it’s hard to survive.*

**Chorus**  
*'Cause every time we land,*  
*I feel the thrill, man.*  
*And every time we build,*  
*I swear I get chills.*  
*Can’t you hear my heartbeat fast?*  
*I want this to last,*  
*Need you in the fight.*

*'Cause every time we aim,*  
*I feel the static.*  
*And every time we rush,*  
*It’s like pure magic.*  
*Can’t you see my health bar low?*  
*I can’t let you go,*  
*Want you in my squad.*

---

*Your builds are my fortress,*  
*Your shield is my guard,*  
*You’re there when the fights get so hard (so hard).*  
*Through zones and revives,*  
*We've survived them all,*  
*You pick me up when I fall.*

**Chorus**  
*'Cause every time we land,*  
*I feel the thrill, man.*  
*And every time we build,*  
*I swear I get chills.*  
*Can’t you hear my heartbeat fast?*  
*I want this to last,*  
*Need you in the fight.*

*'Cause every time we aim,*  
*I feel the static.*  
*And every time we rush,*  
*It’s like pure magic.*  
*Can’t you see my health bar low?*  
*I can’t let you go,*  
*Want you in my squad.*

**Outro**  
*'Cause every time we land,*  
*I feel the thrill, man.*  
*And every time we build,*  
*I swear I get chills.*  
*Can’t you hear my heartbeat fast?*  
*I want this to last,*  
*Need you in the fight.*

This version keeps the essence of teamwork and excitement from Fortnite, giving it the same emotional impact as the original song. Let me know if you'd like more lines or adjustments!

**USER**: Are Squidward and big the cat played by the same voice actor

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, both Squidward from *SpongeBob SquarePants* and Big the Cat from the *Sonic the Hedgehog* series are voiced by the same actor, Rodger Bumpass. Bumpass is best known for bringing Squidward's sarcastic and somewhat gloomy personality to life, and he also voiced Big the Cat, the lovable, laid-back fisherman, in some of the *Sonic* media.

However, it’s worth noting that while Rodger Bumpass voiced Big the Cat in some early appearances, other actors, such as Jon St. John, have also voiced Big in various *Sonic* games and shows. Voice casting for video game characters often changes across different games and media, but both characters have shared the talents of Bumpass at points in their histories.

**USER**: LOL how do you say that last name

**ASSISTANT**: Rodger Bumpass's last name is pronounced like this:

**"Bum-pass"**

The first part, "Bum," rhymes with "drum," and the second part, "pass," sounds just like the word "pass."
