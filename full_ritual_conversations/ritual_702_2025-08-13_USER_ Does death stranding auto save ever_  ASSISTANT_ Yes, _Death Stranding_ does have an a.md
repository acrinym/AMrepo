## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Does death stranding auto save ever?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, *Death Stranding* does have an auto-save feature, but it doesn't save constantly or in real-time. The game typically auto-saves at specific moments, such as when you complete a delivery, enter certain facilities, or after major story events. You'll often see a small "Saving" indicator in the corner when this happens.

However, because it doesn’t auto-save at every moment, you may lose progress if you stop playing without manually saving first. The game allows manual saves when Sam is in a safe location, like shelters or certain non-hostile areas. It’s a good idea to manually save frequently if you want to avoid redoing sections after challenging missions or long travel sequences. 

Overall, relying solely on auto-save might lead to losing a bit of progress, so manual saves can be a helpful backup.

**USER**: What are those octopus squid bts called?

**ASSISTANT**: In *Death Stranding*, those dark, mysterious, ghostly creatures resembling octopuses or squids are called **BTs**, which stands for "Beached Things." These entities are trapped souls or spirits that roam the world between life and death, causing all sorts of havoc and creating a constant threat for Sam and other characters. BTs come in various forms, some of which do have tentacle-like features, giving them that eerie, otherworldly look.

The larger, more monstrous BTs, which resemble giant squids or whales, are often referred to as **Catchers**. They’re especially dangerous and can appear during intense encounters, requiring Sam to use all his skills and equipment to evade or combat them. These creatures contribute heavily to the game’s unique blend of horror and suspense, as players have to stay alert to avoid detection or escape from their grasp.

**USER**: The cargo on my reverse trike just disappeared and it was vital to a mission. Can I just redeploy the cargo? I also had a companion cube attached to my reverse trike

**ASSISTANT**: In *Death Stranding*, if you lose cargo from your vehicle, it generally won’t disappear permanently unless it’s been left unattended for an extended period or was destroyed. Here’s what you can do:

1. **Check the Map and Scanner**: First, use your scanner (by pressing R1 on PS4/PS5) to check if the cargo fell off nearby. It may appear on your map or nearby in the terrain if it wasn’t destroyed.

2. **Lost Cargo Retrieval**: Sometimes, cargo that falls off gets marked as lost cargo. If it's no longer in the area, you might find it at a Lost Cargo Storage Terminal (usually in the distribution centers or waystations).

3. **Mission-Specific Cargo**: If it’s mission-critical cargo, it should reappear back at the original pick-up point if you abandon or fail the mission. You can then return and retrieve it without penalty, though you may need to reaccept the mission.

4. **Redeploy the Companion Cube**: As for the companion cube, it can’t be redeployed in the exact way normal mission cargo is, but you should be able to pick up a new one from the distribution centers or any facilities that offer it as a reward if it’s lost permanently.

In most cases, mission-critical items are retrievable even after mishaps, so check your surroundings or revisit the mission starting point to regain what you need.

**ASSISTANT**: In *Death Stranding*, if your cargo disappears from your reverse trike, unfortunately, you can't just redeploy it directly. Once the cargo is lost—whether due to being dropped or if the trike is destroyed—the game does not allow you to regenerate that specific cargo.

However, you can check the following options:

1. **Check your Lost Cargo**: Sometimes, lost cargo can be found in the area where you lost it, or it might be in a nearby facility where you can pick it up. If it was vital to a mission, you might find it in a specific spot or at the last location it was dropped.

2. **Mission Failures**: If the cargo was part of a mission and it's missing, you may need to restart that mission from a previous save or reload your last save. If you haven't manually saved, it will depend on the game's auto-save points.

3. **Recreate the Cargo**: If the cargo was generated for a mission, you can usually go back to the relevant location or facility and pick up a new batch of the required items. Make sure to check the mission briefing to see if you can acquire the needed cargo again.

As for your companion cube (the floating cube-like robot), it should still be with you unless it was destroyed or lost in a similar fashion. If it's gone, make sure to check your inventory or the last area where you used it.

Remember to keep an eye on your cargo and trike when navigating the dangerous terrain, as losing vital items can set you back in your journey!

**USER**: Well no, the companion cube was a lost cargo which hadn't been deployed, it was just on the trike. The other cargo was aid to Port knot City. I'm not sure how to get that cargo back because it was on the bike when I put it in the garage and then when I took the bike back out the cargo is gone

**ASSISTANT**: When you store a vehicle in the garage in *Death Stranding*, any cargo attached to the vehicle will indeed be removed, and unfortunately, it doesn’t automatically go back into your inventory. Here’s what you can try to recover that cargo:

1. **Check the Private Locker**: Sometimes, when cargo is removed from a vehicle stored in the garage, it is placed in the Private Locker of the facility where you stored the bike. Head back to the garage at the location where you stored your trike and check both the Private Locker and the Shared Locker. Your aid cargo for Port Knot City and the companion cube might be there.

2. **Lost Cargo Retrieval**: If the cargo doesn’t appear in the locker, you could try checking the “Lost Cargo” category in nearby facilities. Sometimes, the game recognizes it as “lost” cargo if it’s been removed from a vehicle, and it might appear for retrieval in the surrounding area.

3. **Re-Accept the Mission Cargo**: For story or mission-critical items, you can often re-obtain the cargo by returning to the mission-giver location or the originating facility. Check if you can reinitialize the aid cargo mission for Port Knot City; this will vary depending on where you originally picked up the items.

4. **Manual Save Point**: If none of the above work and you haven’t saved since storing the trike, you could reload a manual save before you placed the trike in the garage to recover the cargo in its original state.

Let me know if you need more help with these steps—losing critical cargo can be frustrating, but with a bit of searching, it should be possible to recover or reinitiate it!

**USER**: Yes it all went into my private locker

**ASSISTANT**: Great to hear it went into your Private Locker! That’s definitely a relief, as losing mission-critical cargo in *Death Stranding* can be a real setback. Now you should be able to load up the cargo back onto your reverse trike or into your inventory and continue with the mission to Port Knot City without any issues.

If you run into similar situations in the future, remember that most stored cargo will automatically transfer to the Private Locker of the facility where you stored the vehicle. Safe travels with your deliveries, and good luck with the BTs and rough terrain ahead!

**USER**: I'm trying to get to Port not city and the way station West of Port not City without going through the BT area which is the cremation area and capital not city has a force field around it preventing me from going any other directions to avoid the BT areas. Is there a way out of capital not City without going through the force field that will let me avoid those areas

**ASSISTANT**: Navigating around Capital Knot City and trying to avoid BT areas can be tricky, especially in the early game when the route options are limited. Unfortunately, due to the story progression and world design in *Death Stranding*, you’ll need to pass through some BT territory to reach destinations like Port Knot City. Here are a few suggestions to make this path easier and reduce the risk of encounters:

1. **Route Optimization**: While you can’t entirely avoid BT areas on the main paths, you can often skirt around their edges. Instead of going directly through the BT zone near the incinerator, try staying closer to the outskirts and move quietly. BTs are usually less dense near the edges, which may allow you to sneak around instead of heading straight through.

2. **Use Structures for Shelter**: Look for any Timefall Shelters or other structures built by other players if you’re connected online. These can sometimes provide safe spots where you can rest or wait out Timefall and recharge items.

3. **Stock Up on Tools**: If you have any anti-BT tools, such as Hematic Grenades (available after progressing through certain points), bring them along. You can use these to clear BTs if you’re detected, creating a temporary path through the area.

4. **Vehicle Speed**: If you’re on your trike, you can sometimes power through BT zones quickly, allowing you to dodge their grips if you don’t stop or slow down. However, this can be risky if you aren’t used to steering in these areas, as sudden terrain obstacles can halt your progress.

5. **Wait for Safe Passage**: BT areas sometimes shift and become less populated after a while. If you’re really set on avoiding them, you could wait at a nearby shelter until the BTs recede a bit.

6. **Progress with Story Missions**: If you can’t avoid the BT areas now, remember that later in the game, you’ll unlock more paths, zip lines, and tools that make travel through (or around) these areas easier.

Unfortunately, the force field around Capital Knot City restricts movement to channel players along certain paths, so the BT zones are hard to avoid entirely this early on. Using a combination of stealth and speed should help you manage your trip to Port Knot City with minimal risk. Good luck, and keep an eye on that BB for any alerts—it’s your best early warning system!

**USER**: Can I change my birthday once I've started the game and death stranding because dooms change depending on the birthday that you set up when you start the game

**ASSISTANT**: In *Death Stranding*, once you’ve set your birthday at the start of the game, it’s unfortunately locked in, and you can’t change it later. The birthday you choose affects the DOOMS abilities, though it’s mostly a subtle, flavor-based element rather than something that significantly changes gameplay.

Kojima included the birthday option to add a small atmospheric touch, where characters occasionally reference it, and it’s rumored to slightly alter your sensitivity to BTs based on your DOOMS level, though this effect is minimal and not game-changing. DOOMS abilities mostly relate to your in-game experience rather than drastically altering gameplay mechanics or power levels.

If having a different birthday is important for your experience, the only way to change it would be to start a new save file and set the correct birthday then. However, for most players, the differences are minor enough that restarting might not be necessary unless you’re aiming for a specific, immersive effect.

**USER**: Before you get to Port not City, are there any other weapons besides hematic grenades? I know you can use the 01 and 2 grenades as well but it's hard to store a lot of those when I need to keep the car go for the aid that I'm delivering to Port not City

**ASSISTANT**: Before reaching Port Knot City, your options for dealing with BTs are indeed limited, and you won’t yet have access to firearms or other advanced weaponry. Early on, you primarily rely on hematic grenades, EX Grenades (0, 1, and 2), and stealth to get through BT encounters. Here are a few tips on managing your limited inventory and maximizing the resources you do have:

1. **Prioritize Hematic Grenades**: Hematic grenades are by far your best weapon against BTs at this stage, as they can directly harm or disperse them. Try to carry as many as you can reasonably fit, especially if you expect heavy BT presence. Even a few grenades can make a significant difference in getting through tight areas.

2. **Use EX Grenades Strategically**: The EX Grenades (particularly EX 1 and 2) aren’t directly harmful to BTs but can serve as useful distractions. EX Grenade 1, for example, creates an area that repels BTs for a short time, which can give you a small window to slip by or get into a better position. This can save hematic grenades for situations where you’re forced to directly confront a BT.

3. **Optimize Cargo Layout**: One way to free up a bit more space is to carefully manage the stacking and arrangement of cargo on your back. Use auto-arrange in the inventory menu to efficiently pack your items, which can often free up just enough space for an extra grenade or two. You can also attach some items to your suit or store them on your trike if you have one, which helps balance weight.

4. **Stay Stealthy**: If possible, try to avoid direct confrontation with BTs by crouching, moving slowly, and keeping an eye on your BB and Odradek scanner. Avoiding BTs altogether will help you conserve grenades for moments when you really need them, like when you’re completely cornered or spotted.

5. **Check Lost Cargo and Shared Locker**: Sometimes you can find extra supplies or grenades in shared lockers or from lost cargo placed by other players if you’re online. This can occasionally supplement your loadout, giving you a few extra tools without needing to carry everything yourself.

In the early game, it’s about finding a balance between managing limited weaponry and conserving resources. Once you get past Port Knot City, you’ll gain access to more weapons and tools that make dealing with BTs much easier. For now, though, a bit of careful planning and stealth will go a long way. Good luck with the journey!

**TOOL**: **Assessing an arsenal**

OK, let's see. I’m figuring out what other weapons might be available apart from hematic grenades.

**Exploring inventory options**

The user is seeking guidance on non-hematic grenade options for their journey to Port Knot City, considering cargo space constraints.

I'm trying to identify weapons other than hematic grenades before Port Knot City and strategizing for enemies with limited cargo space.

**Navigating early weapons**

I’m piecing together the player’s limited arsenal before reaching Port Knot City: Hematic grenades and EX Grenades, representing bodily fluids. Managing cargo while confronting BTs and MULEs adds a layer of strategy.

**Managing weaponry and resources**

OK, let me see. The player has limited weaponry before Port Knot City and struggles with cargo space. I suggest conserving weapons, using stealth, and avoiding encounters to manage resources effectively.

**Noting weapon choices**

OK, let me see. In *Death Stranding*, weapons are sparse before Port Knot City, and their usage is mostly allowed, including violent content.

**Noticing grenade shortcomings**

I’m surprised to see that the EX Grenades, made from Sam's bodily fluids, are minimally effective against BTs—distracting them or creating safe zones.

**Preparing for BT encounters**

I’m thinking through minimizing Hematic Grenades for emergencies. Avoiding combat, using PCCs, and optimizing cargo arrangement are key strategies to manage dangerous sections and Timefall.

**ASSISTANT**: Before reaching Port Knot City in *Death Stranding*, your weapon options are indeed quite limited. Besides Hematic Grenades, which are effective against BTs (Beached Things), you have access to the EX Grenades No.0, No.1, and No.2. These grenades are made from Sam's bodily fluids—such as sweat, urine, and other excretions—and have varying effects on BTs. However, they are generally less effective than Hematic Grenades and might not be reliable for clearing BT areas.

Given your cargo constraints due to the aid you're delivering to Port Knot City, carrying a large arsenal isn't practical. Here are some strategies to help you navigate BT territories with limited weaponry and cargo space:

1. **Stealth is Your Best Friend**:
   - **Use the Odradek Scanner**: This device helps you detect BTs. Move slowly and pay attention to the scanner's cues.
   - **Hold Your Breath**: When you're close to a BT, hold your breath to reduce the chance of detection. Be mindful of your stamina meter while doing this.
   - **Crouch and Move Slowly**: Reducing noise and visibility can help you slip past BTs without engaging them.

2. **Carry Essential Weapons Only**:
   - **Minimal Hematic Grenades**: Bring along a small number—maybe one or two—for emergency situations when avoidance isn't possible.
   - **Skip EX Grenades**: Since they are less effective and take up space, you might opt to leave them behind.

3. **Optimize Cargo Management**:
   - **Balance Your Load**: Properly arrange your cargo to maintain balance and reduce stamina drain, which can help you move more efficiently through dangerous areas.
   - **Use Utility Pouches**: If you've unlocked them, utility pouches can store blood bags or small items without adding to your main cargo load.

4. **Avoid Combat Whenever Possible**:
   - **Plan Your Route**: Use the map to find paths that skirt the edges of BT zones or have lower BT activity.
   - **Wait Out Timefall**: BTs appear during Timefall (the game's term for rain). If possible, take shelter and wait until the weather clears to reduce BT encounters.

5. **Utilize Structures**:
   - **Use Player-Built Structures**: If you're playing online, take advantage of ladders, ropes, and shelters left by other players to navigate tricky areas.
   - **Build Your Own**: Carry a PCC (Portable Chiral Constructor) to create structures like bridges or zip-lines, although this might not be feasible with your current cargo needs.

6. **Progress the Story**:
   - **Unlock Better Equipment**: Advancing the main storyline will eventually grant you access to more effective weapons like the Bola Gun and non-lethal assault rifles, which can help in future missions.

7. **Vehicle Use**:
   - **Ride Carefully**: If you're using a reverse trike, be cautious in BT areas. Vehicles can alert BTs but can also help you quickly pass through if used carefully.

8. **Lighten Non-Essential Load**:
   - **Store Unnecessary Items**: Before embarking, place any non-mission-critical items into a Private Locker to free up space and reduce weight.

While it's challenging to navigate BT territories with limited weaponry and cargo space, focusing on stealth and careful planning can make your journey to Port Knot City more manageable. Once you reach Port Knot City and progress further, you'll gain access to better equipment and weapons that will ease future encounters.

Good luck with your delivery, and stay safe out there!

**USER**: I have a reverse trike that I'm bringing with me to carry a cargo on since I can't store all the cargo on my person AKA Sam.. so it's more difficult to avoid the BTS like around the incinerator because there are more keen to hearing it. But again, the trike is necessary to move all that cargo

**ASSISTANT**: Navigating BT territory with a reverse trike does add complexity, especially near the incinerator, where BTs tend to be thick. Since the trike is necessary for carrying all your cargo, here are some tips to help you manage stealth while minimizing BT encounters:

1. **Minimize Noise in BT Zones**:
   - **Dismount Temporarily**: If you’re in a dense BT area, consider parking your trike at the edge of the zone and proceed on foot to scout ahead. If you find a clear route, return to your trike and carefully drive through it.
   - **Slow and Steady**: Instead of revving at high speeds, move cautiously when passing through BT zones on your trike. Keeping the noise level low can sometimes help prevent alerting BTs.

2. **Use a Route with the Least BT Density**:
   - **Map Recon**: Zoom in on your map to chart a path that stays on the outskirts of the incinerator BT zone or hugs terrain features that might let you skirt around. BT density is usually highest near the incinerator’s main paths, so look for alternate routes that let you avoid the center.

3. **Use Cargo Management Wisely**:
   - **Strategic Load Distribution**: If possible, distribute cargo between Sam and the trike to allow for maximum mobility in case you need to abandon the trike temporarily and sneak a portion of the cargo through on foot. After passing the zone, you can retrieve the trike and load it back up.
   - **Essential Cargo Only on the Trike**: Store the heaviest or bulkier cargo on the trike, leaving Sam with lighter items for increased maneuverability in case you need to move quickly on foot.

4. **Use Hematic Grenades to Clear a Path**:
   - **Create a Safe Zone**: Hematic Grenades are highly effective in small numbers. If BTs are blocking the only route, use grenades sparingly to clear the immediate area around your trike, allowing you to drive through without attracting more BTs.

5. **Use Timefall Shelters and Rest Stops**:
   - **Wait Out BTs**: Sometimes, BT areas will recede if you wait out the Timefall. If you’re near a shelter or safe point, take a moment to rest, check your route, and even repair cargo if needed.

6. **Quick Escape Plan**:
   - **Prepare for Evasive Action**: If a BT grabs you or starts chasing, make a quick dash on the trike through the remaining area rather than trying to fight them off. The trike's speed can help you evade their grasp, but make sure you’re steering carefully to avoid getting stuck or knocked off.

7. **Reassess Cargo Needs**:
   - **Consider a Second Trip**: If cargo weight and size allow, consider making two trips, bringing essential cargo to the closest non-BT zone first, then returning with the trike for a second load. It’s time-consuming but sometimes less risky in heavily patrolled areas.

Using the trike in BT zones is challenging, but these tactics can help you strike a balance between stealth and mobility. Getting that cargo to Port Knot City intact is tricky, but with careful planning, you can make it through. Best of luck, and stay sharp out there!

**USER**: Oh, I never thought of sneaking on foot to the location I'm planning to go, dropping some cargo, and then coming to pick it back up with the trike after I get through the zone with the BTS

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, that approach can be a game-changer! Navigating on foot gives you way more control in BT zones, allowing you to move stealthily and avoid detection, especially in areas where using the trike would be too risky. Here’s a step-by-step outline to make this strategy work smoothly:

1. **Scout and Plan**:
   - Dismount your trike at the edge of the BT zone, and then proceed on foot. Use the Odradek scanner to identify BTs and mark out a safe path ahead.

2. **Carry Only Essential Cargo**:
   - Bring only what you absolutely need for the initial trip. This lightens your load, making it easier to crouch, move quietly, and even hold your breath if BTs are close.

3. **Drop Cargo at a Safe Spot**:
   - Once you get through the BT area or reach the closest edge of it, find a sheltered spot (maybe behind rocks or any natural cover) and drop the cargo there. Make sure it’s secure and remember the exact location on your map.

4. **Retrieve the Trike**:
   - Go back to the trike, taking advantage of your pre-cleared path to make the return trip faster and safer. You’re now free to drive it up to your dropped cargo location.

5. **Load Up and Move Forward**:
   - Carefully load the cargo back onto the trike, then proceed on your way. You’ll have the advantage of getting past the worst of the BTs without having to abandon the trike entirely.

6. **Repeat if Needed**:
   - If it’s a large BT zone with multiple clusters, you can repeat this in stages, gradually moving your cargo forward while minimizing the risk of detection.

Using this approach lets you maximize stealth in high-risk areas while keeping the trike nearby for cargo-heavy sections. It may take a bit longer, but it’s a safer and more controlled way to handle those intense BT zones.

**USER**: Because I can't see the bts, not directly, I can only detect them and the oradex scanner points towards them in general, even if there's multiple BTS in one area, the oradex scanner will point in that direction but it won't help me detect multiple BTS in one region

**ASSISTANT**: You're absolutely right—the Odradek scanner can be challenging to use, especially when there are multiple BTs in a single area. Since it only gives a general direction and indicates proximity by pulsing, navigating densely populated BT zones without direct visibility can feel like a game of blind hide-and-seek. Here are some advanced tactics that might help you better handle these situations:

1. **Observe Odradek Pulses**:
   - The speed and intensity of the Odradek’s pulsing give clues about the BT’s distance. If it’s pulsing rapidly, the BT is very close. Slower pulses mean it’s further away. This lets you gauge when to hold your breath and move with extra caution.

2. **Utilize BB’s Emotional Responses**:
   - BB’s emotional state can provide added layers of awareness. If BB starts to stress out (you’ll hear it whimpering or notice more urgent animations), it’s often a sign that a BT is very close. Conversely, a calmer BB means you’re likely a safe distance away.

3. **Move in Short, Controlled Bursts**:
   - Advance a few steps, then pause to let the Odradek recalibrate. This cautious pace can sometimes help reveal multiple BTs in the area since the scanner will redirect to the nearest one when you pause. Gradually shifting direction also allows you to identify a possible clear path.

4. **Use Terrain and Landmarks as Visual Cues**:
   - Though you can’t see BTs directly, you can use environmental cues like rocks, trees, or other landmarks to mentally mark their general locations. This tactic allows you to remember where a BT was last detected and avoid that area as you continue to move forward.

5. **Hold Breath Tactically**:
   - Reserve your breath-holding for when the Odradek is pulsing rapidly or when BB is especially agitated. Hold your breath only as long as needed, as you’ll need time to recharge it if there are multiple BTs ahead.

6. **Monitor Odradek’s Swinging Motion**:
   - The Odradek will physically rotate towards the nearest BT. If it swings sharply in a different direction, it’s picking up on another BT that’s closer. Use this to avoid moving in that direction and to gradually steer toward safer areas.

7. **Use Hematic Grenades as a Last Resort**:
   - If you’re completely surrounded or need an emergency path, a well-placed Hematic Grenade can momentarily clear a BT or two. Just remember, it can attract attention, so move quickly afterward.

8. **Practice Patience in BT Zones**:
   - These areas require a slow, methodical approach, as rushing can easily lead to detection. Instead, try to think of it as a careful puzzle: observe, pause, and adjust based on Odradek’s feedback.

Ultimately, it’s about finding a rhythm of slow movement, observation, and calculated risk-taking. Although indirect, these methods can help you “feel” your way through the BT zones with more control. Hopefully, this makes navigating those intense areas a bit smoother for you!

**USER**: I think the fastest route through is trying to avoid attention in the incinerator area, but remember I have my trike and it's going to be hard to get through that with the BTS being so apt to detect the sound of the trike. You did mention strategic cargo movement on foot and then going back to get my trike, but again I still have to navigate through the BT area on foot and it really would be better to just go with my trike unless I get into BT infested areas where it turns black and it's hard to navigate with a trike and everything gets damaged because of the corralium in that area

**ASSISTANT**: You’re spot on—the fastest route through the incinerator area can indeed be a careful dash with your trike, but with BTs nearby, it’s a risky strategy. Balancing the need for speed and stealth in that area is tricky, especially with the trike drawing extra attention. Here’s a refined approach combining your ideas about strategic cargo movement and using the trike effectively, even through the incinerator BT zone:

### 1. **Plan for a Partial Trike Advance**:
   - Drive the trike up to the **edge of the BT zone** rather than right into the thick of it. This lets you carry cargo through the densest BT patches without risking the noise that attracts them. Once past the main BT density, you can return to the trike and continue.

### 2. **Scout for the Thinnest Part of the Zone**:
   - Instead of taking the trike directly through the entire BT-infested area, look for the narrowest parts of the BT zone or skirt along its outer edges. BTs are often more concentrated in the center of a zone, so moving along the periphery can sometimes offer a cleaner path.

### 3. **Tactical Stops and Quick Restarts**:
   - In less dense areas, try a **stop-and-go approach**. This involves moving forward a short distance with the trike, then stopping and listening carefully. This gives you a chance to assess Odradek’s feedback and make adjustments before committing to a full throttle push.

### 4. **Last-Resort Navigation Through Blackened Areas**:
   - If you find yourself in a spot where the ground turns black and the BT density intensifies, here’s how to handle it:
      - **Dismount and let the trike go** (it’s risky but sometimes necessary).
      - Use **Hematic Grenades** to clear a quick path if needed.
      - Remember, once you’re past the most intense part of the zone, you can retrieve the trike, repair any damage with container spray, and continue.

### 5. **Use the Odradek’s Pulse Range for Quick Checks**:
   - As you advance, let the Odradek pulse frequently. When it detects no BTs close by, you can take advantage of the moment to move forward quickly with the trike. The pulsing gaps can indicate temporary “safe zones” within the area.

### 6. **Prepare for a Rapid Extraction if Necessary**:
   - If things go south and you’re detected by BTs, focus on **quickly dismounting and securing your cargo** rather than fighting. Once you’re past, you can retrieve the trike and any cargo you left behind.

### 7. **Advance in “Hops”**:
   - This “hopscotch” approach is all about covering a bit of ground with the trike, then stopping and reassessing on foot. You don’t need to abandon it entirely—just use it strategically for the trickiest parts and keep it handy as a fallback for larger, cleared stretches.

In summary, treat the trike as an ally rather than an anchor, using it to its fullest where possible and navigating on foot through the densest parts as necessary. This strategy allows you to strike a balance, letting you make efficient progress while minimizing noise and BT detection risk. With a bit of patience and tactical navigation, you should be able to clear the zone and reach your destination with cargo intact.

**USER**: I wouldn't mind setting up or charging station near that which is exactly what I did before I reloaded my last save and now I'm proceeding again back to the incinerator area so that I can get to Port not city. Later in the game do you get structures that deter BTS? Or is it all about weapons that you carry

**ASSISTANT**: In *Death Stranding*, as you progress through the game, you don’t gain structures specifically designed to *deter* BTs directly—BT management is mostly about the tools you carry. However, you do unlock advanced tools, weapons, and upgraded structures that make dealing with BTs a bit easier and help you navigate through their zones more effectively:

1. **Weapons to Combat BTs**:
   - As you progress, you'll unlock a variety of **anti-BT weapons** that make encounters much more manageable. These include advanced Hematic Grenades, the **Bola Gun**, and later, **non-lethal assault rifles** with hematic rounds specifically designed to defeat BTs. Each of these tools gives you more options to handle BTs head-on when stealth alone isn’t sufficient.

2. **Structures that Help Indirectly with BT Zones**:
   - **Safe Houses**: Later, you can build Safe Houses, which provide a sanctuary where you can rest, repair equipment, and even fast-travel. If you’re consistently dealing with BTs in a particular area, setting up a Safe House nearby can help you resupply and strategize without backtracking too far.
   - **Timefall Shelters**: These structures don’t deter BTs but are essential for managing Timefall, which often brings BTs along with it. They also protect your cargo from damage and provide a respite where you can wait for clearer weather if needed.
   - **Zip-lines**: Once you unlock the **Zip-line** structure, it can be a game-changer for bypassing BT zones altogether. Placing zip-lines strategically allows you to “fly” over BT-infested areas without engaging them at all. This structure becomes invaluable later, as it lets you travel quickly across rough or dangerous terrain.

3. **Vehicles with Improved BT Handling**:
   - Later vehicles, like the **long-range reverse trike** or certain **trucks**, offer better durability and battery life. While they won’t avoid BT detection directly, they provide more resilience and can sometimes power through BT zones quickly when combined with upgraded battery stations.

4. **Upgraded Batteries and PCCs**:
   - As you level up, you’ll unlock **higher-capacity batteries** for your gear, allowing you to stay in BT zones longer with more powered equipment. **Advanced PCCs** also allow for better structure builds, so you can set up more robust networks of charging stations and shelters around tough BT areas.

5. **Increased DOOMS Abilities**:
   - Although not a structure or weapon, as Sam’s **DOOMS abilities evolve** through the storyline, he becomes better at detecting BTs and managing those encounters. This provides some natural “deterrent” in the sense that you’ll gain heightened awareness and control over BT zones.

In short, the later game is more about giving you better tools, advanced structures, and faster routes around or above BT zones rather than specific BT-repelling structures. You’ll gain more freedom and flexibility in how you tackle BT encounters, making the journey through these areas less daunting over time.

**USER**: Can you carry vehicles with zip lines or do zip lines just absolve the need for vehicles all together

**ASSISTANT**: In *Death Stranding*, zip-lines don’t allow you to transport vehicles. They’re strictly for Sam to travel quickly over long distances on foot, bypassing rough terrain, BT zones, and even certain MULE territories. 

Zip-lines effectively replace vehicles in areas where you set up a network of lines, especially in mountainous regions or places with frequent BT encounters. However, they’re not a complete substitute for vehicles for a few reasons:

1. **Cargo Capacity**:
   - Vehicles like the **reverse trike** or **truck** have much higher cargo capacity than Sam can carry on foot. If you’re transporting heavy or large quantities of cargo, especially for missions requiring multiple containers, vehicles are still essential. Zip-lines are ideal for getting Sam across the map quickly with a lighter load, but they won’t carry large shipments effectively.

2. **Network Limitations**:
   - Zip-lines have a **maximum range of 300 meters** between points, so you’ll need to carefully plan and place them in a connected network to cover large distances. Vehicles, on the other hand, provide continuous movement across various terrains and don’t rely on Chiral Network coverage or structure placement limitations.

3. **Battery Life and Terrain Challenges**:
   - Vehicles can be challenging to use in certain terrains, like mountains or rugged cliffs, where zip-lines shine. Once you’ve established a zip-line network, you can often move across these areas much faster and more directly than any vehicle could manage.

4. **Combination of Both**:
   - For an optimal setup, many players use vehicles to transport cargo to the edge of a zip-line network, then offload essentials onto Sam and use zip-lines to cover difficult or dangerous terrain. This hybrid approach allows you to take advantage of the cargo capacity of vehicles and the speed and efficiency of zip-lines in one trip.

In summary, while zip-lines greatly reduce the need for vehicles in specific areas, they don’t completely replace them, especially for large deliveries. Using both strategically lets you manage cargo and navigate faster across the diverse landscapes in *Death Stranding*.

**USER**: Well I killed the catcher with hematic grenades and it appears that the incinerator area is clear for now of BTS since the catcher kind of or probably takes all the BTS in the area and consolidates them into that big black mass but without a catcher in the area at the moment it's a lot easier to navigate. The only issue is when my bike got surrounded in the black goo, the items that were attached to it disappeared and I'm not at Capital not city which is where my stuff probably is

**ASSISTANT**: Congratulations on taking down the Catcher! You're absolutely right—when you defeat a Catcher, it temporarily clears out BTs in the area, making it much easier to navigate. This gives you a precious window to move through the incinerator area without constant BT interference.

As for your cargo, when your bike got trapped in the black goo, any items attached to it likely got classified as “lost cargo.” When this happens, the game usually relocates those items to the nearest facility's **Lost and Found** system, which would be at **Capital Knot City** in your case. You can check the **Private Locker** and **Shared Locker** there to see if your items were automatically sent back.

Here’s what you can do:

1. **Proceed to Capital Knot City**: Make your way back there, either on foot or with your bike if it’s still operational. Once there, check the Private and Shared Lockers for any items marked as “Lost Cargo.” They should appear as items that need retrieval or redelivery.

2. **Recover Items in Lost Cargo**: Anything that was mission-critical should still be available to pick up, allowing you to resume your delivery. If for any reason certain items aren’t there, you may need to backtrack to the incinerator area, as they sometimes respawn in the location where they were originally dropped.

3. **Use This Time to Plan Ahead**: Now that you’ve cleared the BTs temporarily, you might consider setting up additional structures (like a recharge station or a Timefall Shelter) in the incinerator area to make future trips easier. This area can be tricky, so having a safe point there could be helpful for later missions.

Recovering your cargo should get you back on track, and with the BTs out of the way for now, it’s a perfect time to take full advantage of the clear route. Happy deliveries, and good luck as you continue your journey!

**USER**: I can't build a timefall shelter yet, that comes after port Knot City

**ASSISTANT**: You're absolutely right—the Timefall Shelter does indeed become available after you reach Port Knot City. For now, without that shelter option, here are a few things you can still do to prepare the route to make future trips through the incinerator area easier:

1. **Set Up Recharge Stations (Generators)**: Since you have access to generators at this stage, you can set them up at key points along the route to keep your reverse trike powered up. Placing one near the incinerator or just before it can ensure your trike has enough charge to move quickly through the BT zones without running low on battery.

2. **PCC Structures for Future Use**: Even if Timefall Shelters aren’t available yet, building additional **PCC structures** like ladders, bridges, or climbing anchors in strategic spots can help you bypass some rough terrain around the BT zone. These can offer alternative routes that allow you to avoid high BT traffic areas, even if it’s not a complete detour.

3. **Leave Spare Gear**: If you want to prepare for a smoother return trip, consider leaving a **few Hematic Grenades or blood bags** in the Private Locker at Capital Knot City. This way, you’ll have quick access to essential supplies for handling any BTs that might respawn later.

4. **Map Out the Route for Future Reference**: Use this time to study the layout of the incinerator area and BT zones carefully, noting which parts tend to have heavier BT density and which areas you can skirt along the edges. Knowing this layout well will make future trips faster and safer.

Once you get past Port Knot City, you’ll have access to more advanced structures like the Timefall Shelter and zip-lines, which will make it much easier to set up safe points and avoid BT encounters. For now, with a generator or two and some strategic planning, you should still be able to make this route work for your deliveries. Good luck on your way to Port Knot City!

**USER**: Well, it's raining again which means timefall which means bts

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, yes—the infamous Timefall strikes again, bringing those BTs back into play. Rain in *Death Stranding* can feel like a real setback, especially when you just cleared a path. Here’s a plan to help you navigate through this Timefall without getting bogged down by BTs:

1. **Wait Out the Timefall (If Possible)**:
   - If you’re near a facility or any kind of shelter, you can take a moment to wait out the Timefall. Timefall zones do shift over time, so sometimes a brief wait can mean the difference between a BT-free path and a treacherous one.

2. **Prepare for Stealth Navigation**:
   - Since the BTs are back, moving cautiously on foot through the denser parts may be the safest option. Follow your Odradek scanner closely, crouch when necessary, and remember to hold your breath if you get too close to a BT.

3. **Advance in Stages with the Trike**:
   - If you have to move with your trike, try moving in short bursts. Drive a short distance, stop to scan, then advance again. This approach can help you avoid accidentally barreling into a BT zone.

4. **Keep Hematic Grenades Ready**:
   - If you’ve got any Hematic Grenades, having a few within easy reach can give you a quick way to clear a small path if you’re in a pinch. Just be mindful of your supply and try to avoid engaging unless necessary.

5. **Use Terrain to Your Advantage**:
   - BTs are often less dense along the edges of Timefall zones. If you can, navigate along natural barriers like rocks or ridges, which can sometimes shield you from direct encounters.

6. **Make a Quick Dash When Possible**:
   - When you see gaps between clusters of BTs, take advantage of them to move quickly across open areas. Sometimes a well-timed dash can get you through without drawing too much attention.

7. **Check Your Route on the Map**:
   - Rain and Timefall tend to come and go, so keep an eye on your map for shifting weather patterns. If you notice a clear section of your path, it can help you plan a safe, direct route through.

If the Timefall and BTs are too overwhelming, waiting them out might be the most strategic option if you’re near a facility. Otherwise, careful, incremental progress can get you through without too much hassle. Hang in there—getting past Port Knot City will definitely give you more tools to handle these zones in the future!

**USER**: I think I have to go back to Capital City to go get my cargo cuz I can't find it out here where I defeated the catcher. Right in the area where I lost my footing and I killed the catcher, my cargo should be there along with everything else that fell off of sam, but I can't find the cargo that needs to be delivered to Capital not City

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like you're dealing with one of those frustrating moments when cargo goes missing after a BT encounter. Typically, if cargo falls off during an intense encounter like a Catcher fight and isn’t visible afterward, it either ended up in the **nearest facility’s Lost Cargo section** or might still be lying somewhere close but harder to spot due to terrain or foliage.

Here’s what you can try to track down that cargo:

1. **Check Capital Knot City’s Lost and Private Lockers**:
   - Since Capital Knot City is the nearest main facility, it’s highly likely your cargo ended up there if it was classified as “lost.” Head back and check both the Lost and Found section and your Private Locker. Important mission cargo sometimes gets automatically redirected to these lockers after a mishap.

2. **Use the Odradek Scanner for Cargo**:
   - If you’re sure it’s nearby, try pulsing the Odradek scanner around the area where you fought the Catcher. The scanner can sometimes detect dropped cargo, which will glow briefly, even if it’s partially hidden in the environment. This can help you locate any scattered items.

3. **Scan the Area More Broadly**:
   - BT encounters can sometimes throw cargo a bit further from where you expect. Walk a little farther around the area where you fought the Catcher, as it might have dropped just outside your immediate line of sight, especially if you were on uneven ground.

4. **Reload if You Recently Saved**:
   - If you saved the game just before the Catcher fight, it might be worth reloading and attempting the fight again. This can sometimes help with bugged cargo that didn’t register properly in the environment.

If the cargo is truly missing and doesn’t appear in any lockers or the surrounding area, it’s possible there was a glitch, and reloading could be your best bet. Otherwise, your safest approach is a trip back to Capital Knot City to check for lost items there. Good luck, and hopefully, you can locate it and complete that delivery without too much backtracking!

**USER**: Yeah it looks like all my lost cargo went back to capital map City because of the BT fight with the catcher

**ASSISTANT**: That makes sense! When cargo is lost during a high-stakes BT encounter, it often gets automatically sent to the nearest facility, especially when it’s mission-critical or if there was a major struggle like a Catcher fight. Heading back to **Capital Knot City** to retrieve everything should get you back on track without the need to comb through the area where the fight happened.

Once you’re there, you should find the cargo in the **Lost Cargo** section or your **Private Locker**. This system is a bit of a failsafe for cases like this, making it easier to recover items instead of risking them being permanently lost in the field.

Good luck with the rest of your journey to Port Knot City, and let me know if you need any more tips along the way!

**USER**: I think I'll build six or so more hematic grenades because that fight with the catcher was crazy and I did kill it after like seven or eight strikes with a hematic grenade but it definitely wasn't easy

**ASSISTANT**: Building a stockpile of Hematic Grenades is a great idea, especially if you’re heading back into areas with BTs and possible Catcher encounters. Those fights can definitely get intense, and having more grenades on hand will give you the upper hand if you’re drawn into another battle. Hematic Grenades are especially valuable because they allow you to deal direct damage to BTs without needing close combat, making it much safer to engage from a distance.

Here are a few tips to make your grenades even more effective:

1. **Aim for Precise Throws**: When you’re up against a Catcher or a large BT, try to aim at its core or weak points, usually glowing parts, to maximize damage. Precise hits can sometimes make the fight go faster and save you some grenades.

2. **Use the Environment**: If you’re in a wide-open area, use structures or natural barriers as cover to avoid getting surrounded by the black goo while throwing grenades. This can help you maintain distance and stay out of reach of the Catcher’s attacks.

3. **Manage Your Blood Bags**: Hematic Grenades use Sam’s blood to damage BTs, so it’s essential to have extra blood bags on hand to avoid risking Sam’s health. When you’re crafting grenades, make sure to also bring a few extra blood bags to sustain you during a longer fight.

4. **Consider a Staggered Approach**: If you find yourself low on grenades during a fight, you can try to retreat temporarily to create some distance. This can buy you a bit of breathing room to regroup and reassess your position for more strategic throws.

With a batch of six or so Hematic Grenades, you’ll be well-prepared for another Catcher encounter or any BTs you come across. Preparing ahead like this will make your journey to Port Knot City much smoother!

**USER**: What I think I'll do is leave my truck at the starting area as soon as I get in the maps region of the incinerator location and then fight the catcher, go get my trike and go back through it this time completing the incinerator traversal

**ASSISTANT**: That sounds like a solid plan! Leaving your truck at the starting area and then tackling the Catcher on foot allows you to approach the fight with greater mobility and precision. Once the BT area is cleared and you’ve taken down the Catcher, you can retrieve your trike and safely navigate through the incinerator region without the constant threat of BTs around every corner.

Here’s how to streamline that approach:

1. **Leave Essential Supplies in the Truck**:
   - Load the truck with backup supplies like extra **Hematic Grenades** and **Blood Bags** so you can quickly resupply if needed. This will allow you to travel light during the fight but still have access to extra resources nearby if the battle becomes drawn out.

2. **Advance Carefully to Trigger the Catcher Encounter**:
   - Approach on foot with just your Hematic Grenades and a couple of Blood Bags. This way, you’ll be nimble and ready to dodge any attacks from the Catcher without risking cargo or a bulky loadout.

3. **Fight the Catcher Strategically**:
   - Since you’ve already defeated a Catcher, you know the drill, but focusing on quick throws, maintaining distance, and using the terrain to your advantage can make this encounter smoother. Keep an eye out for any natural cover in case you need to reposition mid-fight.

4. **Retrieve Your Trike Post-Fight**:
   - Once the area is clear, grab your trike from the truck's location and head back toward the incinerator. With the BTs temporarily gone, you’ll have a much easier time navigating and can carry any cargo without constant interruptions.

5. **Make Use of the Clear Route**:
   - With the BTs out of the way, you’ll be free to cross through the incinerator area and continue on to your destination without further hassle. This clear path will also make it safer to manage any cargo that might have been tough to handle otherwise.

This method combines the best of both worlds—taking down the Catcher unencumbered on foot and then making the delivery with your trike through a temporarily safe route. It’s a strategic and efficient approach to complete the traversal. Good luck out there, and let me know how it goes!

**USER**: Not truck silly, trike

**ASSISTANT**: Ah! Got it—thanks for clarifying! Leaving your **trike** at the starting area before heading into the incinerator zone on foot definitely sounds like a smart approach. This way, you can engage the Catcher without the extra noise or the potential distraction of the trike, making it easier to focus solely on the fight.

Here’s the refined version of the plan with the trike:

1. **Park the Trike Strategically**:
   - Leave the trike just outside the BT zone, in a safe location near the entry point to the incinerator area. This way, it’s easy to return and reload any cargo or supplies you need once the BTs are cleared out.

2. **Go in Light for the Catcher Fight**:
   - Enter the BT zone on foot with only essential items like Hematic Grenades and Blood Bags. This light load will give you greater maneuverability, helping you dodge the Catcher’s attacks and focus on well-placed grenade throws.

3. **Use Cover and Stay Mobile**:
   - Engage the Catcher carefully, using any nearby cover to keep some distance while throwing your Hematic Grenades. Staying mobile will help you avoid getting surrounded by the black goo, which can be especially tricky when fighting on foot.

4. **Return to the Trike Post-Fight**:
   - Once the Catcher is down and the area is temporarily BT-free, head back to your parked trike. You’ll now have the freedom to ride through the incinerator area without risking another BT encounter.

5. **Complete the Incinerator Traversal**:
   - With the BTs gone, navigating on the trike becomes much easier, allowing you to finish transporting any remaining cargo without the usual hassles of Timefall or BT interference.

This approach lets you take full advantage of the temporary BT-free window after the Catcher fight, combining stealth and efficiency for a smoother trip. Sounds like you’ve got a well-thought-out plan—good luck on the traversal, and may it be BT-free!

**USER**: I could even build a post box that I can place on my car go in until I'm finished with the catcher fight so I don't have to find it all over the terrain

**ASSISTANT**: Building a **postbox** is a fantastic idea! This way, you can safely stash your cargo before the Catcher fight, keeping it secure and avoiding the hassle of tracking down scattered items afterward. It also lets you go into the fight with a lighter load, focusing solely on your supplies and weapons for the battle. Here’s how to incorporate that postbox strategy effectively:

1. **Set Up the Postbox at a Safe Spot**:
   - Place the postbox just outside the BT zone, close to where you’re leaving your trike. This ensures that the cargo is accessible both before and after the fight, without risking it getting damaged or scattered in the chaos.

2. **Deposit All Non-Essential Cargo**:
   - Store any cargo that isn’t directly needed for the fight, like delivery items or heavier equipment, in the postbox. Keep only your Hematic Grenades, Blood Bags, and any other fight-related supplies on hand.

3. **Engage the Catcher with a Light Load**:
   - With your cargo safely stored, you can engage the Catcher without the extra weight, letting you dodge and move more freely. After the fight, you’ll have peace of mind knowing that your delivery items are secure.

4. **Retrieve Cargo and Reload the Trike**:
   - Once the area is clear, return to the postbox, collect your cargo, and load it onto the trike. You’ll then be set to proceed through the incinerator area without the usual BT interference.

5. **Consider Leaving Supplies for Future Use**:
   - Since postboxes can hold items indefinitely, you could even leave backup supplies like grenades, blood bags, or container repair spray for any future trips through this area. This way, you’ll have a mini supply cache ready if you encounter BTs again on a return trip.

Using a postbox this way is a smart and efficient solution, giving you a base of operations for both the fight and the cargo management. With this setup, you should have a much smoother traversal through the incinerator zone. Good luck, and here’s to a successful BT-free run!

**USER**: Can I put my trike in the post box? Or is that digital storage not quite available LOL

**ASSISTANT**: Haha, I wish! Unfortunately, the **postbox** hasn’t quite reached “vehicle storage” level yet—no digital storage for trikes in *Death Stranding*! Postboxes are limited to smaller items like cargo, supplies, and resources, so vehicles will have to remain parked safely outside or taken to garages at facilities for storage.

If only we could shrink down trikes and trucks for easy storage! Until then, we’ll just have to rely on good ol’ parking strategies and the trusty postbox for cargo management. Still, stashing your delivery items in the postbox to keep them safe from BT chaos is a genius move. Safe travels on that trike, and may you have smooth roads ahead!

**USER**: Well with DS2 on the way, maybe that will become available with larger upgrades later in the game

**ASSISTANT**: You’re absolutely right! With *Death Stranding 2* on the horizon, it’s exciting to think about all the new upgrades and mechanics Kojima could introduce. Vehicle storage in postboxes or some kind of “miniaturization” tech for trikes and trucks would be an incredible upgrade, making traversal even more flexible—imagine zipping through rough terrain with a compact, carry-able trike that you can deploy whenever the terrain allows.

*Death Stranding* is all about inventive solutions for challenging environments, so Kojima could definitely surprise us with new tools for vehicle management, advanced storage options, or even enhanced structures that make navigating BT zones easier. Maybe we’ll see larger, more versatile storage facilities or even new ways to connect structures that allow for innovative cargo management.

It’s fun to imagine how they could build on the original’s systems to make *DS2* even more immersive and streamlined. Fingers crossed that they introduce some creative solutions for vehicle storage and traversal upgrades!

**USER**: Is there any way to go from Capital not City to the way station West of capital not City

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can definitely travel from **Capital Knot City** to the **Waystation West of Capital Knot City** in *Death Stranding*! This route is part of the early game and is essential for progressing the story. While it may seem straightforward, the journey does present some challenges, especially with BT zones, MULEs, and rough terrain. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this route effectively:

1. **Head West from Capital Knot City**:
   - Exit Capital Knot City and follow the road westward. You’ll see a rough path leading in the general direction of the Waystation. Stick to the route marked on your map, as this will take you along the most direct path.

2. **Prepare for BT Zones**:
   - This path includes BT zones, especially if it’s raining (Timefall). Keep an eye on BB and your Odradek scanner to detect BTs. Move carefully through these areas, and remember to **hold your breath** when a BT is nearby to avoid detection. If you have **Hematic Grenades**, keep them handy as a last resort.

3. **Avoid MULE Territory** (if applicable):
   - Depending on your progress, you may encounter MULEs (human enemies who steal cargo) along this route. They’re typically located further west, so keep an eye out for orange scanner poles that indicate MULE territory. If you do need to pass through, move quickly or use stealth to avoid detection.

4. **Use Terrain and Structures**:
   - The path is hilly and can be tough to navigate on foot or with a trike. Look out for ladders, ropes, and other player-built structures if you’re playing online. These structures can make the trek much easier, especially if they provide alternate routes through tough terrain.

5. **Consider a Postbox for Cargo Management**:
   - If you’re carrying a lot of cargo, you might consider building a **postbox** partway along the route to store or organize items. This can help if you need to lighten your load for BT encounters or MULE territory.

6. **Use a Reverse Trike or Carry On Foot**:
   - The trike can make the journey faster, but it also draws attention in BT areas. You may want to park it near the edge of any BT zones and proceed on foot to avoid alerting BTs.

7. **Recharge if Needed**:
   - If you have a PCC, consider setting up a **generator** along the route. This can keep your trike or other battery-powered equipment fully charged for the return journey or future deliveries.

8. **Arrive at the Waystation West of Capital Knot City**:
   - Once you’re through the challenges, you’ll reach the Waystation West of Capital Knot City. This facility is crucial in the early game for connecting the Chiral Network, enabling you to build structures and access shared resources.

This journey can be a bit tricky initially, but once you get used to the terrain and BT management, it becomes easier. And as you progress, you’ll unlock additional tools and structures that make repeat trips simpler. Good luck, and safe travels across that rugged terrain!

**USER**: Apparently, you can't have quest items on you when you go into your private room

**ASSISTANT**: That’s correct! In *Death Stranding*, any **quest items** or **mission-critical cargo** will automatically be removed and placed in storage when you enter your **Private Room**. The game does this to ensure that critical items aren't lost or damaged while you're resting or recharging, as entering the Private Room replenishes Sam’s health, BB’s stress levels, and restores any depleted equipment or blood bags.

Here’s what you can expect with quest items when entering the Private Room:

1. **Automatic Transfer to Locker**:
   - Any active mission cargo will be moved to the **Private Locker** of the facility where the Private Room is located. You can easily retrieve it once you exit the room.

2. **Check the Private Locker Upon Exiting**:
   - When you’re ready to continue, go to the **Private Locker** at the terminal. Your quest items will be there, allowing you to load them back onto Sam or a vehicle and resume your journey.

3. **Plan Ahead Before Entering the Private Room**:
   - If you’re in the middle of a delivery with time-sensitive or fragile items, it’s best to complete the delivery or reach a good stopping point before using the Private Room, so you won’t need to re-collect and reorganize your cargo afterward.

Using the Private Room is a helpful way to reset, especially before tackling BT areas or long treks. Just remember to check your Private Locker for any mission items before heading back out!

**USER**: Know what I mean is, if you have cargo loaded for a critical mission on sam, it will not let you enter the private room

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, I see what you mean now—yes, you’re absolutely correct! In *Death Stranding*, if you’re carrying **mission-critical cargo** on Sam, the game will indeed prevent you from entering the **Private Room**. This restriction is in place to make sure players don’t accidentally "pause" a time-sensitive or high-stakes mission, as certain deliveries require continuity and need to be completed without unnecessary breaks.

Here’s how you can work around it:

1. **Store Mission Cargo in the Private Locker**:
   - If you need to access the Private Room, you can offload your critical mission cargo into the **Private Locker** temporarily. Once it’s stored, you’ll be able to enter the Private Room without issue. After you’re done, you can retrieve the cargo from the locker to continue your delivery.

2. **Complete the Delivery First**:
   - For time-sensitive missions, it’s often best to push through to the destination before resting. Once you’ve delivered the cargo, you’ll have unrestricted access to the Private Room to rest and restore Sam’s energy and BB’s condition.

3. **Use Intermediate Facilities for Resupply**:
   - If you just need a quick recharge or restock but can’t enter the Private Room, you can often find PCC-built **generators** or **Timefall Shelters** along the route. These can help extend your energy and equipment durability without needing a full Private Room reset.

It’s a bit of a safeguard the game has in place, but storing mission items temporarily in the locker will let you use the Private Room without affecting your active deliveries. Hopefully, this workaround keeps you moving smoothly through those critical missions!
