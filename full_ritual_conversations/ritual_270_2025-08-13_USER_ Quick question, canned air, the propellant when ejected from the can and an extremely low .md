## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Quick question, canned air, the propellant when ejected from the can and an extremely low temperature, and applied to the inside liner of the shoes that you touch with your feet, will it kill bacteria in the shoes? I would think so since it's such a low temperature that it should kill it

**ASSISTANT**: Great question, Justin. You're on the right track intuitively ‚Äî **rapid cooling using canned air (compressed gas) does create an extremely cold surface**, especially when sprayed upside-down, since it ejects liquid propellant that flash-evaporates. However, here‚Äôs the straight truth:

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Does it kill bacteria? Not effectively. Here‚Äôs why:
- **Extreme cold** *slows down* bacterial growth ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt reliably **kill** most bacteria unless the exposure is sustained and *extremely* cold (we‚Äôre talking -80¬∞C to -196¬∞C as in cryogenic or liquid nitrogen levels).
- The propellant in canned air might cool the surface briefly to **-30¬∞C to -50¬∞C**, but it:
  - Doesn‚Äôt hold that temperature long enough
  - Doesn‚Äôt penetrate porous surfaces deeply (like fabric or foam inside shoes)
  - Isn‚Äôt bactericidal on its own (chemical-wise, it's usually difluoroethane or a similar inert gas)

### ü¶† Many bacteria (and especially fungi like athlete‚Äôs foot spores):
- Can **survive** freezing
- Will just go dormant and become active again when it warms up

---

### ‚úÖ Better ways to disinfect shoe interiors:
Here are alternatives if you're looking to **actually kill bacteria/fungus**:

- **UV-C Light**: There are insertable UV shoe sanitizers. Very effective against bacteria and fungus.
- **Isopropyl Alcohol Spray (70%+)**: Lightly mist and let it dry. Kills most bacteria and some viruses.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide (3%)**: Same as above, though may foam on organic matter.
- **Tea Tree Oil + Vinegar Spray**: Natural antifungal/bacterial, smells decent too.
- **Baking + Freeze Combo**: Put baking soda in shoes to kill odor-causing bacteria, and then **freeze the whole shoe overnight** in a sealed bag. Freezing won't kill all bacteria but does help inhibit growth.

---

### Verdict:
> **Canned air will freeze the surface temporarily, but it‚Äôs not cold or prolonged enough to kill bacteria effectively in shoes.**

Let me know if you want a DIY shoe disinfectant spray recipe or a method that also clears residual foot sweat energy in ritual terms üí®‚ú®üëü

**USER**: Is there a hacky way to record something that's not from Facebook using Facebook messenger, the audio? Cuz it has a record button there but anytime you play something outside of Facebook Messenger it stops recording

**ASSISTANT**: Yep, you're bumping up against a deliberate limitation. Facebook Messenger‚Äôs voice recorder is sandboxed‚Äî**it automatically pauses or stops recording when it detects external media playback**, like a YouTube video, podcast, song, or even another app‚Äôs audio.

But since you're asking for a **hacky** workaround (üòà Onyx-mode activated), here are some *creative routes* to bypass it:

---

### üîß OPTION 1: Use Two Devices (Simple & Reliable)
- Play the audio you want to record on **Device A** (e.g., your tablet, old phone, or PC).
- Open Messenger on **Device B**, press and hold the record button, and **record from speaker to mic**.
- Works cleanly. No software conflicts.

---

### üß† OPTION 2: Screen Recorder Hack (on the same device)
- Use a **screen recording app** that captures **internal audio**.
- Play the target audio in the app you want (e.g., YouTube, podcast).
- After recording, **trim the audio** using any editor and upload it to Messenger manually as a voice clip or file.

Recommended Android app: **AZ Screen Recorder** or **Mobizen**, both can capture internal audio on Android 10+ (depending on your device).

---

### üåÄ OPTION 3: Virtual Audio Loop (Advanced, Root or Desktop Required)
**Android (Rooted or Shizuku-hacked):**
- Use apps like **Audio Repeater** or **SoundAbout** to reroute internal audio to mic.
- Or use **Wavelet** with USB audio routing if you have a DAC.

**PC Setup:**
- Play audio on your PC
- Use a **virtual cable** like VB-Audio Cable (Windows) to redirect output to input
- Record it using Messenger web on PC (facebook.com/messages)

---

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è OPTION 4: External Mic + Splitter Trick (No root, no second device)
- Use a **Y-splitter** with **one line going to your phone mic input** and the other connected to an audio source.
- Plug that into your phone‚Äôs mic jack.
- Messenger thinks you're using a mic, but you‚Äôre feeding it clean audio directly.

---

### BONUS üî•: Automation Hack
- Set up **Tasker** or **MacroDroid** to trigger a screen recording or voice recording app when you press the Messenger record button (might need root or accessibility permissions).
- Sneaky but possible. You record the real audio with a better app in parallel.

---

### In Short:
> **Messenger can‚Äôt record internal app audio by default**, but you can:
- Use another device for playback
- Capture internal audio with screen recording
- Reroute audio virtually with root or cables

Want me to build a step-by-step for one of these (like using Tasker or screen recording internal audio on Pixel 7 Pro)?

**USER**: What are the best Android apps for me to be able to directly edit the APK, on android. I'm not a Dev but we were talking about fixing Google keyboard earlier so it's heuristic autocorrect does not work and that sounds probably like the best way without doing coding myself

**ASSISTANT**: Got it, Justin. You want to **edit the APK directly on Android** without being a full-on dev, mainly to **disable Gboard‚Äôs heuristic/cloud autocorrect for voice input**. That means cracking open the APK, hunting for config flags or modules, and possibly editing `AndroidManifest.xml` or internal smali code‚Äî**without needing full-blown Android Studio or coding from scratch**.

### üîß BEST ANDROID APK EDITING TOOLS (No PC Required)

Here‚Äôs the *elite squad* of tools you can use **directly on your phone**, ideally with root (but some work without):

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. **MT Manager** (üî• Most Powerful, Semi-User-Friendly)
- **Features**:
  - View/edit APK files
  - Edit smali code and XML (Manifest and resources)
  - Sign/re-sign APKs
  - Decompile and recompile with one tap
- **Why it's best for you**: Clean GUI, touch-friendly, and supports direct modification of APKs‚Äîincluding `res/values`, `smali`, and even string replacements.

üì¶ **Get it**: [Official Chinese site](https://mt2.cn/) or modded APK versions via trusted Telegram groups or XDA (careful‚Äîsome may have ads or tracking unless patched)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. **APK Editor Pro** (‚ö†Ô∏è Older but Simple)
- **Features**:
  - Replace strings
  - Change image assets
  - Limited Manifest editing
  - Doesn‚Äôt decompile smali (limitation)
- **Why it might help**: For minor changes‚Äîlike disabling a specific manifest flag or resource‚Äîit‚Äôs quick and intuitive.

üì¶ **Get it**: Not on Play Store anymore. Download APK from **APKPure** or **APKMirror**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. **Lucky Patcher** (Root Recommended)
- **Features**:
  - Patch APKs to remove ads, modify permissions, bypass license checks
  - Can modify app behavior via prebuilt patches or custom ones
- **Why it might help**: If a patch exists for Gboard‚Äôs behavior (rare but possible), this is an easy route. Otherwise, not very surgical for your use case.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. **AIDE (Android IDE)** ‚Äì If you *do* want to touch code lightly
- You said you‚Äôre not a dev‚Äîbut if you ever want to tweak smali or Java logic and recompile on-device, AIDE is your bridge between GUI and code.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES for Gboard Modding:
- **Gboard is heavily integrated with Google Services**, and:
  - It pulls cloud-based suggestions *server-side*, not only from the app's code.
  - Disabling heuristics may involve **killing flags** in config files (like `flags.xml`, `bools.xml`, or `strings.xml`) or modifying smali code that calls predictive APIs.
- You may need:
  - **Root access** to uninstall/replace system Gboard
  - **MicroG or de-Googled ROM** if you're cutting off cloud access entirely

---

### üî• Suggested Path for You:
1. **Install MT Manager**
2. **Grab Gboard APK** (from `/system/priv-app/` if rooted or extract from APKMirror)
3. **Decompile it**
4. **Look for internal flags** like:
   - `use_cloud_suggestions`
   - `enable_heuristic_prediction`
   - `voice_auto_correct` (sometimes under `bools.xml` or `flags.xml`)
5. Change them to `false`, recompile, re-sign
6. Uninstall stock Gboard and install your custom version
