**USER**: What can I do with old Vapes other then tossing them. Creative diy ideas?

**ASSISTANT**: Here are some creative DIY ideas for repurposing old vapes:

1. **Miniature Flashlights**: Remove the battery and wiring from the vape, and install a small LED light and button. This can turn your old vape into a handy miniature flashlight.

2. **Decorative Objects**: Use the vape casings to create unique decorative pieces. Paint them, add embellishments, and display them as modern art or quirky home decor items.

3. **Mini Planters**: Convert old vape tanks or cartridges into tiny planters for small succulents or air plants. These can be placed on your desk or windowsill.

4. **Keychain Holders**: Attach a key ring to the vape body to turn it into a stylish keychain holder.

5. **Portable USB Chargers**: Use the battery and electronics from the vape to create a small portable USB charger for your phone or other devices.

6. **Jewelry**: Disassemble the vape and use the small parts to create unique pieces of jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets, or earrings.

7. **Pen Holders**: Use the vape body as a pen holder by removing the internal components and adding a base for stability.

8. **Electronic Project Cases**: If you enjoy electronics, use the vape casing as a project box for small electronic projects or prototypes.

9. **Craft Supplies**: The small parts from vapes can be used in various craft projects, like scrapbooking, model building, or DIY toys.

10. **Steampunk Creations**: Incorporate vape parts into steampunk-themed creations, such as costume accessories, props, or dioramas.

Remember to handle the batteries and electronic components safely, as they can be hazardous. Dispose of any remaining e-liquid properly to avoid environmental contamination.
