**USER**: Hey chat gpt, tell me what each phrase in drop it like it's Hot the song means

**ASSISTANT**: "Drop It Like It's Hot" by Snoop Dogg featuring Pharrell Williams is packed with slang, wordplay, and double meanings. Here’s a breakdown of some of the phrases and their meanings in the context of the song:

1. **"Drop it like it’s hot"** – This phrase generally means to let something go or to “drop it” when the situation gets intense, which can refer to letting loose on the dance floor or responding to a challenging situation with confidence. In the song, it mostly refers to letting loose, flexing, or showing off when the beat or atmosphere heats up.

2. **"When the pimp's in the crib, ma, drop it like it's hot"** – "Pimp" here is a slang term for a smooth or confident person. The "crib" refers to a home or party. Together, it's like saying, “When the cool person arrives, let loose and start dancing.”

3. **"Park it like it's hot"** – This line suggests showing off by confidently settling down or asserting one’s status in a cool, calm way. It can also imply putting your flashy belongings on display when you’re in a particular setting.

4. **"Pop it like it's hot"** – "Pop it" can refer to popping bottles (opening expensive drinks) or showing off something flashy in a lively, celebratory manner.

5. **"I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams"** – Snoop is describing himself as a smooth, laid-back guy with ambitious aspirations, which he pairs with his stylish appearance.

6. **"See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?"** – "Ice cubes" and "Ice Creams" are both slang for jewelry, specifically diamonds. “Ice” is used to describe sparkling jewelry due to its resemblance to ice.

7. **"Eligible bachelor, million-dollar boat"** – Here, Snoop is flaunting his wealth, describing himself as a single man with a yacht worth a million dollars.

8. **"Phantom, exterior like fish eggs"** – "Phantom" refers to the Rolls-Royce Phantom, a luxurious car. The "exterior like fish eggs" line is a way of saying it’s painted a unique color that stands out, potentially pearlescent or iridescent like caviar.

9. **"The inside's peanut butter, outside's jelly"** – This describes the car's color scheme, with the interior and exterior in contrasting tones, like peanut butter and jelly, emphasizing his style and wealth.

10. **"Get an attitude, pop it like it's hot"** – This line suggests responding to someone’s attitude or negativity by confidently showing off, "popping" or expressing one’s confidence or wealth.

11. **"I got the Rolly on my arm and I’m pourin’ Chandon"** – "Rolly" is slang for a Rolex watch, and "Chandon" is a high-end champagne. This line highlights his luxurious lifestyle, with high-end brands and expensive tastes.

12. **"And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on"** – Snoop is referring to his reputation for high-quality cannabis, adding to his image of being in control and successful.

The song’s overall message is about confidence, wealth, and living a lavish lifestyle. Many of the lyrics serve to flex or show off what Snoop Dogg and Pharrell have, both materially and in terms of personal style. The hook, “Drop it like it’s hot,” ties this all together, reinforcing that when things get intense or heated, they’re ready to let loose and keep cool in their own way.

**USER**: Chandon, how is it pronounced

**ASSISTANT**: "Chandon" is pronounced as **"shahn-DAWN"** (IPA: /ʃɑnˈdɒn/). 

The emphasis is on the second syllable ("DAWN"), and the first syllable sounds like "shahn" (similar to the word *"Sean"*).
