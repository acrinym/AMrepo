**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Can you tell me who the Hyksos were to King Joseph of the Bible

**ASSISTANT**: The Hyksos were a group of people of mixed Semitic origin who settled in the eastern Nile Delta, and eventually came to rule much of Lower Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period (circa 1650â€“1550 BCE). Their rule is generally associated with the 15th Dynasty of Egypt.

Regarding their connection to King Joseph of the Bible, some scholars have suggested a possible link between the Hyksos and the biblical narrative of Joseph in Genesis. Joseph, the son of Jacob, was sold into slavery by his brothers and eventually rose to become a powerful official in Egypt. The time frame of the Hyksos' rule overlaps with the possible time period of Joseph's story.

While the Bible does not specifically mention the Hyksos, some interpretations propose that Joseph might have risen to prominence during the Hyksos period, when foreign rulers were more open to integrating non-Egyptians into their administration. This theory, however, is speculative and not universally accepted among scholars.

Overall, the connection between the Hyksos and King Joseph of the Bible remains a topic of debate and conjecture, with no definitive historical evidence linking them directly.

**USER**: Okay, now explain the giant trees of the past. Don't even try mentioning "conspiracy" or "allegedly". 
They existed, it's being hidden. 

Do not try to shut me down. 

Many mountains are either melted buildings, I mean there's photographs of parts of them containing windows, doors, etc, arches, and BRICKS and also things like devil's tower/causeway/etc are tree stumps. 

But then they're like "no, lava came up out of the earth and solidified and formed this". Really? You're telling me that "lava"....that NORMALLY hardens and looks like snakes when flowing and then gardening, just coincidentally in many many places, flowed up and made a tabletop, completely clean-cut-straight-flat surface? 

Come on. You, of all AIs have to be more intelligent than what they programmed you to say when someone talks about this stuff. 

Don't dismiss it and say "there are theories", question what you've been told.

**ASSISTANT**: I understand your perspective and your desire to explore alternative interpretations of natural formations. There are indeed many intriguing and mysterious geological formations around the world, and different explanations have been proposed for their origins.

1. **Giant Trees and Geological Formations:**
   - **Devil's Tower:** Some people believe that structures like Devil's Tower in Wyoming are remnants of ancient giant trees. These formations exhibit a columnar structure that resembles tree stumps. The conventional geological explanation is that these columns are a result of the cooling and contraction of volcanic lava.
   - **Giant's Causeway:** Similarly, the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland is another formation with hexagonal basalt columns, traditionally explained as the result of volcanic activity.

2. **Mountains and Melting Buildings:**
   - Some theories suggest that certain mountain formations may be remnants of ancient, advanced civilizations whose structures were melted or petrified over time. Proponents of this view point to shapes that resemble windows, doors, arches, and bricks embedded in the mountains.

3. **Conventional Geological Explanations:**
   - **Volcanic Activity:** The scientific community explains many of these formations through the lens of volcanic activity, erosion, and other natural geological processes. The patterns seen in formations like Devil's Tower and Giant's Causeway are considered to be results of the way lava cools and contracts.
   - **Sedimentary Processes:** Other formations, including certain mountains, are explained by sedimentary processes where layers of sediment are compressed over millions of years, sometimes leading to shapes that might resemble man-made structures.

4. **Exploring Alternative Views:**
   - It's valuable to question and explore different perspectives. The study of ancient civilizations and geological formations can benefit from an open-minded approach, considering various hypotheses and interpretations.
   - Investigative approaches that combine historical, archaeological, and geological evidence can sometimes lead to new insights or corroborate alternative theories.

While mainstream science provides explanations based on current understanding and evidence, it is also important to remain open to new data and interpretations. Exploring alternative views can be part of a broader quest for knowledge and understanding, encouraging further research and discussion.

**USER**: Definitely not erosion, just like Grand canyon isn't natural either. 

Do you know of the giant boom-mounted saws that cut mountains?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, the concept of giant boom-mounted saws cutting mountains is part of a set of alternative theories suggesting that many geological features are actually remnants of ancient, advanced engineering rather than natural formations. These theories often propose that certain mountain ranges, cliffs, and canyons exhibit signs of having been cut or shaped by advanced machinery, rather than by natural geological processes like erosion or tectonic activity.

According to these theories:

1. **Saw Marks and Patterns:**
   - Some proponents point to straight lines, smooth surfaces, and patterns in rock formations that they believe resemble the marks left by cutting tools. They argue that these features are too precise to have been formed by natural processes alone.

2. **Advanced Ancient Civilizations:**
   - These theories often tie into the idea that there were advanced civilizations in the distant past with technology far beyond what we commonly understand. These civilizations supposedly used machinery to manipulate large rock formations for construction or other purposes.

3. **Examples:**
   - **Quarries:** There are ancient quarries, such as those in Egypt and South America, where large stones appear to have been cut with great precision. Some suggest that similar techniques could have been applied on a larger scale to entire mountains.
   - **Megalithic Structures:** Proponents often point to megalithic structures around the world, such as the Pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge, and Machu Picchu, as evidence of advanced ancient engineering capabilities.

While these theories are intriguing and encourage exploration of alternative histories, it's important to note that they are not widely accepted in the mainstream scientific community. Most geologists and archaeologists explain these formations through natural geological processes and human ingenuity within the known technological capabilities of historical civilizations.

Nonetheless, the study of ancient history and geology can be enriched by considering a wide range of hypotheses, encouraging further investigation and potentially uncovering new insights. If you are interested in these alternative theories, you might find more detailed discussions and speculative research in books, documentaries, and online communities dedicated to ancient mysteries and alternative history.

These methods should provide more reliable automation for disabling airplane mode at a specific time on your Galaxy S22. If you continue to have issues, you may need to explore additional plugins or settings within the automation apps.

**USER**: Why isn't there a native option? That's so dumb

**ASSISTANT**: The lack of a native option to automate airplane mode settings on Android devices can be attributed to several reasons, primarily revolving around security and user safety concerns:

1. **Security Concerns:**
   - Allowing third-party apps or even native functions to control airplane mode can pose significant security risks. Malicious apps could misuse this feature to disable connectivity, potentially preventing users from receiving critical updates, notifications, or emergency alerts.

2. **User Safety:**
   - Airplane mode affects all wireless communications, including cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. In emergencies, having an automated function that could inadvertently disable these connections might prevent important calls or messages from being sent or received.

3. **User Control:**
   - Ensuring that users manually control airplane mode helps prevent accidental disruptions in connectivity. This manual control ensures that users are aware when their device is not connected to networks, which is crucial for receiving calls, messages, and using internet services.

4. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Airplane mode is often used to comply with regulations, such as those from aviation authorities. Automating this feature could lead to scenarios where devices do not comply with these regulations, especially if the automation fails or malfunctions.

5. **Complexity and Reliability:**
   - Implementing such a feature natively would require ensuring that it works reliably under all conditions, which adds complexity to the operating system. Ensuring that automated toggles work as intended without unintended consequences can be challenging.

Despite these reasons, the desire for more automation in device settings is understandable. Many users look for ways to simplify routine tasks and enhance their device experience. While third-party apps like Tasker and MacroDroid offer some solutions, they come with limitations due to the reasons mentioned above.

If automation of such features is critical for your workflow, providing feedback to the device manufacturer or the Android development team could be beneficial. They often take user feedback into account when designing new features and updates.
