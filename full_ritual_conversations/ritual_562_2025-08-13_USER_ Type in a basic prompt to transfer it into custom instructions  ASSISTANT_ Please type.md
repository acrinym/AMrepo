🎵 Title: "In the Atmosphere"

🌊 [Intro: Soft synths, ethereal vocal hums, atmospheric pads]
Waves are shifting, skies unwind...
Silent echoes, lost in time...

🎶 [Verse 1: Light percussion, airy vocal lead]
Faint glow on the water,
Footsteps fading slow.
Signals in the distance,
Tracing lines I’ll never know.

🚀 [Pre-Chorus: Energy builds, deep bassline, tension rising]
Something stirs inside the static,
A pulse I can't ignore.
Every time I reach to find it,
It slips like before.

🔥 [Chorus – Drop 1: Euphoric synths, driving bass, uplifting melody]
You're in the atmosphere, moving all around me.
Shadows in the wake, shifting out of focus.
Everywhere I turn, you're still beside me.
Like a melody, lost between the waves.

🎵 [Breakdown: Soft pads, piano, emotional depth, breathing space]
The edges blur, the colors bend,
The path keeps curving with no end.
Is this a dream? Is this a sign?
Or just a whisper in my mind?

💫 [Bridge: Momentary stillness, vocals floating over a pulsing sub-bass]
Falling forward, weightless still...
Drawn to something past my will...
Close enough to almost hold,
Yet slipping through, a story untold.

💥 [Final Chorus – Drop 2: High-energy peak, layered vocals, final release]
You're in the atmosphere, moving all around me.
Drifting with the tide, somewhere in between us.
Everywhere I turn, you're just behind me.
Like a melody, waiting to be found.

✨ [Outro: Fading synths, reversed echoes, whispering vocals]
Still here… still near… fading…
