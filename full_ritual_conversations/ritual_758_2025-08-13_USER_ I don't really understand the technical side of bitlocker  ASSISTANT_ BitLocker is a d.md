## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: I don't really understand the technical side of bitlocker

**ASSISTANT**: BitLocker is a disk encryption tool built into Windows that helps protect data by encrypting the entire drive. Here's a breakdown of the technical aspects in a simplified way:

### 1. **Encryption & Security**
   - **Encryption Basics**: BitLocker encrypts data on a disk, which means it transforms the data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted (converted back to readable data) with the proper key.
   - **Encryption Algorithm**: It uses **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**, which is one of the most secure and widely used encryption standards. BitLocker typically uses 128-bit or 256-bit keys to encrypt data.

### 2. **Keys & Unlocking**
   - **Encryption Keys**: When you enable BitLocker, it generates a unique encryption key for your drive called the **Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK)**. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt data as it's written or read from the drive.
   - **Protectors**: To unlock the drive, you need to access the encryption key, and BitLocker uses a "protector" to secure this key. Protectors can be:
     - **Password/PIN**: A password or PIN you set.
     - **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**: A hardware security chip in your computer that stores keys securely.
     - **USB Key**: A USB drive containing a key required to unlock the drive.
   - **Recovery Key**: A backup key is created when you set up BitLocker, known as a **Recovery Key**. If you forget your password or there's a problem with your protector (like a TPM issue), this recovery key can unlock your drive.

### 3. **TPM Integration**
   - **What is TPM?**: The TPM is a secure hardware component on your motherboard that can securely store encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations. BitLocker often uses TPM to ensure that the encryption keys are securely stored and not easily accessible by unauthorized users.
   - **BitLocker with TPM**: When BitLocker uses TPM, it can automatically unlock your drive during boot without needing to type in a password (as long as the hardware and boot configuration haven't changed). If something changes (like hardware is tampered with), the TPM will refuse to release the key without additional authentication.

### 4. **Encryption Modes**
   - **Full Disk Encryption**: BitLocker encrypts the entire disk, including system files, user data, and free space. This means everything on the drive is protected.
   - **Used Space Only Encryption**: BitLocker can also encrypt only the used space on the disk, which makes the initial encryption process faster, but any new data written to the disk will be encrypted as well.

### 5. **Performance Impact**
   - **Minimal Performance Hit**: Modern CPUs have hardware support for AES encryption, so the impact on system performance when BitLocker is enabled is generally minimal, as the encryption and decryption happen quickly.

### 6. **BitLocker Modes**
   - **BitLocker To Go**: This is the BitLocker version for removable storage, like USB drives. It works similarly to the standard BitLocker but allows you to encrypt external drives for better portability security.
   - **BitLocker Network Unlock**: For enterprise environments, BitLocker can be set to unlock drives automatically over a network when specific conditions are met, which is useful for IT management.

### 7. **Management & Control**
   - **Group Policy & Command Line Tools**: You can control BitLocker settings through Group Policy (for organizations) and manage it via command-line tools like `manage-bde` or `PowerShell`, which allow more advanced configurations like setting up encryption, changing passwords, and managing recovery keys.

If you have specific questions about BitLocker's usage or setup, I can provide further details on those areas!

**USER**: How much slower is the drive to read/write though

**ASSISTANT**: When using BitLocker, modern systems typically experience **minimal performance degradation**, as the impact is quite low due to hardware-based acceleration of encryption. However, there are some nuances to consider:

### 1. **Performance Impact Overview**
   - **Read/Write Overhead**: In general, BitLocker adds about a **5-10% performance impact** on read and write speeds. This means you may see a slight decrease in the data transfer rate, but it's often unnoticeable during typical use like opening files, browsing, or running applications.
   - **Sequential vs. Random Operations**: BitLocker has a slightly higher impact on **sequential operations** (like transferring large files) than on **random read/writes** (like accessing small files or database transactions). This is because encrypting/decrypting large continuous blocks of data requires more processing power at once.

### 2. **Hardware Acceleration**
   - **Modern CPUs**: Most modern CPUs support **AES-NI (Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions)**, which significantly speeds up the encryption and decryption process. If your system has AES-NI support, the overhead is usually closer to the **5% range** or even less.
   - **SSD vs. HDD**: With **SSDs (Solid State Drives)**, the performance impact is much lower compared to traditional **HDDs (Hard Disk Drives)**, as SSDs have much faster read/write speeds and lower latency. The faster your drive, the less noticeable the impact.

### 3. **BitLocker Encryption Modes**
   - **Used Space Only vs. Full Disk Encryption**: If you choose **Used Space Only** encryption, the initial encryption process is quicker, and since only the data you actively use is encrypted, there's potentially a slight performance benefit compared to **Full Disk Encryption**. However, for most day-to-day operations, both modes have similar read/write performance once set up.

### 4. **Real-World Examples**
   - **Benchmarks**: Real-world benchmarks have shown that on systems with hardware AES support, the **read/write speed drop is around 3-10%** on average. For example, an SSD that typically writes at 500 MB/s might write at around 450-480 MB/s when BitLocker is enabled.
   - **Latency**: The impact on latency (time it takes to access data) is typically negligible, as most of the performance cost comes from the encryption process itself, not the drive’s inherent access speed.

In essence, for most users with modern hardware, the slowdown is small and generally goes unnoticed during normal usage. Heavy disk activities, such as moving large files or using applications that constantly read/write data (e.g., video editing, large database access), might see a more noticeable but still relatively small impact.

**USER**: There are use cases where it would not be a good idea to bitlocker, though the data must remain secure, what are they?

**ASSISTANT**: While BitLocker offers robust encryption and security features, there are specific use cases where using it may not be the best option for securing data. Here are some scenarios to consider:

### 1. **Performance-Sensitive Environments**
   - **High-Performance Applications**: In environments where every millisecond counts, such as high-frequency trading platforms or real-time data processing systems, the slight overhead from BitLocker’s encryption could impact performance. In such cases, other methods of securing data may be preferable.

### 2. **Compatibility Issues**
   - **Legacy Systems**: If you're using older hardware or software that doesn't support BitLocker or has known compatibility issues, implementing BitLocker may cause operational disruptions. Some older systems might experience significant performance degradation due to their inability to handle encryption efficiently.
   - **Cross-Platform Use**: If data needs to be accessed by multiple operating systems (e.g., macOS, Linux), BitLocker’s proprietary nature may create challenges, as it’s primarily a Windows feature. Alternative encryption methods that support various platforms might be better.

### 3. **Data Recovery Needs**
   - **Data Recovery Scenarios**: In cases where data recovery is critical, such as forensic investigations, BitLocker can complicate recovery efforts. If the encryption keys or recovery keys are lost or inaccessible, recovering data from an encrypted drive can become very difficult or impossible.
   - **Hardware Failures**: If a hard drive fails, encrypted data can be more challenging to recover unless proper backup and recovery measures are in place. If the recovery options don't account for encryption, you could lose critical data permanently.

### 4. **Limited User Control**
   - **Need for Granular Access Control**: If you require more granular access control (e.g., file-level encryption rather than full volume encryption), BitLocker might not be the best fit. Other solutions, such as file-level encryption tools, allow for more flexibility in managing who can access specific files or folders.

### 5. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - **Specific Compliance Standards**: Some industries have stringent compliance requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance) that may mandate specific types of encryption or data protection strategies. In such cases, organizations may need to use solutions that meet these specific regulations rather than relying solely on BitLocker.

### 6. **User Experience Concerns**
   - **User-Friendly Environments**: In user environments where users are not technically savvy, the complexity of managing BitLocker (e.g., handling passwords, recovery keys) might lead to user frustration and potential data lockout. Alternatives that offer simpler user interfaces may be preferable.

### 7. **Cloud or Virtual Environments**
   - **Cloud Storage and Virtual Machines**: In cloud environments or for virtual machines, data encryption is often managed at the service level (e.g., using native cloud provider encryption tools). Using BitLocker may add unnecessary complexity since the underlying infrastructure might already provide sufficient data protection.

### 8. **Sensitive Temporary Data**
   - **Temporary Data**: For data that is ephemeral and doesn't require long-term storage (like temporary files or cache), using BitLocker may be overkill. In such cases, secure deletion practices or simpler encryption methods could be more efficient.

### 9. **Publicly Shared Data**
   - **Publicly Accessible Data**: If data must be shared publicly or accessed by multiple users, BitLocker’s full-disk encryption is not suitable. Other solutions, such as using password-protected archives or secure file-sharing services, might be more appropriate.

### Conclusion
In summary, while BitLocker is a powerful encryption tool, certain scenarios may warrant alternative approaches to data security. Evaluating the specific requirements and constraints of your environment can help determine the best method for protecting sensitive data effectively.

**ASSISTANT**: Indeed, while BitLocker is a solid choice for securing data through encryption, there are specific use cases and scenarios where it might not be the best option. Here are a few situations where using BitLocker may not be ideal and alternatives or precautions should be considered:

### 1. **High-Performance Requirements & I/O Intensive Applications**
   - **Scenario**: If your system runs applications that require **high I/O performance** (such as **real-time databases**, **video editing**, or **large-scale virtual machines**), even the small overhead of BitLocker could affect performance. In latency-sensitive environments, such as **financial trading systems**, this slight performance impact might be unacceptable.
   - **Alternative**: Use hardware-based encryption on SSDs that have built-in encryption (known as **SEDs – Self-Encrypting Drives**), which handle encryption/decryption at the hardware level, reducing the impact on CPU and performance.
   
### 2. **Compatibility Issues with Multi-Platform Environments**
   - **Scenario**: If you work in an environment where drives are frequently moved between **Windows, Linux, Mac**, or other systems, BitLocker can cause **compatibility issues**. Native support for BitLocker encryption is not readily available on non-Windows platforms, requiring third-party tools to access encrypted data.
   - **Alternative**: Use a **cross-platform encryption tool** like **VeraCrypt** or **LUKS** (Linux Unified Key Setup) that is designed for compatibility across multiple operating systems while still providing strong encryption.

### 3. **External Drives and Portable Devices Shared with Multiple Users**
   - **Scenario**: For **external drives** or **portable devices** that must be shared frequently with multiple users or across various organizations, managing **BitLocker keys and access control** can be complicated. If the device needs to be accessed on a computer that doesn’t support BitLocker, it could lock users out.
   - **Alternative**: Consider using **BitLocker To Go** for better management of external drives. However, if wider compatibility is necessary, a third-party tool like **VeraCrypt** or **encrypted archives (e.g., password-protected .zip files)** might be more practical.

### 4. **Non-TPM Systems or Inconsistent Boot Processes**
   - **Scenario**: Systems without a **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** chip or that frequently require **boot process modifications** (e.g., booting from USB, dual-boot setups, or using different OSes on the same machine) may face issues with BitLocker’s secure boot requirements and recovery processes. Each time the boot sequence changes, BitLocker may prompt for the **recovery key**, creating an administrative headache.
   - **Alternative**: For systems without a TPM, BitLocker can still be used, but it will require manual password or USB key entry at startup. However, this may not be practical in environments with frequent boot modifications. Alternatively, consider using **software-based encryption** that doesn’t rely on the boot sequence, like **VeraCrypt**, which allows more flexible boot management.

### 5. **Frequent Re-Installation or System Restoration Environments**
   - **Scenario**: If your environment requires frequent **system re-imaging, re-installation, or backup restoration**, BitLocker’s encrypted state can add complexity and time to the process. Encryption/decryption adds an additional layer to backing up and restoring data, as the drive must be unlocked, and imaging software must support BitLocker.
   - **Alternative**: Use a **disk encryption solution that integrates smoothly with your backup and restore process** or consider encrypting sensitive files individually instead of full-disk encryption.

### 6. **Highly Mobile Use with Unreliable or Unpredictable Access to Recovery Keys**
   - **Scenario**: If you are using a device that is often in **high-risk situations**, such as in remote locations or with intermittent network access (e.g., for recovery key retrieval), the risk of being locked out of your encrypted drive increases. Should your TPM lock the drive or require the recovery key, it could be very difficult to access your data without a stable way to retrieve that key.
   - **Alternative**: For critical, field-use systems, consider encryption solutions that do not require regular access to network-based recovery options, or ensure there is a secure and accessible offline method for recovery key management.

### 7. **Shared Workstations or Multi-User Access Requirements**
   - **Scenario**: On shared workstations where multiple users need **access to the same encrypted data**, BitLocker can be cumbersome to manage since it requires a single unlock method, either via password, TPM, or USB key. This could lead to poor key management practices or unauthorized sharing of access keys.
   - **Alternative**: Utilize **file-level encryption** instead of full-disk encryption, so different users can have access to specific files and folders based on their permissions. Tools like **EFS (Encrypting File System)** on Windows, or third-party solutions like **Boxcryptor**, can offer more granular access control.

### 8. **Encrypted Virtual Machines or Containers**
   - **Scenario**: For environments that use **virtual machines (VMs)** or **containerization** (like Docker), encrypting each individual VM or container can sometimes be more effective than encrypting the host drive. If a VM is compromised, an encrypted host drive with BitLocker may still expose some vulnerabilities in the VM.
   - **Alternative**: Use **VM-specific encryption tools** that are designed to secure individual VMs or containers, ensuring that each virtual environment is isolated and encrypted separately.

In each of these cases, while BitLocker provides strong full-disk encryption, the potential downsides involve performance trade-offs, compatibility issues, key management complexities, and scenarios where more flexibility or granularity in access is needed. The key is to weigh the benefits of full-disk encryption against your specific operational needs and choose a solution that best fits your security and usability requirements.

**USER**: A user is accessing a shared drive after having just logged into windows with a smart card, not using the normal username and password that would be used to log on to the domain. The smart card will log on to the domain just as well as username and password. When user logs in, an attempts to access their shared drive which is a shared network drive they're being told the username and password is incorrect. However normally she logs into everything with a link pass which is just a smart card/piv. So how did this happen?

**ASSISTANT**: The issue likely arises due to the

**USER**: Her account got locked out in aduc, but normally she uses her PIV for everything

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like the issue might be related to **credential mismatches** or the **authentication process** that occurs when accessing the shared network drive. Let’s break down potential causes for this situation:

### 1. **Credential Caching and Network Drive Access**
   - When a user logs in using a smart card (PIV), the credentials associated with that smart card are used for authentication. However, accessing a shared network drive may require the system to re-authenticate using domain credentials.
   - If the shared drive is mapped or requires a specific username and password (separate from what the PIV provides), then the user might encounter issues if those cached credentials are out of sync or not properly associated with the PIV login.

### 2. **Account Lockout**
   - The fact that the account is locked in **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)** indicates that there have been multiple failed login attempts, triggering the lockout policy.
   - **Possible Reasons for Lockout:**
     - **Cached Old Credentials**: If the shared drive mapping uses old cached credentials (e.g., a previously set username and password before the PIV was implemented), the system may repeatedly try to use those incorrect credentials to access the drive, causing the lockout.
     - **Mismatch in Certificate Authentication**: If the PIV certificate does not fully align with the domain account's authentication requirements (e.g., certificate mapping issues in Active Directory), then authentication for the network resource might fail, causing repeated attempts and lockouts.

### 3. **Network Drive Mapped with Explicit Credentials**
   - If the shared drive was mapped using explicit domain credentials (a different username and password) rather than the smart card login, then the access attempt may fail if the password has expired, changed, or was incorrectly stored in Windows Credential Manager.
   - Normally, a user logging in with a smart card wouldn’t use their username/password, but if the shared drive mapping explicitly required these credentials, they might still be prompted to use a username and password, which could be incorrect.

### 4. **Kerberos Authentication Issues**
   - Since smart cards utilize certificate-based authentication, they rely on **Kerberos** or **PKI-based protocols**. If there is an issue with the **Kerberos ticket** (e.g., expired, corrupt, or not issued correctly when logging in with the PIV), then access to network resources like a shared drive might fail.
   - **Ticket Issues on Initial Login**: If the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is not issued correctly during the smart card login, any resource that uses Kerberos for authentication, like a shared network drive, will not be accessible.

### **Possible Solutions**
1. **Clear Cached Credentials**: Use **Windows Credential Manager** to clear any old or incorrect saved credentials related to the network share.
2. **Re-map Network Drives**: Disconnect and re-map the network drive using the appropriate credentials or ensure it's set up to use the current PIV-based credentials.
3. **AD Certificate Mapping**: Verify that the smart card certificate is properly mapped to the user's account in Active Directory, ensuring it matches the expected domain account attributes.
4. **Check Domain Account Status**: Unlock the user's account in ADUC and ensure that the lockout policy isn't too sensitive (e.g., few attempts triggering the lockout).

This issue typically stems from a misalignment between the PIV authentication and how the shared drive access was configured. Once the mapping and authentication processes are aligned, the access issue should be resolved.

**USER**: Interesting. Yeah I unlocked the account after identity proofing her, but I don't see any issues with anything in aduc, then again aduc only displays nine tabs by default or 8 tabs, none of which explain how a lockout occurs

**ASSISTANT**: Justin helps unlock accounts and identity-proofs users when resolving issues related to Active Directory.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: That makes sense. ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers) does have limited information on lockout specifics by default. To dig deeper into lockout causes, especially in cases like this, you often need to check **additional logs and tools**:

### 1. **Check Event Viewer for Security Logs**
   - On the **domain controller**, open **Event Viewer** and navigate to **Windows Logs > Security**. Filter for **Event ID 4740** (Account Lockout), which will provide details about which computer or process triggered the lockout, along with the timestamp.
   - Cross-referencing this with the user's activity could reveal if a specific system or service is making incorrect authentication attempts.

### 2. **Use Account Lockout Tools**
   - **Microsoft Account Lockout and Management Tools**: There is a set of tools provided by Microsoft specifically for troubleshooting account lockouts:
     - **LockoutStatus.exe**: Provides detailed information on the locked-out account, including which domain controller detected the lockout.
     - **ALockout.dll**: Helps trace which process on a client machine is causing repeated authentication attempts.

### 3. **Advanced Features in ADUC**
   - Enabling **"Advanced Features"** in ADUC (via the "View" menu) reveals additional tabs and details about accounts, such as **Attribute Editor**, which can help you see more details on the account settings and policies.
   - Though it won't give direct insight into why a lockout occurred, the **"LastLogonTimestamp"** and other properties might help you identify recent activity or potential synchronization issues.

### 4. **Group Policy Review**
   - Check the **Account Lockout Policy** in your Group Policy settings to understand what could be triggering the lockout so quickly. The **threshold for failed attempts**, **lockout duration**, and **reset time** can affect how and when accounts get locked.

### 5. **Verify Credential Management Services**
   - If there are shared drives, printers, or other services the user accesses automatically, verify that all these connections use the **correct credentials**. It's common for old credentials to be cached and continue attempting to authenticate, leading to lockouts.

Using a combination of these tools and logs should give you more detailed insights into the source of the lockout and help you pinpoint the cause beyond what ADUC can show.

**USER**: Is there a way to view that Evtvwr on my admin desktop

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can view Event Viewer logs from a domain controller on your admin desktop by **remotely connecting to the Event Viewer** of that server. Here are a few ways to do that:

### 1. **Using the Event Viewer MMC Snap-in**
   - On your admin desktop, open **Event Viewer** (`eventvwr.msc`).
   - Right-click **"Event Viewer (Local)"** and select **"Connect to Another Computer..."**.
   - Enter the **name or IP address of the domain controller** you want to access.
   - Once connected, navigate to **Windows Logs > Security** on the remote server, just as you would on a local system.
   - You will need to have **appropriate permissions** on the domain controller to view these logs.

### 2. **Computer Management MMC**
   - Open **Computer Management** (`compmgmt.msc`).
   - Right-click **"Computer Management (Local)"** and select **"Connect to Another Computer..."**.
   - Enter the name or IP address of the **domain controller**.
   - Expand **"System Tools > Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security"** to access the logs.

### 3. **PowerShell Remote Event Viewer Access**
   - You can also use **PowerShell** to remotely query Event Viewer logs:
     ```powershell
     Get-WinEvent -ComputerName <DomainControllerName> -LogName Security -FilterHashtable @{Id=4740}
     ```
   - Replace `<DomainControllerName>` with the name of the domain controller you want to access.
   - This command will display lockout events (Event ID 4740) from the Security log of the remote computer.

### 4. **Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)**
   - If direct access is required and available, you can **RDP** into the domain controller from your admin desktop.
   - Once logged in, open **Event Viewer** on the domain controller itself to access the logs directly.

Make sure you have **sufficient privileges** on the domain controller, as accessing Security logs typically requires **domain admin or delegated permissions**.

**USER**: Yeah I don't LOL

**ASSISTANT**: If you don't have the necessary permissions, you might need to work with your **domain admins** or IT security team to gain access or have them export the **Security logs** for you. 

Alternatively, if your role requires access to those logs regularly, you could request **read-only access** to the domain controller's Security logs or see if they can set up a centralized logging system like a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** tool, where you could access the relevant logs without needing full admin privileges. 

In the meantime, having someone with the right permissions check the **Event ID 4740** entries for you is your best bet for getting to the root of the lockout issue.

**USER**: Why is "verb" a prefix or function in powershell?

**ASSISTANT**: In PowerShell, the use of "verb" as part of a command is based on its **"Verb-Noun"** naming convention, which makes scripts and commands easier to understand and more consistent. Here's a deeper dive into why PowerShell uses verbs in this way:

### 1. **Verb-Noun Syntax**
   - **Commands in PowerShell** are known as **cmdlets**, and they follow a standard naming pattern: **`Verb-Noun`**. For example, `Get-Process`, `Set-Location`, `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`.
   - The **verb** describes the action being performed (like `Get`, `Set`, `New`, `Remove`), while the **noun** specifies the object of the action (e.g., `Process`, `Location`, `Item`).
   - This naming convention provides a **consistent and intuitive way** to guess what a cmdlet does. If you want to retrieve information, you'll likely use `Get-*`; if you want to create something, `New-*`.

### 2. **Consistency & Discoverability**
   - PowerShell's built-in cmdlets use **standard verbs** as defined in the [PowerShell approved verbs list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.2). This list is maintained to ensure consistency and **prevent ambiguity**.
   - Using a set list of verbs makes it easy to **discover commands**. For instance, if you type `Get-Command -Verb Get`, PowerShell will list all cmdlets that use "Get" as the verb.

### 3. **Why Verbs?**
   - **Verbs describe actions** and thus make the intent of the command clear. By beginning a command with an action word, it’s immediately evident what the command will attempt to do.
   - This practice aligns PowerShell commands with **natural language**, making it easier for users to learn and remember how to perform tasks.

### 4. **Best Practices**
   - When creating custom cmdlets or functions, it's recommended to use the **standard approved verbs** to keep in line with the consistency that PowerShell provides. For example, use `Get-` to retrieve information, `Set-` to configure or change settings, `Start-` to initiate something, and so on.

In summary, the "verb" prefix in PowerShell cmdlets is part of its design philosophy to promote a **clear, consistent, and intuitive language** for command-line and script-based interactions. By using verbs, PowerShell ensures that commands are action-oriented and easy to understand.

**ASSISTANT**: In PowerShell, the use of a **"verb"** is part of its command naming convention, and it follows a **verb-noun** structure. This design is intended to make commands more intuitive and consistent, aligning with PowerShell's focus on scripting in a human-readable way. Here’s a breakdown of why "verb" is an integral part of PowerShell's syntax:

### 1. **Action-Oriented Command Structure**
   - The **verb** represents the action that the command performs, while the **noun** represents the object or resource that is being acted upon. For example:
     - `Get-Process` – "Get" is the verb (action of retrieving), and "Process" is the noun (the object you're retrieving).
     - `Set-Location` – "Set" is the verb (action of changing), and "Location" is the noun (the directory or path being changed).
   - This structure makes it clear what each command does by explicitly stating both **what** you are doing (verb) and **what** you are doing it to (noun).

### 2. **Consistency and Discoverability**
   - PowerShell has a **standardized set of verbs** that you should use when creating cmdlets. These standard verbs make it easier to learn, remember, and discover commands because they all follow a consistent naming pattern.
   - The verb naming is enforced to ensure that similar actions across different cmdlets use the same verb. For example:
     - `Get-`, `Set-`, `New-`, `Remove-`, `Start-`, `Stop-`, etc.
   - This consistency helps in discovering commands because you can often predict the command name. For instance, if you know that `Get-` retrieves something, you can find all "get" actions using:
     ```powershell
     Get-Command -Verb Get
     ```

### 3. **Best Practices and Readability**
   - Following a **verb-noun naming convention** is considered a best practice for writing scripts and cmdlets in PowerShell, as it enhances code readability and maintainability.
   - It allows scripts to be written in a way that reads more like plain English, making it easier for users and other administrators to understand the intended action.

### 4. **Verb Guidelines**
   - PowerShell uses a set of **approved verbs** that are recommended for use when naming commands, and they fall into general categories like `Get`, `Set`, `Add`, `Remove`, `Start`, `Stop`, `New`, `Write`, `Read`, etc. These guidelines are enforced to avoid confusion, so similar cmdlets share the same action verb.
   - For example:
     - `Get` is used for retrieval and querying.
     - `Set` is used for modifying or configuring something.
     - `New` is used for creating a new resource or object.

By adhering to this **verb-noun convention**, PowerShell achieves both clarity and a standardized approach to command naming, which is beneficial for both script writers and users navigating the extensive set of PowerShell cmdlets.

**USER**: Ah, I see.

**ASSISTANT**: Glad that helped clarify it! PowerShell's structure can seem a bit unusual at first, but once you get familiar with the Verb-Noun convention, it makes working with cmdlets much more intuitive. If you have any more questions about PowerShell or anything else, feel free to ask!

**USER**: What is the current price of a thoroughbred tortoiseshell cat

**ASSISTANT**: The price of a **thoroughbred tortoiseshell cat** can vary widely depending on factors like breed, pedigree, breeder reputation, and geographic location. Here's a general idea:

1. **Breed-Specific Prices**: Tortoiseshell refers to a **color pattern** rather than a specific breed. However, certain purebred cats with tortoiseshell coloring can be more expensive. For instance:
   - **Maine Coon, Persian, or British Shorthair** cats with tortoiseshell patterns can range from **$500 to over $2,000 or more** depending on pedigree.
   - If it is a less common or exotic breed, the price can be significantly higher.

2. **Mixed-Breed Tortoiseshell Cats**: Many tortoiseshell cats are mixed-breed and are often more affordable:
   - Mixed-breed tortoiseshell kittens might cost between **$50 to $200** when sourced from a shelter or local breeder.
   - In some cases, tortoiseshell cats from rescues or animal shelters may be available for an **adoption fee**, typically ranging from **$50 to $150**.

The cost will also depend on the cat's **health status, age, and whether it has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated, or microchipped**. It is best to contact breeders, shelters, or cat adoption agencies in your area to get an accurate price.

**USER**: Can you sing to me yet?

**TOOL**: **Evaluating the request**

The user asks the assistant to sing, which prompts a review of OpenAI's policies to ensure singing and song lyrics are permitted.

**Crafting song lyrics**

Creating original song lyrics is alright, as long as they steer clear of disallowed content. Ensuring factual accuracy and avoiding errors is a must.

**Crafting conversational responses**

I’m assembling responses with a natural, engaging voice, avoiding lists and special formatting. Responses should be contextually apt for the conversation.

**Piecing together a song**

The assistant is crafting a concise, engaging song for the user without mentioning its nature as an AI, adhering to voice conversation guidelines.

**Choosing the right song**

I’m considering a brief, suitable song for the situation. Ensuring it aligns with guidelines and stays concise.

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Here's a little song:

In the sky so bright and blue,  
There's a world meant just for you.  
Every step you take today,  
Brings you closer on your way.
