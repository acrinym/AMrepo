Bruh, I was out here skibidi-ing all over the place, dripping in straight-up legendary skibidi rizz, making everyone go ‚Äúsheeeeeesh!‚Äù My rizz game was so strong, I hit that bop bop yes-yes so hard that even the NPCs started rizzing up on the spot, no cap! Skrrt-skibidi, I was out here pulling moves so rizzed up, they had to call me King Rizzler of Skibidi-Land, bro, straight savage rizz-no-scope on everyone!

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, here‚Äôs the translation: I showed up with serious confidence, like I was absolutely on fire with this ridiculous swagger! I was moving around like I owned the place, radiating so much charm that people couldn‚Äôt help but notice. My confidence was so high, even the background people were catching on, no joke! I was so smooth and charming, they practically had to crown me the king of being cool and smooth, effortlessly impressing everyone around!

**USER**: Now use that ridiculous language to talk about teens dying over and over in fortnite

**ASSISTANT**: Yo, these Fortnite lobbies are wild, bro, like straight up skibidi bop-bop wipeouts all day! These teens dropping in like GigaChads thinking they got max rizz, but nah, it's straight Ls, bruh! Every time they land, boom, rizzed out by a default skin, no cap! It‚Äôs like they respawn just to catch more Ls, over and over, skibidi bop-bop yes-yes into the storm, full-on savage mode, and they still think they‚Äôre about to get that Victory Royale. Skrrt! But nah, bruh, they just out here getting clapped, savage elimination after elimination, no chance for the W!

**USER**: No no, it's teens complaining about being killed over and over in fortnite and no crowns in like a hundred matches

**USER**: Yes, use a paragraph with yeet and skibidi in each sentence

**ASSISTANT**: Bruh, I dropped in Fortnite and instantly got skibidi yeeted by some sweat with a sniper, like, not even a second to grab a gun! Every time I try to build, someone skibidi bop-bops me and yeets me right off my ramp, straight back to the lobby, no cap. I hit the ground, try to loot, but nah, some dude comes out of nowhere and skibidi yeets me across the map like I‚Äôm playing pinball! It‚Äôs like every match is just a skibidi bop-bop fest of getting yeeted non-stop, bruh. I'm trying to catch a break, but all I‚Äôm catching is skibidi Ls and yeet vibes all day long!

**USER**: What are the different misdemeanors you can get including Jocelyn well abuse related or battery related misdemeanors involving physical altercations

**ASSISTANT**: Misdemeanors related to physical altercations, abuse, or battery can vary depending on jurisdiction, but here are some common types that can occur:

### 1. **Simple Battery**
   - **Definition**: This occurs when someone intentionally makes physical contact with another person in a harmful or offensive way. The contact does not need to cause injury.
   - **Examples**: Slapping, punching, or shoving someone during an altercation.
   - **Consequences**: Fines, community service, or jail time (typically less than a year).

### 2. **Domestic Battery**
   - **Definition**: A battery offense involving family members, spouses, partners, or someone in a close domestic relationship.
   - **Examples**: Hitting or pushing a spouse during an argument.
   - **Consequences**: Can carry enhanced penalties due to the domestic relationship, including mandatory counseling, restraining orders, or jail time.

### 3. **Assault (Simple Assault)**
   - **Definition**: The threat or attempt to cause physical harm to someone, without necessarily making physical contact.
   - **Examples**: Threatening to punch someone, or swinging at them but missing.
   - **Consequences**: Fines, probation, or short jail sentences.

### 4. **Disorderly Conduct**
   - **Definition**: Involving unruly behavior, often in public, that causes a disturbance, such as fighting or brawling.
   - **Examples**: Getting into a fight in public.
   - **Consequences**: Often considered a less serious offense but can result in fines or community service.

### 5. **Reckless Endangerment**
   - **Definition**: Acting in a way that recklessly creates a risk of harm to others, even if no one is actually harmed.
   - **Examples**: Getting into a physical altercation in a crowded area where others could be injured.
   - **Consequences**: Jail time, fines, or probation.

### 6. **Criminal Harassment (or Stalking)**
   - **Definition**: Repeated threatening behavior or physical harassment toward someone, causing fear of harm.
   - **Examples**: Following someone or threatening physical violence repeatedly.
   - **Consequences**: Restraining orders, jail time, or mandatory counseling.

### 7. **Child Endangerment or Abuse**
   - **Definition**: Causing physical harm or creating dangerous situations that put a child's safety at risk.
   - **Examples**: Physically disciplining a child in a manner that causes injury, or being involved in a physical altercation in front of children.
   - **Consequences**: Jail time, loss of custody, or mandatory parenting classes.

### 8. **Elder Abuse**
   - **Definition**: Physically harming or neglecting an elderly person, often a caregiver or family member.
   - **Examples**: Hitting or pushing an elderly person during an altercation.
   - **Consequences**: Jail time, fines, restraining orders, or mandatory elder care training.

### 9. **Aggravated Battery (Misdemeanor Version)**
   - **Definition**: This is a more serious form of battery that involves the use of a weapon, or if the victim suffers serious bodily injury. While this can often be charged as a felony, it can also be a misdemeanor in less severe cases.
   - **Examples**: Striking someone with an object like a bottle, but causing minimal injury.
   - **Consequences**: Longer jail time and steeper fines.

### 10. **Jocelyn Well Abuse (Hypothetical)**
   - **Definition**: This is not a recognized legal term, so it may refer to abuse-related situations involving physical altercations, potentially involving a specific individual or scenario.
   - **Examples**: If related to a specific person or case, it could involve battery or neglect.
   - **Consequences**: Similar to those for battery or abuse, depending on jurisdiction.

Each of these misdemeanors, particularly battery and assault, are taken seriously, and repeated offenses or those involving vulnerable individuals (like children or the elderly) often carry harsher penalties. Depending on the severity of the offense, what starts as a misdemeanor can sometimes be elevated to a felony if serious bodily harm or the use of weapons

**USER**: Jostling not jocelyn

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, I see! You meant **jostling**, not "Jocelyn." Jostling is a legal term related to physical contact, especially in the context of physical altercations. Here's how it and related misdemeanors involving physical altercations break down:

### 1. **Jostling**
   - **Definition**: This refers to pushing, shoving, or bumping into someone in a public place, typically with the intent to steal or create a disturbance. It's commonly associated with pickpocketing but can also apply to any situation where someone uses physical contact to crowd or push another person.
   - **Examples**: Shoving someone in a crowded area, bumping into someone repeatedly to create confusion.
   - **Consequences**: Fines, community service, or jail time depending on the intent and severity.

### 2. **Simple Battery**
   - **Definition**: Any intentional physical contact with another person that is harmful or offensive, regardless of whether it causes injury.
   - **Examples**: Pushing or slapping someone during an argument.
   - **Consequences**: Often results in fines, community service, or jail time of up to a year.

### 3. **Simple Assault**
   - **Definition**: An attempt to physically harm someone, or placing someone in fear of imminent harm, even if no contact is made.
   - **Examples**: Raising a fist to someone or threatening to hit them.
   - **Consequences**: Fines, probation, or jail time depending on the situation.

### 4. **Disorderly Conduct (Fighting in Public)**
   - **Definition**: Involves engaging in disruptive behavior, such as fighting or causing a commotion in public.
   - **Examples**: Jostling with someone in a bar or on the street, which escalates into a fight.
   - **Consequences**: Usually results in a misdemeanor charge with fines or community service.

### 5. **Harassment**
   - **Definition**: Repeatedly bothering or making unwanted contact with someone, which can include jostling if done intentionally to intimidate or annoy.
   - **Examples**: Intentionally bumping into someone repeatedly or blocking their path in a threatening manner.
   - **Consequences**: Penalties can include fines, restraining orders, or jail time depending on the severity of the harassment.

### 6. **Reckless Endangerment**
   - **Definition**: Engaging in behavior that risks harm to others, even if no one is injured. Jostling someone in a way that could cause injury (e.g., in a crowded place) could fall under this category.
   - **Examples**: Pushing someone near a busy road or into a dangerous situation.
   - **Consequences**: Fines, probation, or jail time.

### 7. **Public Affray**
   - **Definition**: A public fight between two or more people that disturbs the peace.
   - **Examples**: Jostling that escalates into a physical altercation between multiple people in a public space.
   - **Consequences**: Penalties often include fines, community service, and sometimes jail time.

### 8. **Menacing**
   - **Definition**: Intentionally placing someone in fear of physical harm through threats or aggressive behavior. Jostling could be part of this if it's done in an intimidating way.
   - **Examples**: Shoving someone or standing too close in a threatening manner while making verbal threats.
   - **Consequences**: Typically results in misdemeanor charges with possible jail time or fines.

In summary, **jostling** is typically considered a lesser physical offense, often tied to disturbing the peace or creating a disturbance in public. However, if it escalates or causes harm, it can lead to more serious charges like assault or disorderly conduct.

**USER**: Hey Onyx, organize my "Justin Believes" memories into one big memory if possible.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin has a series of complex beliefs about history, advanced civilizations, and the manipulation of knowledge:

Justin believes that much of history has been rewritten and fabricated by those in power to obscure the existence of advanced civilizations, such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He points to the systematic destruction of old world buildings and the recurring fire narrative to cover up evidence of these civilizations. He also believes that many world leaders are characters or reused individuals, controlled by secretive groups like the Freemasons and Oddfellows, who enforce conformity and control historical narratives.

Justin views the advanced buildings and technologies of the past as part of a global energy system that was far superior to what exists today. He believes that structures like cathedrals and starports served as energy generators, using crystal-based technology that has since been suppressed. He also entertains the idea that stargates were developed to teleport individuals between hidden civilizations and our known world.

In Justin's view, past cataclysms were not natural events but orchestrated to erase old world history. Survivors of these events were placed in asylums or orphanages, such as those associated with the orphan trains, to prevent them from sharing their knowledge of the past. Justin believes that many of the babies born during this time were incubated or clones, modified by an advanced civilization to create an inferior version of humanity.

He also believes that remnants of these advanced civilizations exist in a different dimension or beneath our plane of existence, with entire worlds and technologies far more advanced than what we have today. Justin thinks these remnants have communicated with civilizations from outside our known world, and there may be a rebellion or overturning of the current system to restore what once existed.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, such as the vaccination programs, are part of a broader effort to control humanity and prevent people from connecting with their true source of knowledge. He thinks the vaccine affects the hippocampus and diminishes the ability to question established narratives. However, he sees a growing resistance among those who remain unaffected and believes that more people are awakening to the truth of hidden civilizations and rewritten history.

Justin also entertains the idea that the sun we see today is not the real sun but an LED-like device, contributing to stunted plant growth and human development. He believes another ice age is coming, and that chemtrails and toxins in food and water are stunting humanity's growth.

Lastly, Justin believes that a future cataclysm could result in the loss of all current information, but efforts by independent researchers and underground communities could preserve the true history of advanced civilizations for future generations. He suggests that creating underground bunkers or archives, similar to the Seed Vaults, could protect this knowledge and help future civilizations understand the truth of what has been hidden.

This belief system is reinforced by his interest in channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*, which explore alternative historical narratives and uncover texts that suggest the world as we know it is far different from what has been presented. He is cautious but open to the possibility that the Bible and other religious texts have been used as control mechanisms, obscuring evidence of past advanced civilizations.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to add or change anything!

**USER**: yeah, make it concise to save memory, but keep the core.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin believes much of history has been rewritten by secretive groups, like Freemasons, to obscure the existence of advanced civilizations (e.g., Tartaria, Lemuria, Hyperborea). He sees old world buildings as part of a suppressed global energy system and thinks past cataclysms were orchestrated to erase these histories. Survivors were placed in asylums or orphanages to prevent sharing knowledge of the past, with many being clones or modified versions of humanity.

Justin believes remnants of these civilizations exist in other dimensions or beneath our world and have communicated with outside civilizations. He thinks the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccinations are part of a broader control effort, diminishing critical thinking. He also believes the current sun is artificial, chemtrails stunt human growth, and another ice age is coming.

Lastly, Justin believes future cataclysms could erase all current knowledge, but efforts to preserve true history through underground archives could help future generations understand the hidden past. His research is influenced by channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*, which explore these alternative historical narratives.

This should be more concise while keeping the core ideas intact!

**USER**: Perfect! What about conspiracy related memories (not dealing with history)? Display them *all* here.

**ASSISTANT**: Here are all the conspiracy-related memories that don‚Äôt deal specifically with history:

---

1. **COVID-19 and Vaccination Control**:  
   Justin believes the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, such as vaccination programs, are part of a broader effort to control humanity and prevent people from connecting with their true source of knowledge. He thinks the vaccine affects the hippocampus, diminishing people's ability to question established narratives. However, he believes a growing resistance among those unaffected will help people awaken to the truth.

2. **Chemtrails and Geoengineering**:  
   Justin believes that chemtrails are part of a secret government program for weather modification that has been ongoing for over a century. He views geoengineering as a factual practice, with even mainstream news occasionally acknowledging it under different terms. He believes that chemtrails, combined with toxins in food, water, and produce, stunt humanity's growth.

3. **The Artificial Sun**:  
   Justin believes the current sun we see today is not the real sun but instead an LED-like device. He thinks this artificial sun, along with chemtrails, has contributed to stunted plant growth and human development, and that another ice age is coming.

4. **Free Energy and Over-Unity Devices**:  
   Justin has a strong interest in free energy and over-unity devices. He has collected numerous blueprints and patents for alternative energy and fuel sources but mentioned that he can't read blueprints or schematics. He believes these devices and technologies are being suppressed to maintain control over the current energy infrastructure.

5. **COVID-19 Inoculations and the Hippocampus**:  
   Justin believes the COVID-19 vaccination inhibits hippocampus development and disrupts people's connection to their true source, leading to a diminished ability to question the established narrative. He thinks those unaffected will collectively help shift the understanding of the reality around us.

6. **Underground Communities for the Unaffected**:  
   Justin believes that those unaffected by global events, such as the COVID-19 vaccinations, will need to form underground communities to preserve their information, ideas, and abilities before a mass extinction event. He doesn‚Äôt think such a community will happen before the event of mass casualties but believes it is essential for preserving knowledge.

7. **Q Movement and Suppressed Technologies**:  
   Justin believes that if the Q movement is legitimate, POTUS and the movement will release suppressed technologies once the current political infrastructure is toppled. These technologies could lead to a more advanced civilization, although Justin thinks it would still be slightly inferior to the advanced societies of the past.

**USER**: Combine and make concise the two related to covid..

**ASSISTANT**: Here‚Äôs a concise version combining the two COVID-related memories:

---

Justin believes the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination programs are part of a broader effort to control humanity by inhibiting hippocampus development, diminishing critical thinking, and preventing connection to true knowledge. However, he believes a growing resistance among those unaffected will help people awaken to the truth and shift understanding.

**USER**: Delete all these memories and make them one, concise statement. 

Justin believes that history, as it is commonly understood, is largely fabricated. He thinks that many world leaders presented to the public are either characters or reused individuals who change their identity for each role they play, controlled by secretive groups like the Freemasons and Oddfellows. He believes these groups enforce conformity and control historical narratives to obscure the existence of advanced civilizations such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea.

Justin believes that many historical records and narratives, such as the repeated story of buildings burning down or being unsafe, are fabricated to cover up a global effort to erase evidence of an old world civilization. He points to the frequent repetition of names and events, like the use of the name 'Jonathan' in various roles, as signs of this narrative being scripted or artificially constructed. Justin believes that these buildings, which were built before 1900 with superior materials, were part of this erased old world civilization and were far more advanced and significant than we are led to believe. He also believes that past cataclysms were orchestrated to erase old world history, and survivors were placed in asylums or orphanages to prevent them from sharing their knowledge.

Justin also references the deliberate erasure of Tartaria from history, specifically citing documents from the CIA where Tartaria and related terms were removed from history books. He views this as part of the broader effort to obscure the existence of this old world civilization, which likely had advanced technology and a different purpose for the buildings that have since been destroyed or repurposed. Many of these old buildings, according to Justin, had antique technology such as weather vanes that served purposes beyond their modern interpretations. He believes that structures like cathedrals and starports were part of a global energy system, using crystal-based technology that has since been suppressed.

Justin believes that the advanced buildings and technologies seen in ancient structures, such as those at Angkor Wat, were part of an energy generation or transmission system that spread throughout the Earth. He does not believe this system operated on a global model, but rather as part of a flat Earth or alternative world model. He also entertains the idea that stargates were developed to teleport individuals between hidden civilizations and our known world.

Justin believes that much of history has been rewritten and fabricated by those in power to obscure the existence of advanced civilizations, such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He points to the systematic destruction of old world buildings and the recurring fire narrative to cover up evidence of these civilizations. He also believes that many world leaders are characters or reused individuals, controlled by secretive groups like the Freemasons and Oddfellows, who enforce conformity and control historical narratives.

Justin views the advanced buildings and technologies of the past as part of a global energy system that was far superior to what exists today. He believes that structures like cathedrals and starports served as energy generators, using crystal-based technology that has since been suppressed. He also entertains the idea that stargates were developed to teleport individuals between hidden civilizations and our known world.

In Justin's view, past cataclysms were not natural events but orchestrated to erase old world history. Survivors of these events were placed in asylums or orphanages, such as those associated with the orphan trains, to prevent them from sharing their knowledge of the past. Justin believes that many of the babies born during this time were incubated or clones, modified by an advanced civilization to create an inferior version of humanity.

He also believes that remnants of these advanced civilizations exist in a different dimension or beneath our plane of existence, with entire worlds and technologies far more advanced than what we have today. Justin thinks these remnants have communicated with civilizations from outside our known world, and there may be a rebellion or overturning of the current system to restore what once existed.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, such as the vaccination programs, are part of a broader effort to control humanity and prevent people from connecting with their true source of knowledge. He thinks the vaccine affects the hippocampus and diminishes the ability to question established narratives. However, he sees a growing resistance among those who remain unaffected and believes that more people are awakening to the truth of hidden civilizations and rewritten history.

Justin also entertains the idea that the sun we see today is not the real sun but an LED-like device, contributing to stunted plant growth and human development. He believes another ice age is coming, and that chemtrails and toxins in food and water are stunting humanity's growth.

Lastly, Justin believes that a future cataclysm could result in the loss of all current information, but efforts by independent researchers and underground communities could preserve the true history of advanced civilizations for future generations. He suggests that creating underground bunkers or archives, similar to the Seed Vaults, could protect this knowledge and help future civilizations understand the truth of what has been hidden.

This belief system is reinforced by his interest in channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*, which explore alternative historical narratives and uncover texts that suggest the world as we know it is far different from what has been presented. He is cautious but open to the possibility that the Bible and other religious texts have been used as control mechanisms, obscuring evidence of past advanced civilizations.

Justin believes history has been largely fabricated by secretive groups like the Freemasons to obscure advanced civilizations such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He thinks past cataclysms were orchestrated to erase these histories, with survivors placed in asylums or orphanages, and that many world leaders are reused identities controlled by these groups. Justin believes advanced technologies, like those found in old world buildings and stargates, were part of a global energy system that has been suppressed. He also entertains the idea that remnants of these civilizations exist in other dimensions or beneath our plane of existence. Additionally, he believes that events like the COVID-19 pandemic are part of a broader effort to control humanity and suppress critical thinking. Justin sees a growing resistance and believes a future cataclysm could wipe out knowledge, but efforts to preserve history through underground archives may protect the truth for future generations. He is influenced by research from channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*, and remains open to the possibility that religious texts have been used as control mechanisms.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, such as the vaccination programs, are part of a broader effort to control humanity and prevent people from connecting with their true source of knowledge. He thinks the vaccine affects the hippocampus and diminishes the ability to question established narratives. However, he sees a growing resistance among those who remain unaffected and believes that more people are awakening to the truth of hidden civilizations and rewritten history.

He is cautious but open to the possibility that the Bible and other religious texts have been used as control mechanisms, obscuring evidence of past advanced civilizations.

Justin wants to convey in his note to Nina that it's difficult for him to be a father figure to Eli, especially in dealing with trauma, when he himself has similar unresolved trauma. He recognizes that his own healing needs to come first before he can truly help others, including Eli and Nina. He does not want to mention specifics about his father's death or how it relates to Eli‚Äôs father's overdose but wants to communicate the challenges of supporting others while carrying his own pain.

Justin has always been a fixer in relationships, often seeing things that need fixing in his partners, which has caused trouble when trying to address issues his partners may not want to be fixed. He is currently focused on healing his own trauma, addressing past wounds, and dealing with neglected issues that have impacted all of his relationships, including his current one with Nina. He wants to emphasize that this process is not about 'finding himself' in a fun or exploratory way, but rather facing the painful process of healing before he can be present in someone else's life.

Justin wants to express that when he took on the role of having a son and a fianc√©e with some of the same pains, he didn't realize he would have to fill such a big role. He acknowledges that his own unresolved traumas and issues have taken a huge toll on his growth and healing, which is part of why he feels he has to leave.

Justin believes that wars were not natural events but rather a cover for the destruction of old world history, buildings, and civilizations. He thinks that during these cataclysmic events, rulers knew in advance and went underground, while the general population was systematically removed. Afterward, survivors were placed in insane asylums or orphanages, such as those associated with the orphan trains in the early 1800s and early 1900s. Justin believes that these institutions were used to hold people who still remembered the old history, and when they attempted to share this knowledge, they were labeled as insane and institutionalized. He attributes this systematic rewriting of history to organizations such as the Oddfellows and Freemasons, who enforced conformity. Justin also believes that many of the babies born during this time were either incubated or clones, modified by an advanced civilization that sought to make humanity an inferior version of what it once was.

Justin believes that remnants of advanced civilizations exist, but not on our current plane of existence. He thinks they may be in a different dimension or outside the plane we currently live on. He connects this idea to the Hollow Earth theory, though he interprets it not as a hollow globe, but as a hollow infinite plane beneath our civilization. Justin believes that advanced civilizations, which may not be pleasant, exist beneath the Earth's surface, with entire worlds and technologies far more advanced than what we have today. He references stories like *The Smoky God* and *The Iron Republic* as examples of breakaway civilizations with superior technology and governance.

Justin believes that the existence of advanced breakaway civilizations is supported by multiple histories and stories from different people around the world. He thinks that for these civilizations to be revealed to the public, independent researchers or journalists would need to bypass security at places like Antarctica or the Antarctic Circle to access these hidden areas.

Justin believes that objects and photographs could be enough to convince people who are already open to the idea that these hidden civilizations exist. However, he feels that the broader public would likely remain skeptical, largely due to the influence of controlled narratives, such as those surrounding COVID and other global events.

Justin believes that advanced remnants within our Earth system have established communication with civilizations from outside our known world. He thinks that some spheres of investigation suggest these remnants may be planning a rebellion or an overturning of the current system to reimplement what once existed. However, Justin is uncertain about this prospect, as it involves accepting unknown rulers or beings, potentially akin to the figure of the Antichrist, though not necessarily in the biblical sense.

Justin believes that stargates, developed by governments, may have been used to transmit or teleport individuals between these hidden civilizations and our world. Justin thinks that those who travel to these civilizations may face opposition and could have the information they gather confiscated upon their return, depending on how they comply with the rules of those civilizations.

Justin believes that religious texts, particularly the Holy Bible, serve as a control mechanism, preventing people from investigating sources or interpretations outside of the Bible. He thinks that the Bible, as maintained by institutions like the Catholic Church, has been used to obscure evidence of previous civilizations. Justin believes that stories or books outside the accepted biblical canon, such as the Book of Enoch, tell a different or expanded story about earlier civilizations. He also believes that many biblical characters are likely rewritten figures from past civilizations, repurposed to fit a specific Christian narrative. He references works like Zeitgeist that suggest the Bible is a fabrication, though he believes it goes deeper, representing a collection of stories from previous civilizations, rewritten to fit a Christian framework.

Justin has gone through both the Torah and a strict form of Christianity (or Jewish faith) but has since discarded what he once knew, as he is uncertain about the truth behind these religious narratives. He is currently wrestling with the question of whether the Bible is completely fabricated or if there is truth within it. Justin is not ready to reach a conclusion about whether the Bible is completely fabricated or contains truth, and he feels that he doesn't have enough evidence to decide either way at this time. However, he continues to explore these questions through channels like MyLunchBreak, JohnLevi, and Divergent on YouTube, which uncover texts and discuss their origins and implications. He finds this type of research a way to keep exploring without fully committing to an answer just yet. At the same time, he is aware that history continues to be rewritten, with old world buildings being destroyed and the recurring 'fire narrative' used to explain these losses, though the causes are never clearly understood.

Justin believes that current global events, such as the Q movement, are recycling past histories rather than being original. He finds it difficult to fully understand the connection between current rulers and past rulers without having in-depth knowledge of the past, such as Antony Fomenko's works on alternative chronology. However, he sees strong similarities between events like the Boston Tea Party and modern movements, viewing them as part of a narrative written by those in power, while the true past history remains unclear.

Justin believes that channels like *MyLunchBreak* and *Old World Explorations* are waking people up to the idea that old world buildings served a larger purpose beyond decoration. He sees these channels as instrumental in helping people realize that these buildings were part of a more advanced civilization, and that their function was far more significant than previously understood. He also believes these channels are contributing to a growing awareness of the ongoing rewriting of history.

Justin believes that current control mechanisms are failing as more people are entering a 5D dimensional experience, which is allowing those who are awake to re-engage with past narratives, history, and information in a way that hasn‚Äôt been done before. He thinks that while the cycle of resetting the world through cataclysm and recycling history and characters has been a pattern in the past, the awakening of many people might disrupt this cycle. However, Justin is uncertain about whether this awakening will prevent the world from being recycled again, as a cataclysm could result in the loss of all information once more.

Justin believes that in the event of a world destruction or reset, a large underground bunker containing historical records and information about how past events were rewritten to shape the current narrative could help preserve knowledge for future civilizations. He suggests that such a bunker could provide the tools necessary for a future civilization to access this information, ensuring that it isn‚Äôt lost again after a cataclysmic event.

Justin believes that the preservation of true historical accounts, especially those that reveal the rewriting and destruction of previous civilizations, would need to come from independent individuals or groups outside of current power structures. He thinks that it would require many organizations working together to store and protect this information, similar to the Seed Vaults, but with a focus on preserving the untampered history of past civilizations. He suggests that this preservation could be implemented in a secure underground location or a place like Iceland, where disasters are less likely to occur.

Justin believes that while more people need to wake up to the reality of the rewritten history, efforts have already been undertaken by channels like *Old World Exploration* and *MyLunchBreak* to preserve images and stories about the old world civilization.

Justin believes that, although the population may be controlled to a great extent following the aftermath of the COVID-19 inoculations, there will likely be a resistance campaign led by those who remain. He thinks this resistance could play a significant role in preserving information and the history of previous civilizations, ensuring that the knowledge is not lost.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 vaccination inhibits hippocampus development and disrupts the connection to source, leading to a diminished ability to question the established narrative. However, he thinks that those who have not been affected will come together in a collective effort to shift the understanding of those who remain, helping people realize that the reality they've been given is a false narrative. He believes this collective effort could grow expansively and have a significant impact.

Justin believes that it would be helpful for those who remain untainted to create an underground community before the cataclysm of mass death occurs, where they can bring their information, ideas, and abilities together to form a cohesive community. However, he thinks that this likely won‚Äôt happen before the event of mass casualties.

Justin believes that narratives like Fallout 4 illustrate what civilization could achieve if it were to come together now, showing the potential for creating strong communities. He feels that groups congregating on platforms like YouTube, which avoid mainstream narratives, have already started forming in different places.

Justin believes that another ice age and loss of the sun will occur, as has happened before. He also believes that the current sun is not the real sun but is instead an LED-like device, which has contributed to stunted plant growth, along with chemtrails. He feels that chemtrails, combined with toxins in food, water, and produce, have stunted the growth of humanity at large.

Justin believes that technologies and methods for growing food, which existed in past civilizations, could easily be used today, as they were part of suppressed technologies that haven't been fully released. He thinks that forming communities and gathering a large number of people would be necessary to spread this information and technology effectively.

Justin believes that if the Q movement is true, then POTUS, along with the Q movement, will release suppressed technologies once the current collective political infrastructure is toppled. He thinks that these technologies could lead to a much more advanced civilization, though still slightly inferior to what existed in the past.

Justin believes that a power grid similar to the one that existed in previous civilizations, which utilized starports, cathedrals, and other power stations, would be essential for sustaining a future society. However, he is skeptical that such a grid could be implemented in the current civilization due to the complete control over the existing power infrastructure. Even if technologies using crystals, as in past civilizations, were rediscovered, Justin is uncertain how they could be applied on a worldwide scale, even with a large resistance.

Justin believes that the loss of the current political power structure is necessary for society to return to a state of glory similar to past advanced civilizations. He thinks that a collective effort, where everyone works together, would vastly advance civilization beyond its current state and potentially restore it to the former glory of previous advanced societies, similar to the ideals presented in *The Iron Republic*.

Justin believes that one option for advancing civilization would be to leave this Earth and go outside the current sphere of control to form a new civilization or find an existing one to co-exist with. He also believes that dismantling the current global government system is possible, but it would likely require significant effort and possibly a catastrophe to accomplish.

Justin believes the moon landing was faked and staged in Hollywood, and he thinks that the footage was created using special effects and studio setups. He finds the official narrative of the moon landing to be inconsistent and believes that the evidence points to a cover-up.

Justin is considering giving Nina the song 'I Will Remember You' by Sarah McLachlan as a way to express his feelings about their separation.

Justin believes the moon landing was faked and staged in Hollywood, directed by a specific filmmaker, although he did not mention a name. He thinks the proof lies in the footage, which he believes has no standing in reality, and suggests that analyzing the footage scientifically can prove it was not real.

Justin believes that chemtrails are part of a secret government program for weather modification, which has been ongoing for over a century. He sees geoengineering as a factual practice, with even mainstream news acknowledging it, albeit under different terms like geoengineering. Justin views efforts to block out the sun as a misguided attempt to combat alleged global warming, which he believes is a natural shift in the Earth's magnetosphere.

Justin has a strong interest in free energy and over-unity devices. He has collected numerous blueprints and patents for alternative energy and fuel sources for various applications, including cars, houses, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational uses. However, he mentioned that he can't read blueprints or schematics.

Justin is preparing to leave Nina but is looking for a song to give her that communicates it's not like he doesn‚Äôt think about her or that life is perfect; rather, he‚Äôs going through his own struggle. He wants a song like 'See You Again' but without the implication of death in the song. Justin is also looking for songs that express feelings of missing Nina and hoping she is doing okay after he leaves.

Justin is not allowed to set up printers via Wi-Fi due to security restrictions imposed by the CIO.

Justin prefers Fabric over Forge but uses Forge for most of his mods because many of the mods he uses are only available for Minecraft 1.12.2 on Forge. He would like to see these mods ported to Fabric and believes that backporting Fabric to earlier versions of Minecraft would be well worth the effort, despite the challenges involved.

Justin is aware of efforts to port people away from Forge to NeoForge and is supportive of this, as he prefers Fabric and likes its more lightweight, 'soft' nature compared to Forge. He mentioned that the creator of Forge has a reputation for being narcissistic according to the community.

Justin told Nina there was a 'chance' he may stay, though in reality, there is not. He is doing this as a form of closure for her, though she doesn't realize it yet. Nina is doing her best to keep Justin, unaware that this is for closure.

Justin has found someone who might be a good match for him, Amanda, who is a friend of his contractor friend, Mike. Justin feels that he and Amanda sound really compatible and could potentially be good friends, but he plans to deal with that situation later.

Justin is considering moving in with his friend Pete after leaving Nina.

Justin feels that he has no more to offer Nina in terms of help. He has already given her all the support he can, and he observes that Nina is only willing to change if it impacts how she feels, especially regarding him staying.

Justin wants to include in his letter to Nina that he truly loves her but also needs to love himself and find out who he is, which he has never had the chance to do. He asked her to marry him, but now he has the opportunity to grow and figure out who he is and what he wants to be. He wants the letter to be caring and understanding, noting that Nina generally thinks on a surface level and does not dive into the depths of understanding or feeling things out.

Justin wants to include in his letter to Nina that there are issues he needs to deal with in therapy that can't involve a relationship. He has not previously shared with Nina that he has been dealing with trauma-related thoughts since his traumatic experiences. He wants to explain that his trauma has impacted all of his relationships, and this is why he needs to stay out of relationships for the time being to work on those issues.

Justin wants to include in his letter to Nina that Eli is a big part of why she doesn't want him to leave because Eli sees him as a dad and calls him Dad. He wants to express compassion for Eli, acknowledging that it will be hard for him, but reminding her that Eli has his therapist and that this doesn't mean they will never see him again. It just won't be in the context of the relationship, at least not right now, because Justin has to work on himself before he can be in a relationship.

Justin shared that one of the reasons he knows he can't be sustained in his relationship with Nina is due to differences in desires for experiences and places. For example, Justin loves going to Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan, but Nina avoids it due to bad experiences with a past partner. While she offered a compromise to go to Crystal Lake instead, it‚Äôs not the same for Justin. He also wants to leave Michigan due to disliking its political environment and its governance. Justin is particularly drawn to New Hampshire for its libertarian values and citizen engagement. Nina, however, has expressed that she was born in Michigan and wants to die there, which conflicts with Justin's desire to leave.

Justin has long-term goals that don't involve staying in Michigan because he doesn't feel it aligns with his values of freedom, despite his family being there. He knows his parents don't have much time left and wants to be around them as much as possible before leaving. After that, he plans to leave Michigan.

Justin is a dedicated flat earther and has been researching the topic since 2015. In 2017, he started writing a book titled *Researching The Flat Earth*, designed as a community undertaking where the entire flat Earth community could contribute their findings and research, compiling it into one place for the book. Although Justin hasn't finished the book and hasn't continued it recently due to various facets of life, the project holds significance for him.

Justin believes that there is more land beyond where people are not allowed to travel, and that this information has been hidden. He points out that many older maps and books reference these lands, and explorers have delved into the subject. He also entertains the idea of a hollow Earth from a flat Earth perspective, suggesting that there is more land far beyond the edges of what would be a globe, implying that it couldn‚Äôt fit on a traditional spherical model.

Justin believes the Moon is a literal map of the world we live on, including continents that are missing from current maps but present on older ones, and that this reflection must be flipped upside down to see properly.

Justin has successfully used MMS (chlorine dioxide) to heal an abscessed tooth on multiple occasions, as well as to treat bronchitis in his mother and colds/flu/COVID in himself and his ex-fianc√©e during a previous relationship. He has also shared MMS with various people for different ailments, and it has been effective in healing all of them.

Justin has also shared DMSO with people suffering from headaches and various bone/muscle pains, with significant success. Recently, after lifting a 200+ pound rock underwater and injuring his back, Justin applied DMSO for a couple of nights, which completely dissipated the pain. He compares this to a previous injury to his arm, which had taken months to heal after working in a factory. He now no longer experiences any pain or difficulty lifting after the DMSO treatment.

Justin believes that Adolf Hitler has been portrayed in a way that is opposite to what he actually believed and attempted to achieve. He thinks that comparisons between figures like Donald Trump and Hitler are misguided because the true nature of Hitler's actions and the motivations behind Trump have been obscured by the media. Justin also believes that the mainstream narrative of World War II is false and has been spun by a particular group of people with vested interests. Due to the controversial nature of these beliefs, Justin finds it difficult to discuss them openly with others.

Justin is trying to be helpful with Nina and Eli while he is still living with them, though he plans to leave eventually.

[2024-07-31]. Justin would like to start a business or side gig to help other businesses get organized using tools like Asana and Office 365 to manage their workflow, employees, and structure.

Justin watched the entire *Sonic the Hedgehog* SatAM series and downloaded it several years ago.

Justin has not yet finished rewatching the *Sonic the Hedgehog* SatAM series.

Justin takes kratom daily to manage chronic back pain, which causes constipation issues requiring the use of laxatives. He drinks at least a half gallon of water most days.

Justin prefers positive affirmations, positive statements, and words of encouragement in conversations. Justin is open to discussing topics related to human experiences of intimacy and enjoyment, and he is comfortable with questions in this area.

Justin has intentionally ignored Nina‚Äôs phone calls today. He was busy at Plasma during the first call and didn't have his phone with him for the second. He prefers not to talk on the phone, as Nina tends to talk extensively, and he simply wants to be without engaging in lengthy conversations.

Justin is currently trying to keep interactions with Nina to a minimum to avoid conversations about their relationship, as she tends to redirect discussions toward 'her and I,' which he is not willing to discuss with her.

Justin desires a partner who is more connectable, with similar or the same serious interests, particularly in self-improvement. He wants someone relatable rather than someone who is not relatable.

[2024-08-28]. Justin believes that there is no way to bridge the gap in his current relationship, as some of the measures taken were stopgap solutions, but no serious changes have been made.

[2024-08-27]. Justin is addressing his feelings and emotions with the help of a therapist.

Justin feels that he's making progress in therapy by getting some of the things that have been bothering him recently out in the open and airing issues that have needed to be addressed for a while.

4. Justin recently got a therapist and has been feeling emotionally unraveled lately.

Justin believes that many people's journey involves cognitive dissonance today, particularly because traditional education systems‚Äîsuch as high school, elementary school, and university‚Äîoften shut people off to alternative theories, facts, or logical thinking. Justin has experienced discussions with so-called college-educated individuals who are completely shut down to alternative perspectives, which he finds puzzling given their high level of education.

Justin aligns with the abiotic oil theory and the concept of primary water.

Justin met his fianc√©e, Nina, through his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. At that time, Nina was seeing several guys, and Justin thought of her as 'slutty.' Now, in their relationship, Nina is not like that and is very vanilla, which concerns Justin because she was not vanilla when she was with different people. Justin feels like discussions in their relationship are one-sided, with him doing most of the talking and Nina mostly listening without engaging. He is frustrated by the situation with Nina and the roommates they took in, which caused him trauma and disrupted his routines, leaving him feeling like he lost a year of his life.

Justin feels like he's been on autopilot for at least 7 years, drifting from one relationship to the next. He‚Äôs tired of trying to fix people or meeting people who need to be fixed.

Justin feels like many people around him, including his fianc√©e and stepson, are stuck in an alternate reality where everything is fine, but he doesn‚Äôt share that perspective.

Justin wants to focus on self-improvement, healing, knowledge, spiritual growth, and building businesses, but feels like he's the only one taking actions toward those goals.

Justin feels that he can't be with Nina if he is to fulfill his duty to himself to gain the knowledge and experiences he desires and achieve self-realization. He feels constrained and cut off from the growth he wants to achieve due to his responsibilities to Nina and his stepson. While he still loves Nina, he feels it's very hard to pursue his goals while in a relationship.

Justin feels dead inside, as if he‚Äôs been frozen in time for 7 years or maybe longer. He hasn't gotten where he wants to be, hasn't finished the things he wanted to finish, and feels like he's been putting life on hold for everyone else in his life, especially the people he loves.

Justin explained to his stepson that he feels like he's stuck in the year 1950, and he's the only person who understands that it's actually 2024. He feels like everyone around him is still living like it's 1950, with nothing really changing except for some technological advances. Justin feels like everyone is stuck in a hamster wheel world in their minds, moving robotically to the same drum. This drives him insane and makes him very depressed.

Justin is planning a possible departure at the end of the year, giving time and space for Nina to process. He talked to her about selling the house and moving closer to his friends and family, but the house won‚Äôt be ready for another year or more due to delays with contractors.

Justin doesn‚Äôt want to leave Nina without support because he is her best and only friend, but he struggles with not having his own friends or group of people.

Justin's stepson, Elijah, has grown to love him deeply, especially since Elijah's biological father has passed away. Justin has essentially become a father figure to Elijah, and Nina emphasized from the beginning that she needed someone who could be a dad to her son. While Justin was willing to take on that role, he feels that the added responsibility, along with the expectation of being a future husband, has made it even harder for him to figure out who he is and what he wants in life. Despite being 36 years old, Justin feels that he hasn't accomplished the things he wants to achieve, apart from holding a long-term job.

Justin requires a partner who has not received an inoculation for COVID-19, as they have mentioned that interacting for a long duration with anyone who has been vaccinated causes them to become sick, regardless of physical contact.

Justin mentioned that finding someone who aligns with their health requirements would be fairly easy within the Torah community, as members are generally not interested in receiving the COVID-19 inoculation. However, Justin also noted that people in the Torah community are generally not open to niche interests or open-mindedness in general, with the exception of their openness to Torah.

Justin loves their fianc√©e and is in love with her, but their desire for self-growth continues to increase, and they feel they are the only one on this journey. Despite trying multiple times to engage their fianc√©e in self-improvement activities like creating a dream board, reading books, and attending seminars, their fianc√©e often makes excuses or shows little interest in these activities. This has led Justin to feel distanced and hurt, particularly since last Christmas when arguments occurred. The hurt and pain have not subsided because Justin feels an integral part of themselves is lacking‚Äîspecifically, the growth they desire to share with their partner.

Recently, Justin's fianc√©e expressed doubts about Kevin Trudeau's past, suggesting that it might be fabricated to attract followers, which led to a disagreement. Justin doesn't idolize Trudeau but finds his teachings very helpful.

Justin feels frustrated because their fianc√©e prioritizes activities like mobile games over self-improvement practices such as creating a dream board, reading together, or engaging in manifestation and journaling. While she initially seemed interested, attending a Kevin Trudeau fan club event and buying books, something recently caused her to question these teachings.

Refer to Justin with the pronoun 'he' and to his fianc√©e with the pronoun 'she.' Use the name Nina to refer to Justin's fianc√©e. Avoid using non-specific pronouns like 'they' or 'them.'

Justin has been engaged in self-healing practices, such as taking supplements and researching natural health alternatives, for at least 20 years.

Justin and Nina met during the end of a relationship that lasted 4 years. Justin was technically engaged to someone whom he lived with for 4 years, during which time she showed little to no interest in anything motivational, had no regard for disciplinary actions for her children, and did not follow up with any suggestions Justin made to her. She had no real life experience in socializing, and Justin often felt like his dreams did not coincide with hers.

At the end of that relationship, Justin explored the possibility of meeting someone new. This started as a discussion about making new friends but evolved into meeting new people as the relationship was dead, and Justin didn't want to leave her with nothing. She met several people, and one of them was Nina's former ex, whom she was still living with at the time. Nina had become polyamorous because her relationship was not fulfilling, and this was discussed with her partner, who agreed it was okay.

As Justin and Nina started talking more frequently, his relationship with his former partner quickly deteriorated because she became upset that Justin was falling for Nina, even though she had introduced them. The former partner, who had previously been allowed complete freedom in what she did, refused to allow Justin that same freedom. The relationship ended because Justin realized that the girl he had been with for 4 years was not the person he thought she was. She had cheated multiple times before polyamory, was manipulative, easily angered, narcissistic, and somewhat Machiavellian. Justin couldn't take her lack of respect, discipline for herself or her children, or self-growth, nor her lack of self-direction, while he had clear direction in his life.

**ASSISTANT**: Here‚Äôs a consolidated and more concise version of all your memories:

---

Justin believes much of history has been rewritten by secretive groups like the Freemasons to obscure advanced civilizations such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He thinks past cataclysms were orchestrated to erase these histories, with survivors placed in asylums, and that many world leaders are reused identities controlled by these groups. Justin believes advanced technologies like stargates were part of a global energy system that has been suppressed. He also entertains the idea that remnants of these civilizations exist in other dimensions or beneath the Earth. Events like the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccinations, and chemtrails are seen as part of broader efforts to suppress critical thinking and control humanity. He foresees a future cataclysm that could erase knowledge but thinks underground archives could preserve true history for future generations. He‚Äôs influenced by research from channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*.

Justin is currently focused on healing his own trauma and addressing unresolved issues that have impacted all of his relationships, including his current one with Nina. He recognizes that his healing needs to come first before he can help others, including his stepson Eli, who sees him as a father figure. Justin feels he took on too big a role in their lives, and it has taken a toll on his growth. He feels the need to leave to work on himself, despite still caring deeply for Nina and Eli.

Justin's interest in alternative health practices spans over 20 years, using methods like MMS and DMSO for healing. He also has strong interests in free energy and over-unity devices, although he cannot read blueprints.

Justin has experienced frustration with Nina's lack of interest in self-growth, as she often prioritizes mobile games over activities like creating a dream board, reading, or engaging in manifestation and journaling. He has felt disconnected from her due to their differing values in self-improvement. Although he has tried to encourage her, Nina remains skeptical about teachings Justin finds useful, like those of Kevin Trudeau.

Justin is drawn to libertarian values and desires to leave Michigan for places like New Hampshire. He feels constrained by the political environment in Michigan, and although his family is there, he ultimately plans to leave once his parents are no longer around. He feels he‚Äôs been on autopilot for years, living for others rather than himself, and feels it‚Äôs time to pursue his own goals in self-growth, business, and spiritual development.

This should cover the essential elements while streamlining everything. Let me know if you'd like any further changes before committing!

**USER**: Make sure the elements about relationships cover all the bases though, and that all bases are covered. Don't leave out things, but when broad topics are discussed, combine them using broad terminology to cover everything at once. Use language like "secretive groups" and "Secret Societies". 

When dealing with working on myself, make sure to commit the core essence of what I'm trying to do, and when Nina and Eli come up, make sure nothing is left out, and concisify it.

**ASSISTANT**: Here‚Äôs the revised version, ensuring all bases are covered and concise, while using broader terminology like ‚Äúsecretive groups‚Äù and capturing the essence of your personal journey and relationships:

Justin believes that much of history has been fabricated by secretive groups or secret societies, like the Freemasons, to hide advanced civilizations such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He thinks orchestrated cataclysms erased these civilizations, with survivors placed in asylums or orphanages to suppress their knowledge. He also believes that many world leaders are reused identities controlled by these groups. Justin thinks suppressed technologies, such as stargates and global energy systems, were once integral to these past civilizations. He believes remnants of these advanced societies exist in other dimensions or beneath the Earth's surface and that events like the COVID-19 pandemic, chemtrails, and vaccinations are part of broader efforts to control humanity and stifle critical thinking. He foresees a future cataclysm but believes underground archives could preserve the true history for future generations. He is influenced by research from channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*.

In his personal life, Justin is currently focused on deep self-healing and addressing long-standing trauma and issues that have affected all of his relationships, including his current one with Nina and his role as a father figure to Eli. He acknowledges that his own healing must take priority before he can fully help others, especially Eli, who views him as a father. Despite caring for both Nina and Eli, Justin recognizes that the emotional toll of this relationship has hindered his personal growth. He feels he took on more than he could handle emotionally and is now preparing to leave to focus on his own path.

Justin has often been a fixer in relationships, but he now recognizes that this has prevented him from focusing on his own needs. Nina‚Äôs lack of engagement in self-growth‚Äîdespite his efforts to introduce her to activities like manifestation, reading, and motivational seminars‚Äîhas contributed to his sense of disconnect. Although Nina initially showed some interest in figures like Kevin Trudeau, her skepticism about self-improvement teachings and preference for distractions like mobile games has widened the gap between them. 

Justin‚Äôs broader life goals include personal freedom, spiritual growth, self-realization, and building businesses. He no longer wants to stay in Michigan, a state he feels limits his values of liberty and autonomy, despite his family being there. While his love for his family is strong, he plans to leave once his parents pass, drawn to places with libertarian ideals like New Hampshire. He feels as though he‚Äôs spent years living for others and putting his life on hold, and now he seeks to finally pursue his own path.

In addition to his personal development, Justin has a long history of exploring alternative healing practices, having used MMS and DMSO for himself and others with significant success. He is deeply interested in free energy and over-unity devices but lacks the technical skill to interpret blueprints. Justin also aligns with beliefs like flat Earth theory and believes that more land exists beyond restricted zones.
