## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: IN Windows 11 is there a file search that IS NOT part of the start menu?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, in Windows 11, you can search for files using methods that are not part of the Start Menu. Here are a few options:

### 1. **File Explorer Search**
   - Open **File Explorer** (Win + E).
   - Navigate to the folder or drive where you want to search.
   - Use the search bar at the top-right corner of the File Explorer window to type your query. 
   - You can use advanced search operators to refine your search, such as `ext:.docx` for Word files or `size:>1MB` for files larger than 1MB.

---

### 2. **Windows Search in the Taskbar**
   - Click on the **Search** icon (magnifying glass) on the taskbar.
   - Type your query in the search box.
   - Filter results by selecting the "Documents," "Apps," "Web," or other categories listed at the top.

---

### 3. **Run Dialog**
   - Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
   - Type a search path, such as `C:\*.txt` to find all text files in the C: drive, or use wildcards for broader searches.

---

### 4. **PowerShell**
   - Open **PowerShell** and use the `Get-ChildItem` command to search for files:
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.txt
     ```
   - This method allows advanced filtering and scripting.

---

### 5. **Third-Party Tools**
   If you prefer even more powerful search capabilities, consider using third-party tools like:
   - **Everything**: An incredibly fast search utility for Windows.
   - **Listary**: Offers quick search and integration with many applications.
   - **UltraSearch**: Provides real-time results for file search.

Each method has its use case, so choose one depending on your needs!

**USER**: How do I search C:\ for PDFs that were created this year using Powershell?

**ASSISTANT**: To search for PDF files created in the current year (`2024`), you can use PowerShell with the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.pdf | Where-Object { $_.CreationTime.Year -eq (Get-Date).Year }
```

### Explanation of the Command:
1. **`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.pdf`**:
   - Lists all `.pdf` files in the `C:\` directory and its subdirectories.
   - The `-Recurse` flag ensures it searches through all subfolders.

2. **`Where-Object { $_.CreationTime.Year -eq (Get-Date).Year }`**:
   - Filters the results to include only files created in the current year.
   - `(Get-Date).Year` dynamically retrieves the current year (`2024`).

3. **Output**:
   - The command returns a list of PDF files with details like name, path, size, and creation date.

### Additional Notes:
- **Performance**: This command can be slow if you have a large number of files on `C:\`. Consider narrowing the search to a specific folder for better performance.
- **Customization**: If you want to save the results to a file, you can append `| Out-File C:\path\to\output.txt`.

For example:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.pdf | Where-Object { $_.CreationTime.Year -eq (Get-Date).Year } | Out-File C:\PDFResults.txt
```

This will save the output to `C:\PDFResults.txt`.

**USER**: Is there a shorter command to do that?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, here's a more concise command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.pdf | ? { $_.CreationTime.Year -eq (Get-Date).Year }
```

### Explanation:
1. **`?`**: Alias for `Where-Object`, used to make the command shorter.
2. **`$_`**: Represents the current object in the pipeline (each file in this case).
3. **`CreationTime.Year`**: Filters files based on their creation year.

This command achieves the same result but is shorter and easier to type.

**USER**: I want the year to be 2024

**ASSISTANT**: If you want to specifically filter for files created in 2024 (instead of dynamically using the current year), you can explicitly specify the year like this:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Filter *.pdf | ? { $_.CreationTime.Year -eq 2024 }
```

### Explanation:
- The condition `{ $_.CreationTime.Year -eq 2024 }` explicitly matches files created in the year 2024. 
- Everything else in the command remains the same, and it will search `C:\` recursively for PDF files created in 2024.
