**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are the lyrics for a song about Kevin Trudeau, the teachings of the Global Information Network, and incorporating the ideas of "The Strangest Secret" by Earl Nightingale:

---

**Verse 1:**

In a world where dreams are made,  
Kevin showed the way,  
With the Global Information Network,  
We're rising day by day.  

From the struggles and the shadows,  
To the light we finally see,  
We hold the power within us,  
To be who we want to be.  

**Chorus:**

We are what we think about,  
That's the strangest secret, no doubt,  
With every thought, we pave the way,  
To a brighter, better day.  

Kevin taught us to believe,  
In the dreams that we conceive,  
With the GIN, we find our way,  
To a life where dreams hold sway.  

**Verse 2:**

Success is no mystery,  
It's a path we choose to tread,  
With a burning desire,  
We forge ahead.  

Our minds are fertile gardens,  
Sow seeds of joy and might,  
With focus and persistence,  
We claim our birthright.  

**Chorus:**

We are what we think about,  
That's the strangest secret, no doubt,  
With every thought, we pave the way,  
To a brighter, better day.  

Kevin taught us to believe,  
In the dreams that we conceive,  
With the GIN, we find our way,  
To a life where dreams hold sway.  

**Bridge:**

So let’s cast away our fears,  
Embrace the life we choose,  
With Kevin’s wisdom guiding us,  
We’ve got nothing to lose.  

With every goal we set,  
And every dream we chase,  
We’ll find our place in the sun,  
In this wondrous, endless race.  

**Chorus:**

We are what we think about,  
That's the strangest secret, no doubt,  
With every thought, we pave the way,  
To a brighter, better day.  

Kevin taught us to believe,  
In the dreams that we conceive,  
With the GIN, we find our way,  
To a life where dreams hold sway.  

**Outro:**

So let’s raise our voices high,  
To the dreams that never die,  
With Kevin’s light and Nightingale’s truth,  
We’ll reach the endless sky.
