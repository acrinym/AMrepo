ðŸ”¥ CONTEXT FOR NEW CHAT â€“ AMANDA RELATIONSHIP BUILDER ðŸ”¥

The Journey So Far:

Justin & Amanda have a deep, undeniable connection.

Mike (Justinâ€™s best friend) actively set them up because he believes theyâ€™d be great together.

Amanda is aware of this setup but is taking her time processing it.

She keeps bringing up Justin to Mike, which means sheâ€™s thinking about him often.

Mike is stepping back to create space for Amanda & Justin to connect more.


Current Challenges:

Amanda is still letting go of her attachment to Mike.

Sheâ€™s cautious about relationships due to past trauma.

Sheâ€™s worried about stability & securityâ€”she keeps asking Justin where heâ€™s living.

She hasnâ€™t fully opened up to deeper feelings yet, but she hasnâ€™t rejected anything either.


Recent Developments:

Justin had a powerful lucid dream where Amanda appeared as an elusive Sasquatch, hiding behind a shed.

This represents her struggling to step forward while still hiding behind emotional walls.

Mike is planning to create more distance and suggested group hangouts at first before transitioning Amanda & Justin to 1-on-1 time.

A drinking game night at Mikeâ€™s house with Cards Against Humanity, Apples to Apples, or Quelf is planned to help Amanda loosen up and bond with Justin.

Justin is considering bringing hands-on activities like painting, drawing, or small DIY projects to create shared experiences.


Manifestation Work:

Justin is actively visualizing a life with Amanda through Quantum Jumping, LOA, and Transurfing techniques.

He listens to specific frequency tracks & does subconscious work daily.

A dream board is in the works, focusing on shared goals with Amanda.

"Cry to Your Soulmate" (Trigram Healing) has been used as part of the process.

A honey jar spell has already been done, and Justin is considering other energy-focused methods.


Key Goals Moving Forward:

Strengthen Amandaâ€™s emotional connection to Justin through shared experiences.

Continue visualization and manifestation techniques to align their realities.

Gradually shift Amandaâ€™s comfort level so she feels safe, secure, and ready to open up more.

Use the drinking game night as a way to create fun, laughter, and deeper connection in a casual, no-pressure setting.

Let Mike naturally transition out of the picture while still supporting the process.
