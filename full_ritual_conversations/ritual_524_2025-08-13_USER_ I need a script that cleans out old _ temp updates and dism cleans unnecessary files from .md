## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: I need a script that cleans out old / temp updates and dism cleans unnecessary files from win11. Discleanup via a script as well - the system options ( that leaves my files alone)

**USER**: Anything else that can be cleaned? I want as much space as possible.

**USER**: What about squirelltemp and Brave/opera temp updates (not cache)? 
Can we also clean temporarintertnetfolders(NOT CACHE FROM BRAVE/OPERA)

**ASSISTANT**: Below is an example of a batch script that:

- **Stops the Windows Update service** to allow deletion of temporary update files  
- **Clears the Windows Update download folder** and system temp folders  
- **Runs DISM to clean up the component store** (using both StartComponentCleanup and ResetBase, which removes superseded components)  
- (Optionally) **Runs Disk Cleanup** with a preset configuration

**Instructions:**

1. Copy the script into a text editor.
2. Save the file with a `.bat` extension (e.g., `CleanWin11.bat`).
3. Right-click the saved file and select “Run as administrator” (this is required for the DISM commands and service controls).

### Explanation

- **Service Control:**  
  The script stops the Windows Update service (`wuauserv`) before deleting files in the SoftwareDistribution folder, then restarts it afterward.

- **File Deletion:**  
  It clears the contents of:
  - `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download` – where Windows stores update downloads  
  - The user’s temporary folder (`%TEMP%`)  
  - The Windows Temp folder (`C:\Windows\Temp`)

- **DISM Cleanup:**  
  The `dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase` command cleans the Windows component store by removing outdated versions of system files while leaving your personal files intact. The `/Quiet` flag minimizes output and `/NoRestart` prevents an automatic restart.

- **Disk Cleanup (Optional):**  
  If you’ve previously set up Disk Cleanup with `cleanmgr /sageset:1`, you can uncomment the related lines to have it run as well.

Feel free to adjust the script based on your specific needs. This script is designed to free up disk space by cleaning system update files and unnecessary components while keeping your personal files safe.

**TOOL**: **Clarifying user request**

The user needs a script for Windows 11 to clean out old or temporary updates and use DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) to clean unnecessary files. Additionally, they want Disk Cleanup via a script, ensuring it doesn't affect their personal files. So, the goal is a script that automates these tasks without compromising files. I’ll focus on ensuring those system choices are respected. Let’s check what command sequences for DISM and cleanup can make this smooth.

**Sketching out the script process**

The user wants a script for cleaning Windows 11, targeting old update files and temp files without touching their personal data. For this, I'd likely use "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup" to clear outdated components without removing files. I should be cautious with "ResetBase" since it can limit rollback options. I could also incorporate "Cleanmgr" for automating Disk Cleanup and use the "del /q/f/s %TEMP%\*" command to clean temp files. Combining all these into a Windows Batch or PowerShell script should meet the user's needs.

**ASSISTANT**: Below is an enhanced batch script that goes beyond the basic cleanup. In addition to removing temporary Windows Update files, user temp folders, and running a DISM component cleanup, this script also:

- **Empties the Recycle Bin**  
- **Cleans the Prefetch folder** (which Windows will rebuild over time)  
- **Deletes Windows Error Reporting archives**  
- **Clears update-related logs and optional Delivery Optimization cache**  

> **⚠️ Caution:**  
> - Some of these deletions (like the Recycle Bin and Prefetch files) may temporarily impact system performance as Windows rebuilds caches.  
> - Always review and test in a controlled environment if you’re applying this on a production system.

### Script Overview

- **Windows Update and Delivery Optimization:**  
  Stops the Windows Update service before deleting the SoftwareDistribution download files. There’s also an optional section for deleting Delivery Optimization cache files (commented out by default).

- **Temporary Files and Cache:**  
  Deletes files in the user’s temporary folder, Windows Temp folder, and Prefetch folder. The Prefetch folder is automatically rebuilt by Windows, so this is safe if you need to free up space temporarily.

- **Error Reporting:**  
  Removes archived reports from the Windows Error Reporting folder, which can accumulate over time.

- **Recycle Bin:**  
  Empties the Recycle Bin to recover space from deleted files.

- **DISM Cleanup:**  
  Runs DISM with `/StartComponentCleanup` and `/ResetBase` to remove outdated system component versions.

- **Optional Disk Cleanup:**  
  Provides an option to run Disk Cleanup if you have preconfigured it via `cleanmgr /sageset:1`.

---

This enhanced script should help you reclaim even more disk space on your Windows 11 system. Feel free to adjust or uncomment additional sections as needed.

**TOOL**: **Considering additional cleanup options**

To maximize space on Windows 11, there are more cleaning steps to consider like running Disk Cleanup with different parameters (e.g., "cleanmgr /sageset:99"). We could also delete Windows update logs, conduct driver store cleanup, and clear the Windows event logs or recycle bin. Perhaps removing optional features could help too.

For more targeted cleanup, clearing specific temporary files or using DISM for WinSxS folder cleanup could help. Scripts like "del /f /s /q C:\Windows\Prefetch\*" or "del /f /s /q C:\$Recycle.Bin\*" are options, but with caution.

**Caution for thorough cleanup**

When we talk about cleaning things like the Recycle Bin, it’s possible to do it with the command "rd /s /q %systemdrive%\$Recycle.Bin," but that requires admin rights. Many temp folders are already covered by DISM, but there are user-dependent folders like Downloads that can be cleaned. Cleaning old system restore points is another option, but it’s risky if you need to restore.

I should mention tools like Storage Sense, but that's more of a setting than a script. Cleaning out logs and the "SoftwareDistribution" folder could be helpful, though these actions pose potential risks, especially if updates are pending.

**ASSISTANT**: Below is an enhanced version of the script that includes additional cleanups for:

- **SquirrelTemp Folder:** Often used by applications (like those using the Squirrel updater) for temporary update files.  
- **Brave and Opera Update Temp Folders:** (Not their caches) where temporary update files might reside.  
- **Temporary Internet Files:** Cleans the IE/Edge “INetCache” folder (ensuring it’s not touching browser caches from Brave/Opera).

> **⚠️ Caution:**  
> - Some directories (like Prefetch or update folders) will be rebuilt by Windows or the applications, so expect a short-term performance impact until they regenerate.  
> - Test the script in a safe environment before applying it on your main system.

### Breakdown of the New Sections

- **SquirrelTemp Folder:**  
  The script checks if `%LocalAppData%\SquirrelTemp` exists and deletes its contents. This folder is used by some applications for staging updates.

- **Brave & Opera Update Folders:**  
  It checks for the existence of `%LocalAppData%\BraveSoftware\Update` and `%LocalAppData%\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Update` and deletes their contents. This targets temporary update files—not the main cache—ensuring update-related leftovers are cleared.

- **Temporary Internet Files:**  
  Deletes files within `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache`, which is typically used for Internet Explorer and related components.

---

This script aims to free up as much space as possible by removing a variety of temporary files and update leftovers. Remember to run it as an administrator. Feel free to adjust or add further directories based on your system's configuration.

**TOOL**: **Considering temp folder cleanup**

The user is specifically asking about cleaning "SquirrelTemp" and the temporary update folders for Brave/Opera, without affecting the cache. "SquirrelTemp" is likely related to update files from applications using the Squirrel installer (like VS Code or Slack). Brave and Opera, being Chromium-based, also have temporary folders for updates (not cache). So, the request is to modify a script to include cleaning these temp update folders, excluding cache. Sounds doable!

**Clearing temporary update folders**

The user wants to clean "SquirrelTemp," browser update folders, and "Temporary Internet Files" (not cache) for Brave/Opera. SquirrelTemp is likely in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\SquirrelTemp, and cleaning could be done with a command like "del /f /s /q %LocalAppData%\SquirrelTemp\*". Brave and Opera use temporary folders for updates (but not caches). Opera update folder might be "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Update\*". For Brave, I think an update folder is in “BraveSoftware" in either ProgramData or a local folder—this needs confirmation by checking folder structure.

**Formulating cleanup script**

The user wants a script to clean certain temporary update files without affecting browser cache. Specific folders to check and clean include:

- SquirrelTemp: `%LocalAppData%\SquirrelTemp`
- Brave update temp files: `%LocalAppData%\BraveSoftware\Update`
- Opera update temp files: `%LocalAppData%\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Update`
- Temporary Internet Files for IE: `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache`

I’ll write a script that checks for these directories and deletes their contents while avoiding caches or interfering with the update processes. I’ll be cautious to handle these locations correctly.

**USER**: Now a seperate win11 script to clean any already installed updates. \

**USER**: Can't you technically revert to an earlier version of win11 by downloading necessary winupdate files and downgrade windows? It's a technical process, but one that testers have access to.

**ASSISTANT**: Below is a standalone batch script that focuses on cleaning out residual files from already installed updates. This script will:

- **Stop the Windows Update service** to safely remove update files  
- **Delete the contents of the Windows Update download folder**, which might contain leftover update files  
- **Run DISM with the /ResetBase option** to remove superseded update components from the component store

> **⚠️ Note:**  
> - Running DISM with /ResetBase permanently removes backup files for installed updates. This means you won't be able to uninstall them later.  
> - Ensure you have a recent backup or are comfortable with this change before running the script.

### How the Script Works

- **Service Control:**  
  - The script stops the Windows Update service (`wuauserv`) to ensure no files are locked.  
  - It then deletes any leftover update files from the `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download` folder and restarts the service.

- **DISM Cleanup:**  
  - The `dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase` command cleans the component store by removing outdated update components that are no longer needed.

Run this script as an administrator to ensure it has the proper permissions. This will help free up disk space by removing unnecessary files related to installed updates.

**TOOL**: **Clearing Windows update backups**

It seems the user is asking for a script to clean up previously installed updates in Windows 10/11. There's a DISM command, "dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup," which removes superseded updates. However, the previous script used "dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase" — so that’s already part of the solution. What’s likely needed is clearing out the update cache or removing the backup files that allow uninstallation of updates. I want to make sure I’m understanding correctly.

**Considering cleanup methods for updates**

Okay, so the user wants a script to clean installed updates—likely the backup components or update packages themselves. Using "dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase” makes sense, but that removes the ability to uninstall updates. I could also use “cleanmgr” for certain cleanups, like the Update Cleanup option. Stopping Windows Update service and removing backups from "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" is another way, though we've done that. It might just be about cleaning superseded updates, but I need to confirm what they want exactly.

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, technically it is possible—but it's a nuanced and advanced process. Here are some key points:

- **Rollback vs. Downgrade:**  
  - **Rollback:** Windows 11 includes a built-in rollback feature (typically within 10 days of upgrading) that allows you to revert to the previous version without downloading separate update files.  
  - **Downgrade:** Reverting to an earlier version beyond that period or to a different build often requires downloading the correct installation media or update packages.

- **Using Offline Packages:**  
  - You can download standalone update packages (from sources like the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx)) and, with tools like DISM, remove or replace existing components.  
  - This process involves manually managing Windows update packages, which is something testers or IT professionals might do in controlled environments.

- **Technical Complexity & Risks:**  
  - The process requires a solid understanding of Windows servicing tools, command-line utilities, and the overall Windows image structure.  
  - Once you use commands like `dism /ResetBase`, you remove backup files for updates, meaning you lose the ability to uninstall them later.  
  - Downgrading improperly can lead to system instability or data loss, so these methods are generally reserved for testing or recovery scenarios.

- **Practical Recommendations:**  
  - For most users, the official rollback within the recovery environment is the safest option.  
  - If you need to revert beyond the rollback window, a clean installation using an earlier Windows 11 ISO is usually the recommended approach.  
  - Testers and professionals often work in isolated environments to validate these methods before applying them to production systems.

In summary, while the technical capability exists to revert to an earlier version by downloading necessary update files and using advanced tools, it involves considerable complexity and risk. This is why it's typically only performed by testers or IT professionals under controlled conditions.

**TOOL**: **Explaining Windows downgrade**

Yes, you *can* technically revert to an earlier version of Windows 11, as long as you have the required installation media and update files. You'd need to download the necessary update packages, like those from the Microsoft Update Catalog, and then follow the rollback or downgrade process.

This is a technical task, often accessible to testers, and involves using specific tools and methods to reinstall or revert the OS to a previous version.

**Explaining the downgrade process**

Yes, technically, it's possible to revert to an earlier version of Windows 11, but the process is complex and not commonly recommended. You’d need the right update files, like those from the Microsoft Update Catalog, and use tools like DISM or WIM. Testers or IT professionals might have additional tools, like a rollback feature within a limited time (usually 10 days). After that, a clean install may be needed, and doing it improperly can risk stability or data loss.

**USER**: Next, I would like to know if there's an ADB script that will delete any residual updates for Android. It keeps wanting to update to Android 15 but I'm not ready for that because the last Android really sucked. Android 13 sucked, no I'm on 14 and don't really want to update to 15.

**ASSISTANT**: Below is an ADB (Android Debug Bridge) script example that attempts to remove residual update files which might be prompting your device to update to Android 15. **Important:**  
- **Root Required:** Most of these commands require root access. If your device isn’t rooted (or doesn’t allow adb root), these commands might fail or be inaccessible.  
- **OEM Variations:** Update file locations can vary between manufacturers. The paths provided here are common locations (e.g., for OTA packages), but they might need adjustment for your specific device.  
- **Future Updates:** Removing update packages may block your ability to revert or reinstall a previous update. Use these commands only if you are sure you don’t want to move to Android 15.

---

### ADB Script Example

You can save the following commands in a shell script (for Linux/Mac) or a batch file (for Windows) and execute it with ADB. Adjust paths as necessary for your device.

```batch
@echo off
REM ================================================
REM ADB Script to Remove Residual Android Update Files
REM ================================================
REM This script attempts to delete residual OTA update files to avoid auto-updates.
REM NOTE: This script typically requires a rooted device.

echo Attempting to restart ADB as root...
adb root

REM Remount the system partition as read-write if applicable.
adb remount

echo Deleting potential update package from recovery cache...
adb shell "rm -f /cache/recovery/update.zip"

echo Deleting OTA package folder (if present)...
adb shell "rm -rf /data/system/ota_package"

REM Optional: Attempt to disable the system updater app.
REM The package name may differ based on OEM; use "adb shell pm list packages | findstr /i updater"
REM For example, if the updater package is com.android.updater, uncomment the following line:
REM adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.updater

echo Cleanup commands executed. Please check your device.
pause
```

---

### Explanation

- **adb root & adb remount:**  
  - These commands attempt to switch ADB to root mode and remount system partitions as read-write. This is usually required to delete system update files.  
  - If your device doesn’t support adb root (common on non-rooted devices), these commands may fail.

- **Deleting Update Files:**  
  - The command `adb shell "rm -f /cache/recovery/update.zip"` removes a common OTA package stored in the recovery partition.  
  - The command `adb shell "rm -rf /data/system/ota_package"` targets another common directory where residual OTA files might reside.

- **Disabling the Updater (Optional):**  
  - Some devices use a dedicated updater app that triggers the update process. If you identify the package name (by listing packages, e.g., `adb shell pm list packages | findstr /i updater`), you can disable it using the provided command.  
  - **Warning:** Disabling system updater components might prevent legitimate future updates or leave your device vulnerable if security patches are delayed.

---

### Final Notes

- **Test First:** Run each command individually in an ADB shell to verify that they work on your device before bundling them into a script.
- **Backup:** Always back up your data before making system modifications.
- **OEM Differences:** If the residual update files are stored elsewhere on your device, adjust the paths accordingly.

This script should serve as a starting point for preventing the automatic prompt to update to Android 15. Adapt it to your device’s specifics and proceed with caution.

**TOOL**: **Crafting ADB solution**

The user is asking about an ADB script to remove residual updates preventing their device from updating to Android 15. They’re on Android 14 and want to avoid Android 15 because they didn’t like the previous version. To craft a solution, I need to consider the method to delete these updates—not just the update files—but residual data that might trigger the automatic update to Android 15. I’ll need to ensure that the script is specific and addresses the update mechanism.

**Addressing Android update issues**

The user doesn't want to update from Android 14 to 15, and I need to create an ADB script to remove residual updates. Residual updates could mean leftover temporary update files or perhaps cache files, stored in partitions like /cache, /data, or even the /sdcard/Download folder. However, some of these actions may require root access, which not all devices have. To proceed, I'll suggest clearing common update directories and disabling update services, with the reminder that root might be needed for some.

**Crafting ADB script for updates**

The user wants ADB instructions to remove residual update files and prevent the update to Android 15. I can include commands to delete common update files stored in directories like /cache/recovery and /data/system/ota_package. If the device is rooted, I can add commands like "adb root" and "adb remount." Additionally, I’ll provide an option to disable update notifications by disabling the update app package, though this might differ by device. I'll add a caution about potential security risks.

**USER**: Is there a way to prevent Android 15 without root

**ASSISTANT**: There are a few methods you might try without rooting your device, but note that these approaches aren’t guaranteed on every device and can sometimes have side effects:

### 1. Disable Automatic Downloads in Settings  
- **Check for Update Settings:**  
  Some manufacturers include an option in the Software Update settings (often under Advanced settings) that lets you disable or delay automatic downloads of updates. This is the safest way to postpone an unwanted update.  
- **Limit Notifications:**  
  Even if you can’t stop the download completely, you may be able to disable update notifications.

### 2. Use ADB to Disable the System Updater  
- **ADB Commands (Without Root):**  
  In many cases, you can use ADB (with your computer connected) to disable the system updater app. For example, try running this command (replace the package name if necessary for your device):

  ```batch
  adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.systemupdater
  ```

  - **Note:**  
    - The package name can vary by manufacturer (e.g., it might be `com.android.systemupdate` or similar).  
    - This method may work on some devices without root but might be reversed on a reboot or update.

### 3. Network Restrictions  
- **Block Update Domains:**  
  Although not foolproof, you can try setting up network rules (using a firewall or at your router) to block domains known to serve update files. However, updates often use multiple servers, so this method can be hit or miss.

### Considerations  
- **Security Risks:**  
  Preventing system updates can leave your device vulnerable to security issues. Make sure you understand the risks before disabling updates entirely.  
- **Reversibility:**  
  Some changes may be temporary. For example, disabling the updater with ADB might revert after a system restart or future update.  
- **Manufacturer Variability:**  
  Since Android update mechanisms differ among OEMs, these methods might work on some devices but not others.

In summary, while there are non-root workarounds like adjusting settings, using ADB commands to disable the updater, or restricting network access, none offer a foolproof, long-term solution to block Android 15 on every device. Always weigh the benefits against the risks of missing critical security updates.

**TOOL**: **Considering Android 15 prevention**

The user wants to avoid updating to Android 15 without rooting their device. Since update mechanisms are typically system-level and often require root to disable, this is tricky. However, I can suggest some alternatives. Disabling auto-update in system settings could be an option if it's available. Additionally, ADB commands might help to disable the system updater, if the device allows that without root. I'll focus on these methods that are more user-accessible.

**Exploring Android update prevention**

Without root, ADB commands are limited, and disabling system updates is often not an option. However, there are workarounds. For some devices, you can turn off auto-updates in Developer Options, but it may not work if updates are pushed at a system level. You could also try blocking update notifications using a restricted work profile, though that’s not guaranteed. Generally, disabling system updates without root is hard, but ADB might help disable some services, like user apps. Still, system-level apps are tricky without root.

**USER**: I can also use that ADB type hack that uses system level access through Android itself without going back to ADB shell, there's tahaka which will allow certain system level accesses without having a root

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you're on the right track. Some tools let you leverage ADB-level permissions without needing full root access. Here are some key points:

- **ADB-Based Privilege Escalation:**  
  - Tools like **Shizuku** (and similar projects) use ADB to grant apps system-level access. This lets you perform actions—such as disabling system updater apps or removing update files—that would otherwise require root.  
  - If you're referring to something like "Tahaka," it likely works on the same principle: connecting via ADB to gain elevated privileges without modifying the device’s underlying security (beyond what's permitted by ADB).

- **What You Can Do:**  
  - With these privileges, you could disable or block the system updater, remove or move OTA packages, or adjust update-related settings—all without having to fully root your device.  
  - This approach can help delay or prevent the prompt to update to Android 15 if the updater app or its residual files are the trigger.

- **Limitations and Considerations:**  
  - **Temporary Access:** These methods usually work until a reboot or a system update, as the elevated permissions can be revoked.  
  - **Manufacturer Variability:** The exact package names or update paths can differ between OEMs, so you might need to adjust commands for your specific device.  
  - **Security and Stability:** Modifying system-level components (even via ADB) may lead to unintended side effects, so it’s wise to back up your data and test any changes carefully.
  - **No Official Support:** While these hacks can be useful, they're not officially supported by Android or device manufacturers, which means future updates might bypass or disable such methods.

In short, using an ADB hack (like the one you mentioned with Tahaka) can be a viable way to prevent the Android 15 update on your device without rooting, but it's best suited for advanced users who understand the risks and potential limitations.

**TOOL**: **Looking into Tahaka**

Okay, the user's talking about a possible ADB hack using system-level access through Android, and mentions "Tahaka." I'm not quite sure about "Tahaka," though—maybe it’s a tool or method I'm unfamiliar with? No root access, yet system-level access, sounds intriguing. I'll have to double-check if "Tahaka" refers to a well-known technique or software. Hmm... Let me quickly clarify. I'll also want to ensure everything’s explained clearly here if the user’s asking for more details.

**Clarifying the ADB hack**

The user mentions an "ADB-type hack" for system-level access, bringing up "Tahaka." I’m not entirely sure if "Tahaka" is a tool I’m familiar with, but it might be a reference to apps like "Shizuku" or "Tasker" which allow system-level access without root, making it easier to run ADB commands. "Shizuku" specifically uses ADB in a way that doesn’t require root access. Let me double-check, but I think the user might actually be referring to Shizuku.

**Explaining ADB-based tools**

The user mentioned "Tahaka," which might be a tool for system-level access via ADB without root. I think this could refer to "Shizuku" or perhaps "tAHAKA," which both use ADB to give apps elevated privileges. Since these tools allow system-level changes, you could potentially disable the Android system's update services or delete update files. However, such methods depend on your device and security settings, and changes might not persist after a reboot. Remember, this method is tricky and not officially supported. Using it might also risk unexpected behavior.

**USER**: Shizuku yeah

**ASSISTANT**: Shizuku is exactly the kind of tool that can help you gain system-level access without requiring full root privileges. Here’s how it works and what you can do with it:

- **How Shizuku Works:**  
  - **ADB Bridge:** Shizuku leverages an ADB connection to allow apps to access system-level APIs that typically require root.  
  - **Permission Management:** Once Shizuku is running (via a one-time ADB command to start its service), it lets you grant elevated privileges to specific apps without permanently modifying your device’s security model.

- **What You Can Do With Shizuku:**  
  - **Disable or Modify the System Updater:** With the necessary privileges, you can disable the system updater app (for example, using an ADB command or a third-party app that supports Shizuku) to block the prompt or auto-download of the Android 15 update.  
  - **Manage Residual Update Files:** You can potentially clear or modify directories containing update files if they’re causing unwanted update prompts, similar to the ADB script approach but with the added ease that Shizuku provides.
  - **System Tweaks:** Beyond updates, Shizuku can help with other system modifications that usually require root, giving you more control over your device.

- **Steps to Get Started:**  
  1. **Install Shizuku:** Download the Shizuku app from the Google Play Store or its official source.  
  2. **Enable the Service:** Follow the on-screen instructions—this typically involves running a one-time ADB command to start the Shizuku service.  
  3. **Grant Permissions:** Once active, any supported app can request system-level permissions via Shizuku. Look for apps or scripts designed to work with Shizuku for disabling update services or cleaning update files.

- **Considerations:**  
  - **Temporary Access:** The elevated privileges granted by Shizuku might be reset after a reboot or system update, so you might need to re-enable them periodically.  
  - **OEM Specifics:** Different devices may have different package names or file paths for system updaters, so you may have to adjust commands based on your device.  
  - **Security & Stability:** While Shizuku provides a less invasive way to access system features, modifying system behavior can have side effects. Always back up your data before making changes.

In summary, Shizuku offers a viable, non-root method to achieve system-level access for tasks like preventing unwanted updates. It’s a powerful tool if you’re looking to fine-tune your device’s behavior without the complications of full rooting.

**TOOL**: **Explaining Shizuku**

So, Shizuku is a tool that allows system-level access to apps without requiring root, but it uses ADB. It essentially grants apps permissions that are usually reserved for system-level processes.

To use Shizuku:
- Install the app and set it up via ADB.
- Then, grant system-level privileges to apps.
- You can then disable the system updater or block future updates by modifying system settings or managing permissions.

Just be cautious though, because tweaking system-level settings might interfere with your phone’s proper functioning.

**Explaining Shizuku**

Yes, Shizuku allows you to do that. It lets you use system-level permissions without rooting by using ADB. Here's how it works:

- **What Shizuku is**: ADB-based tool granting system-level permissions.
- **How to install**: Run the Shizuku app, enable via ADB.
- **What you can do**: Grant system privileges to apps to modify system settings like disabling the updater.
- **Limitations**: Ensure compatibility since not all devices support it.
- **Summary**: Shizuku helps you manage system settings without root access.

**USER**: Is there an Android app that I can install from the play store that sets up shizuku and allows me to pick which system components etc I disable

**ASSISTANT**: While Shizuku itself is available on the Play Store and is the key to granting system-level permissions without full root, there isn’t a single, one‑stop app that offers a complete graphical interface to pick and disable every system component. Instead, Shizuku acts as a bridge for other apps to perform tasks that normally require root access.

Here are some options and workarounds:

- **Shizuku (The Service):**  
  - Install the official Shizuku app from the Play Store. It will guide you through a one‑time setup (using ADB) that lets you grant system-level permissions to other apps.  
  - Once set up, Shizuku doesn’t inherently provide a UI for disabling system components—it just enables other apps to use its elevated permissions.

- **Third‑Party Apps That Leverage Shizuku:**  
  - Some apps are designed to disable or manage system packages and services without root by integrating with Shizuku. For example, certain package disablers or system management tools (often discussed in forums like XDA Developers) let you disable system updater apps or other components by invoking commands such as:  
    ```bash
    pm disable-user --user 0 <package.name>
    ```  
  - The availability and effectiveness of these apps can vary by device and manufacturer. For instance, apps like “Package Disabler Pro” (often available for specific OEMs like Samsung) sometimes offer non‑root methods via Shizuku, but a universal solution for all Android devices isn’t common.

- **DIY Approach Using a Terminal Emulator:**  
  - If you’re comfortable with command‑line work, you can install a terminal emulator that supports Shizuku’s elevated permissions (once Shizuku is running). This way, you can manually disable components by running ADB‑like commands directly on your device.  
  - For example, to disable the system updater, you might run:  
    ```bash
    pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.systemupdater
    ```  
    (Be sure to confirm the correct package name for your device.)

- **Community Recommendations:**  
  - Many users looking to prevent unwanted updates or disable system components share their experiences on forums like XDA Developers. There, you might find recommendations for specific apps or tools that work with Shizuku for your particular device model.

**In Summary:**  
While there isn’t a single Play Store app that bundles all these features into one neat package, you can set up Shizuku and then use various third‑party apps or terminal commands to selectively disable system components. This approach offers flexibility but may require a bit of experimentation and careful research for your specific device and needs.

Always proceed with caution—altering system components can affect device stability or security, so it’s wise to back up your data before making changes.

**TOOL**: **Exploring Android apps for Shizuku**

There’s an app called Shizuku, which provides access to system APIs via ADB, and it works with "Shizuku Manager"—though I’m not totally sure about that combination. Some apps use Shizuku, like "Naptime" or "AutoRemote," but they don’t exactly let you disable specific system components. "System App Remover" does allow some customization, but it needs root access. "O&O ShutUp10" is similar but for Windows 10, not Android. This seems to be a bit tricky!

**Exploring Shizuku-based apps for system control**

The user is asking for a way to disable system apps without root, using Shizuku. There's an app called "Shizuku" available on the Play Store by Rikka, offering system API access. I remember that "SystemBridge" might also provide an interface, but I’m not sure. Apps like "Activity Launcher" and "App Ops - Permission Manager" use Shizuku, but I’m not sure if they let you disable system components. "Nekit" seems to allow disabling certain components, and "Universal System Tuner" might also offer tuning with Shizuku. Still, no universal UI for all system apps.

**Shizuku and system component management**

There isn’t a dedicated app for disabling all system components using Shizuku, but some apps leverage Shizuku's capabilities. "Shizuku" itself provides elevated privileges and can be used with third-party apps like "Disable Service Manager," "Naptime," or even "System App Remover." However, some apps, like "System App Remover," may require root, which complicates things. "Package Disabler Pro," specific to Samsung, can disable system packages, but this might vary by device. It seems like you might need to experiment with different tools!

**USER**: Is there a script that's already built for Pixel 7 AT&t variety, pixel 7 pro specifically that may be an XDA or managing system packages where I can pick what I want

**ASSISTANT**: Below is an example of a Windows batch script inspired by various XDA threads that lets you interactively list, disable, and re‑enable system packages on a Pixel 7 Pro (AT&T variant) using ADB. This isn’t an “official” one‑click tool from XDA, but many community members have shared similar scripts that let you choose what to disable. You may need to adjust package names or add extra functionality for your specific needs.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> • Be sure to enable USB debugging on your device and have ADB installed on your PC.  
> • Disabling system packages can affect functionality or future updates.  
> • Test carefully and back up your device before making changes.

### Community Resources

Many XDA threads and community guides have discussed similar scripts for Pixel devices. If you’re looking for a more polished tool or additional functionality (such as an interactive graphical interface or integration with Shizuku), you might explore:  

- **XDA Developers Forums:** Search for “Pixel 7 de-bloat” or “Pixel 7 package manager” for user‑submitted scripts and tips.  
- **Third‑Party Tools:** Some apps (like “ADB AppControl” on PC or “Package Disabler Pro” for some OEMs) can offer GUI-based management without full root.

This script is a starting point. Modify and expand it as needed to suit your specific requirements on your Pixel 7 Pro (AT&T). Enjoy customizing your device!

**TOOL**: **Checking for scripts**  
The user is asking if there's a specific script for managing the Pixel 7 Pro AT&T variant, especially from XDA, to help with system packages. Sounds like they want something to handle bloatware or system updates. From what I remember, there are threads on XDA that include scripts for the Pixel 7 series to disable bloatware or even update packages. It'd be a good idea to check those specific XDA guides for details about what can be done for the Pixel 7 Pro.

**Exploring possible scripts**  
The user is looking for a script specific to the Pixel 7 Pro AT&T, especially one that manages system packages or bloatware. While I can’t browse the web directly, I remember that there are XDA threads talking about scripts for the Pixel 7 series. Specifically, I think there’s a script using ADB commands or Shizuku integration to disable unwanted system apps. The "Pixel 7 De-Bloat Script" is one that comes to mind, though I can't guarantee its compatibility.

**Explaining de-bloating scripts**  
There’s a script called "Pixel 7 De-Bloat" on XDA that helps disable unwanted system apps using ADB. I can provide an example of how such a script might look—here’s one for listing and disabling apps:

```
@echo off
echo Pixel 7 Pro Package Manager
echo.
echo Listing system packages...
adb shell pm list packages -s
echo.
echo Enter the package you wish to disable:
set /p packageName="Package: "
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 %packageName%
echo Disabled package.
pause
```

However, I can’t guarantee compatibility with the AT&T variant, so double-check before using it.

**ASSISTANT**: I haven’t found a “one‐click, Pixel 7 AT&T–specific” script on XDA that lets you pick exactly which system packages to disable. However, there are a few popular tools and threads that might be exactly what you’re looking for:

- **Universal Debloat Tools:**  
  – Projects like [0x192/universal-android-debloater](citeturn1search5) (a cross‑platform GUI written in Rust) work on most Android devices—even non‑rooted ones. They let you select from preset lists (or even customize your own) and disable or “uninstall” (for user 0) system packages.

- **ADB AppControl:**  
  – This is a well‑known Windows tool that, when used in conjunction with Shizuku (for system‑level access without root), presents a GUI to list and manage installed apps. It’s very popular on XDA for debloating Pixel devices and can be configured to your liking.

- **XDA Threads Specific to Pixel Debloating:**  
  – For example, there’s a thread titled “Google Pixel 7 Debloat ultra list + ADB command optimize” by anhquan23031 (citeturn1search0) that provides a text file (like Final14.txt) with a list of apps to remove via ADB commands. Although it isn’t built exclusively for the AT&T variant, the Pixel 7 Pro systems are very similar across carriers so it should work well.

In summary, while there isn’t a script built exclusively for the AT&T Pixel 7 Pro that lets you “pick and choose” in one neat package, these tools are flexible enough to be adapted for your needs. You might want to try Universal Android Debloater or ADB AppControl, and check out XDA threads for additional custom lists and tweaks.

Would you like a short summary or links to these projects?

**TOOL**: **Searching for debloat script**

The user is looking for a script specifically for the Pixel 7 Pro AT&T that can manage system packages, especially to disable bloatware interactively. I saw a GitHub project called "universal-android-debloater" that's cross-platform, but it doesn't specify the Pixel 7 AT&T. There's also a thread on XDA for a "Google Pixel 7 Debloat ultra list + ADB command optimize," but it’s not interactive. I’ll keep searching for more specific solutions for that model.

**Considering debloat options**

It seems like there isn't a script specifically for Pixel 7 Pro AT&T, but there are universal debloat tools that might work, like 0x192's "universal-android-debloater" on GitHub. ADB AppControl is another option that lists installed packages with a GUI for disabling them and works with Shizuku. I found a thread on XDA called "Google Pixel 7 Debloat ultra list + ADB command optimize" that might help, though it’s not AT&T-specific. It could still work for your Pixel 7 Pro!

**USER**: What about something that will remove all windows 11 extra languages, keyboard layouts, muis, guis etc, and allow me to process them manually

**ASSISTANT**: For Windows 11 you can “debloat” the installation by removing extra language packs, keyboard layouts, MUI (Multilingual User Interface) files, and other unused components—giving you more control over what stays on your system. While there isn’t a single “one‑click” tool that does exactly this (and then lets you manually review what’s been removed), there are several approaches and tools you can use:

- **Using DISM Commands:**  
  Windows’ own Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool lets you list and remove installed packages (such as language packs and MUI files). For example, you can list all language packages with:  
  ```
  dism /online /Get-Packages | findstr /i "language"
  ```  
  And then remove an unwanted package with:  
  ```
  dism /online /Remove-Package /PackageName:<PackageName>
  ```  
  (Be sure to back up your system or create a restore point first.)

- **Windows10Debloater / Windows11Debloater Scripts:**  
  Several community‑developed debloater scripts (such as [Windows10Debloater by Sycnex](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater)) have been updated by the community to work on Windows 11. These scripts let you disable or remove unwanted apps and packages (including extra language resources) using a menu‑driven interface. Although they’re not exclusively built to remove *only* extra languages and MUI files, you can customize the lists manually.

- **NTLite:**  
  If you want to process the removal manually (for example, when building a custom Windows image), [NTLite](https://www.ntlite.com/) is a third‑party tool that lets you load a Windows 11 ISO and strip out unwanted components—including language packs, keyboard layouts, and other system features—before installing the OS. It gives you fine‑grained control over what is included in your installation image.

Each of these approaches gives you the ability to remove components you don’t need and then process or re‑install what you prefer later. Just keep in mind that removing system packages can affect update behavior and system stability, so it’s always a good idea to back up your data or create a system restore point first.

Would you like more details on any of these methods?

**TOOL**: **Considering language and bloat removal tools**

The user is asking about removing extra languages, keyboard layouts, and other system files from Windows 11. It seems like they want to streamline the OS, likely to save disk space. There are tools for this, like DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), which can remove unused language packs. Additionally, scripts like "Windows10Debloater" also clean out bloat from Windows 10/11. These tools give users a way to manually manage and reduce unnecessary extras in the system.

**Exploring language and component removal**

The user wants a way to remove extra language resources, keyboard layouts, MUI files, and other components from Windows 11, to be processed manually. There are several ways to do this. Tools like DISM can remove language packs with a command like "dism /online /remove-package /packagename." You can also use scripts like "Windows10Debloater" or "NTLite," which remove bloat and unnecessary features like languages and preinstalled apps. If the user wants a sample script, I can provide one using DISM commands.
