Congratulations! You've successfully created an ammo-box rocket stove. Enjoy cooking with your efficient and DIY outdoor stove!

**USER**: Can you now tell me how to make a rocket stove out of a cardboard box?

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Creating a rocket stove out of a cardboard box is a temporary and simple solution, suitable for light use or as a makeshift stove in emergency situations. Keep in mind that this is not a long-term solution, as cardboard is not a heat-resistant material. Always prioritize safety, and never leave the stove unattended. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Materials/Parts List:**

1. **Cardboard Box:** Choose a sturdy cardboard box of a suitable size for your intended use. It should be large enough to accommodate your cooking pots but not so large that it becomes unstable.

2. **Aluminum Foil:** To line the inside of the box and protect it from direct contact with flames.

3. **Steel or Aluminum Cans:** Two cans of different sizes will be used to create the combustion chamber and chimney.

4. **Grate or Wire Mesh:** To create a platform for the fuel inside the combustion chamber.

5. **Insulating Material:** If available, use insulating materials such as vermiculite or sand to surround the combustion chamber, enhancing efficiency and safety.

6. **Tin Snips or Scissors:** To cut the cans.

7. **Utility Knife or Box Cutter:** For cutting openings in the cardboard.

8. **Tape or Glue:** To secure the aluminum foil and assemble the stove.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Safety First:**
   - Ensure good ventilation in your workspace.
