**Host:** Let's start with one of the most transformative moments in modern history—the attacks on September 11, 2001. On this day, coordinated terrorist attacks were carried out by the extremist group Al-Qaeda, targeting the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Nearly three thousand people lost their lives. This event profoundly affected global politics, security policies, and international relations.

The project opened new doors in medical research and biotechnology, paving the way for advances in personalized medicine.
