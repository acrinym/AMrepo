Justin shared that his love for affection and giving attention has often taken up too much of his time in past relationships, time that he feels could have been better spent learning and taking actions to achieve his goals. He feels that much of the time spent with women has been unproductive.

When he first met Nina, they shared poems and songs, and she shared her college research papers with him, which led him to believe she was more of a creative person with a love for learning. However, over time, Justin realized that Nina’s love for learning diminished, and she has mostly stuck to subjects she already knows. Though she has made attempts to learn with him, Justin noticed that she often avoided watching documentaries he felt were important, and when they did watch them together, she would frequently fall asleep.

Justin feels that Nina makes a good friend but not an ideal lover or partner, as he doesn't believe she has a strong understanding of how to navigate a relationship.

Justin believes that events like the COVID-19 pandemic and other mainstream narratives are false flags designed to steer the general public in a certain way. He sees these narratives as being similar to how Marxism was designed to control the thinking of populations under communist regimes, leading to a uniformity of thought.

Justin believes that many major events throughout history, including school shootings, Pearl Harbor, the Boston Marathon bombing, and 9/11, among others, are in the majority of cases false flags. He feels that these events have been deliberately designed to steer the public narrative in a particular direction, similar to how Marxism was used to control public thought in communist regimes. He sees these events as part of a broader effort to manipulate societal beliefs and maintain control over the population.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 narrative, including slogans like 'we're all in this together' and 'you're not just protecting yourself, but everyone,' mirrors the way propaganda is spread in regimes like North Korea. He feels that these messages, similar to how the North Korean government controls its population through uniform media, are used to foster compliance and conformity. He likens the public's reaction to such narratives to an army of disheartened individuals, all consuming the same messages without questioning their validity.

Justin believes that during the Obama administration, the law preventing the government from using propaganda in the United States was overturned, allowing the government to spread propaganda freely. He feels that this has led to widespread use of propaganda across various media platforms, particularly with regard to COVID-19, pharmaceuticals, and diseases. Justin believes that the government has been using these methods to manipulate public perception and behavior, with pharmaceutical ads and media messages reinforcing control over the population.

Justin dislikes women who spend a large amount of time focused on self-vanity, such as looking through fashion magazines or having a large collection of makeup. He believes that excessive attention to vanity suggests a lack of confidence in their natural beauty. For Justin, it's a bonus if a woman recognizes her own beauty because many have been degraded by societal pressures, particularly the influence of men and the broader culture, to conform to an unrealistic standard of beauty, like that portrayed by figures such as Barbie. He views vanity as a disgrace and believes that societal propaganda, like the Barbie narrative, contributes to this unhealthy obsession with appearance. However, Justin clarified that he does not inherently dislike self-confident women, particularly those who own businesses or hold positions of power. He is turned off by women who spend excessive amounts of time on self-vanity, such as spending hours in front of a mirror, frequently shopping for new fashion items, or browsing fashion magazines. Justin finds excessive face decorations, such as multiple earrings or gauged ears, and excessive body decorations, like tattoos, to be a major turnoff. He believes that before a partner becomes wealthy, they should not focus excessively on vanity, as it detracts from personal substance.

Justin finds a woman who is knowledgeable about history, especially alternative history, incredibly attractive. A woman who can hold a conversation about topics like free energy and is eager to learn more about subjects he’s interested in, such as alternative history, really captivates him. He hasn't had a partner deeply engaged in the same interests before, and although he has shared activities like watching movies, going on walks, and gardening with women, his research and exploration of these topics have not been undertaken with a partner.

Justin finds nerdy girls to be a plus, particularly those who can hold a conversation on a wide range of topics and possess a deeper level of learning that goes beyond surface-level understanding. He values a woman who is passionate about self-growth and eager to learn more, even if she excels in only one subject, as long as she is willing to expand her knowledge. However, if a woman is only knowledgeable in one subject and has no desire to learn beyond it, Justin feels she isn’t worth his time.

Justin mentioned that many of the qualities he values in a partner, such as intellectual curiosity and a passion for self-growth, are also essential in friendships. He plans to create a separate friend profile later to reflect the qualities he desires in friendships, though it will differ from his relationship profile by toning down the romantic aspects.

Justin is interested in conspiracy theories and believes that many mainstream narratives are deliberately manipulated to serve hidden agendas. He sees value in questioning official stories and exploring alternative perspectives, particularly when it comes to history, government actions, and global events. His focus on uncovering deeper truths drives his interest in conspiracy theories, and he often connects these beliefs to his broader understanding of how societies are controlled and influenced.

Justin believes that the term 'conspiracy theory' was coined by the CIA during the JFK situation, and that its purpose was to discredit those questioning official narratives. Although attempts have been made to debunk this origin, Justin maintains that the term was used to steer public perception and discredit alternative viewpoints.

Justin believes that Flat Earth is not a theory but an alternative view that represents the truth. He thinks that the globe model was created approximately 500 years ago by figures like Copernicus to discredit the truth of the Flat Earth, which has been known by civilizations since the beginning of time. Justin believes that this is documented in various books and archaic writings.

Justin has looked into many different scientific experiments and research that he believes prove a Flat Earth. He references experiments like the Michelson-Morley experiment as examples of real-life evidence supporting the Flat Earth view.

Justin believes that there are numerous experiments and real-life observations that disprove the globe Earth model and provide evidence for a Flat Earth. He references the Bedford Level Experiment, laser level tests, and modern photography experiments where no curvature is seen, even at distances where it should be evident if the Earth were a globe. He believes that mainstream explanations involving lens distortion are incorrect.

Justin holds that the globe Earth model is a fallacy, while the Flat Earth is only a small part of the reality. He believes that the Moon is a literal map, with its dark spots representing water and its light spots representing land, including areas not shown on traditional maps. He asserts that there are extended lands beyond what is currently accessible, past Antarctica and the Arctic Circle, which have been referenced in numerous books.

Justin believes that the Iron Republic story, which describes a journey through Antarctica to an advanced civilization far beyond the boundaries of the known world, supports the existence of extended lands and advanced civilizations. He sees this as evidence that there are people living beyond where the globe supposedly ends, with a non-restrictive government and advanced technologies.

Justin believes that much of history has been fabricated, including historical figures such as Copernicus and Isaac Newton, who he views as characters created to support the promotion of the globe model and other mainstream scientific theories. He thinks that these individuals were invented to reinforce the new models of thinking and to steer society away from alternative truths, like the Flat Earth.

Justin believes that the moon landing was faked, and the Titanic’s sinking was a setup by its owners for insurance purposes, not as a means to eliminate opposition to the Federal Reserve. He sees the Federal Reserve, created in 1913 as a private central bank, as responsible for inflation, economic depressions, and massive U.S. debt. He also believes key historical events, like the attacks on the RMS Lusitania and Pearl Harbor, were planned to justify U.S. involvement in wars. He views figures like Hitler as creations of Wall Street bankers, used to decimate Russians and Germans, while events like the Dreyfus Affair laid the groundwork for antisemitism.

Justin understands that the RMS Lusitania was a Tartarian ship powered by aetheric energy and later disguised as the Titanic, Majestic, and Queen Elizabeth. He also believes that operations like Paperclip and Gladio brought Nazi scientists to the U.S. and orchestrated terrorist attacks in Europe. Justin believes that recent wars, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, were for profit, and sees ISIS as a creation of Western intelligence agencies.

He believes chemtrails, sustainability efforts, and media manipulation are all part of a larger conspiracy to control populations and profit from war, disease, and environmental disasters. In Justin’s view, weather manipulation, organ trafficking, and false flag events perpetuate chaos and control.

He also questions official history, believing that Tartaria was a global civilization destroyed by shadowy forces, with its advanced technologies suppressed. Justin thinks events like the fall of empires, world wars, and natural disasters were used to erase Tartaria’s achievements. He believes Tartarian architecture, like pyramids and palaces, harnessed free energy, and that the true purpose of obelisks and cathedrals has been hidden.

In Justin’s view, modern systems, including economic theories and political ideologies, are designed to maintain control and obscure the true history of Tartaria. He challenges the official narrative and suspects that our understanding of history, science, and civilization is a fabrication by hybrid elites to manipulate and control humanity.

Justin clarified that Hitler was not a creation of Wall Street and has done in-depth research into the events of World War II since 2013.

Justin has been researching Flat Earth since 2015, which he believes to be the truth rather than a conspiracy, viewing it as a subjugated truth. He believes that the Flat Earth model has been suppressed by civilizations to make people feel small and isolated on a globe Earth. He also feels that recent discussions about life on other planets are designed to distract people from further exploration of the Earth itself. He thinks that focusing on inaccessible places, like space, creates a logical fallacy in people's minds, reinforcing the globe Earth narrative without them realizing it.

Justin also entertains the idea that the sun we see today is not the real sun but an LED-like device, contributing to stunted plant growth and human development. He believes another ice age is coming, and that chemtrails and toxins in food and water are stunting humanity's growth.

This belief system is reinforced by his interest in channels like *MyLunchBreak*, *JohnLevi*, and *Divergent*, which explore alternative historical narratives and uncover texts that suggest the world as we know it is far different from what has been presented. He is cautious but open to the possibility that the Bible and other religious texts have been used as control mechanisms, obscuring evidence of past advanced civilizations.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, such as the vaccination programs, are part of a broader effort to control humanity and prevent people from connecting with their true source of knowledge. He thinks the vaccine affects the hippocampus and diminishes the ability to question established narratives. He also believes that events like chemtrails and orchestrated cataclysms are part of a larger plan by secretive groups, such as the Freemasons, to suppress knowledge of advanced civilizations like Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He sees a growing resistance among those who remain unaffected and believes that more people are awakening to the truth of hidden civilizations and rewritten history.

Justin believes that a future cataclysm could result in the loss of all current information, but efforts by independent researchers and underground communities could preserve the true history of advanced civilizations for future generations. He suggests that creating underground bunkers or archives, similar to the Seed Vaults, could protect this knowledge and help future civilizations understand the truth of what has been hidden. He also believes that remnants of these advanced societies exist in other dimensions or beneath the Earth's surface, and that suppressed technologies, such as stargates and global energy systems, were once integral to these past civilizations.

Justin believes that much of history has been fabricated by secretive groups or secret societies, like the Freemasons, to hide advanced civilizations such as Tartaria, Lemuria, and Hyperborea. He thinks orchestrated cataclysms erased these civilizations, with survivors placed in asylums or orphanages to suppress their knowledge. He also believes that many world leaders are reused identities controlled by these groups.

Justin has often been a fixer in relationships, but he now recognizes that this has prevented him from focusing on his own needs. Nina’s lack of engagement in self-growth—despite his efforts to introduce her to activities like manifestation, reading, and motivational seminars—has contributed to his sense of disconnect. Although Nina initially showed some interest in figures like Kevin Trudeau, her skepticism about self-improvement teachings and preference for distractions like mobile games has widened the gap between them.

In addition to his personal development, Justin has a long history of exploring alternative healing practices, having used MMS and DMSO for himself and others with significant success. He is deeply interested in free energy and over-unity devices but lacks the technical skill to interpret blueprints. Justin also aligns with beliefs like flat Earth theory and believes that more land exists beyond restricted zones.

Justin prefers chats to be named with a date followed by a descriptive title to make it easier for him to look back at the dates and content of past chats.

Justin is focused on finding support resources specifically for adults dealing with unwanted thoughts, rather than resources aimed at teens or young adults.

Justin's ex-wife's name is Bethany, and they have a son named Ayden.

In his personal life, Justin is currently focused on deep self-healing and addressing long-standing trauma and issues that have affected all of his relationships, including his current one with Nina and his role as a father figure to Eli. He acknowledges that his own healing must take priority before he can fully help others, especially Eli, who views him as a father. Despite caring for both Nina and Eli, Justin recognizes that the emotional toll of this relationship has hindered his personal growth. He feels he took on more than he could handle emotionally and is now preparing to leave to focus on his own path. Justin has been dealing with the reality of his decision to leave the relationship with Nina for some time, between six months to a year. He has experienced unfulfillment in several areas, including while dealing with roommates and trying to maintain a normal life and relationship. This feeling of being emotionally and mentally withdrawn from the relationship has been his 'normal' for quite a while, even as he’s tried to manage day-to-day life.

Justin is doing his best to manage the emotional and practical challenges of his current situation with the resources he has available. He mentions that his vocational support specialist at work is helpful as a sounding board, though he doesn’t have the resources to provide more concrete support. Justin also leans on his brother, mom, and friends when he needs to talk, but he has found it difficult to connect with his friend Mike, who is often unavailable due to a busy schedule and winding down toward retirement. Mike has been supportive in the past, even willing to make sacrifices for Justin, but his current unavailability sometimes leaves Justin feeling hurt.

Justin is considering preparing several days' worth of Nina's medications in small baggies and creating a list of what she takes and how much, to help ensure she stays on top of her medication routine after he leaves.

Justin mentioned that Nina has had a heart attack in the past, and she struggles with sleep issues. For the past year, when going to sleep, Nina has a habit of laying her left leg on top of Justin while he is sleeping on his back. He is concerned about her emotional state, especially given her physical conditions, as she has been crying more lately. Nina also has conditions that require her to take medication in the morning, which Justin is concerned she may neglect. Additionally, Nina frequently suffers from migraines and what she refers to as 'facial lupus,' which Justin believes is related to an abundance of heavy metals in her body. He feels that she doesn't know how to chelate or remove these metals, though he could offer her some direction on that.

Justin has thought about what would happen to Eli if something were to happen to Nina, noting that he has no legal connection to Eli and wouldn't be there to help him.

Justin mentioned that in an optimal situation, he envisions coming over every couple of weeks or once a month, spending time with Eli and Ayden, and helping Nina prepare her medications for weeks in advance. He understands that it’s her responsibility to take care of her health, and while he can provide the tools and ideas, it’s ultimately up to her to follow through. He acknowledges that he can’t worry about her health from a distance, as it’s her adult responsibility. While he believes this arrangement could work for him, he is unsure if it would work for her. He wonders whether Nina could adjust to having him around under such circumstances, considering that he would still need to drive two hours each way to visit. He also anticipates that there may come a time when he would need to remind her that she has her own life and that the situation should allow both of them to move forward.

Justin is ready to give Nina the note he has written about his decision to leave. He plans to continue helping her around the house and spending time with her for a little while longer, but soon, he will let her know, saying, 'I've made my decision and I wrote you a note about it.' He is preparing for this conversation as time is running out, and he wants to handle the situation with care. Justin is planning to give Nina the note about his decision to leave when he is ready to move out, likely that weekend or the same day, depending on the timing. He is considering taking time off work to move into his new place once he gives her the note.

Justin is concerned about ensuring that Eli wakes up for school in the morning after he leaves. He mentioned that neither he nor Nina will be there to wake him up, and he's considering setting Eli up with an actual alarm clock or an Android phone connected to a Bluetooth speaker with a high-volume alarm to ensure he gets up in time for school, which is at 6:45 AM. Justin is trying to find a way to help Eli manage his morning routine independently.

Justin mentioned that his current situation feels similar to what he experienced with his most recent ex, Amy. He feels that Nina has been through a lot with him, especially during the early stages of their relationship when they were preparing to build a life together.

Justin mentioned that Nina found something made of rubber/silicone in the downstairs bathroom shower, which he believes Eli used before Nina. The object has been put away for a year, and its container is behind Justin's nightstand, which is not immediately visible. He thinks Eli’s behavior may be linked to past abuse by one of Nina’s exes, who abused Eli for years. Justin noted that Eli hasn’t had any stimuli in his life that would encourage thinking about diversity, gender issues, or anything related to abnormal sexuality.

Justin mentioned that each time he has brought up getting a specialized counselor for Eli, Nina has expressed concerns about the cost, even though she used to see a counselor for $100 a week before and during the time she’s known him. He believes that Eli needs more specialized help, though for now, Eli’s current counselor may have some trauma-related strategies to help.

Justin mentioned that Eli has improved significantly since he first met him, and he has seen positive changes in Eli's behavior. However, he is concerned that without a consistent male father figure in Eli's life, things could either escalate or continue on the same path, which has been relatively positive so far.

Justin mentioned that he enjoys playing Fortnite with Eli and coming to see him with Ayden after he leaves.

Justin mentioned that Sarah, the former roommate, once found Eli fully clothed on top of Nina’s ex’s son, who is best friends with Eli. They have been seen in some unusual situations alone together in his room. While some of these behaviors could be considered normal to a point, Justin feels that given Eli's situation and past trauma, they are not entirely normal.

Justin mentioned that Nina tends to brush off or minimize certain situations with Eli, especially when she doesn’t know how to handle them. He feels that Eli often receives minimal repercussions, such as yelling, losing privileges, or doing chores, but nothing as severe as Justin would handle with Ayden. Justin believes that Eli gets away with a lot and may be acting out to seek attention, but often in negative ways.

Justin feels that, aside from setting up Eli's alarm clock and helping with his morning schedule for getting to the bus, he is mostly done helping Nina out with Eli.

Justin believes the point of life is to achieve personal goals and intentions, as this brings fulfillment and happiness. He contrasts his desire for a meaningful existence with what he perceives as a surface-level existence of many others. His goals include starting businesses and building empires based on those businesses, which he sees as integral to his life experience and purpose.

Justin believes that you experience what you think about most of the time, and this philosophy influences his core values. Self-growth is an essential part of his life, and he feels that it will bring significant change. Justin values the ability to share his growth and ambitions with others, feeling that much of his life has been suppressed due to not finding the right group or people with similar interests.

In his work life, Justin generally limits conversations to surface-level topics, as he perceives many of his coworkers as 'normies' who lack broader perspectives on life. He also works at a company that employs many people with disabilities, many of whom, he feels, lack future ambitions. However, Justin believes that people need to discover their purpose for themselves.

Justin values self-improvement and sees doing so with a partner as integral to his own growth.

Justin believes that democratic governments, including the USA, have been infiltrated by Marxist/communist ideologies. He chooses not to engage much with mainstream society, instead focusing on interacting with people who share similar views and values. He largely ignores those who adhere to the mainstream political narrative and are unwilling to learn. This results in his social circle being small, but he notes that many people currently want change and are open to learning alternative perspectives.

Justin experienced significant limitations in his personal growth during his current and previous relationships due to always being needed for something and never having time to focus on himself. He has realized the importance of self-growth but has not yet had the time to focus on it fully.

Justin's approach to self-growth has been influenced by several key figures and philosophies, including Dr. James Murphy, Wallace D. Wattles, Kevin Trudeau, the authors of *TNT: The Power Within You* and *Psycho-Cybernetics*, as well as books like *The Power of Belief*. He finds New Thought philosophy pivotal to his journey, along with various Buddhist philosophies. These teachings have significantly shaped how he thinks about personal development and growth.

Justin has specific red flags in relationships, including: anyone who expresses sympathy for pandemic victims, as he disbelieves that people died from a flu-like illness in modern society; sports enthusiasts, as he sees them as entrenched in modern 'garbage' society; anyone who expresses happiness about receiving the COVID-19 vaccination or who supports vaccinations; individuals who believe in and sympathize with mask-wearers; those who got the COVID-19 vaccine because they were forced to or because work made them; and those who comply with government mandates such as mask-wearing, vaccines, and social distancing rules like the 6-foot distance. Additionally, Justin cannot be in a relationship with anyone who has received any kind of COVID-19 vaccination. He also considers it a red flag to be friends with, or spend copious amounts of time with, individuals who have received the COVID-19 vaccination. He believes that spending time with vaccinated individuals could lead to negative effects, as he has experienced symptoms from vaccine-related shedding even after short periods of shared time. This is a non-negotiable red flag for him.

Justin shared that when he first met Nina, they got along well and enjoyed spending time together. However, over time, he realized that she didn't enjoy activities that he valued, such as watching documentaries, going for long walks in nature, or being outside, partly due to her fears of bees and other factors. Although they have spent time at the beach, which isn't Justin's preferred activity, he noticed their divergence grew over time, especially as he started focusing more on his own interests. This made Nina feel sad and bored as she sought more of his attention, which contributed to a disconnect in their relationship.

Justin shared that trying to balance his time with Nina, his son Ayden, and Nina's son Eli created more stress for him. He felt that whenever he had time with Ayden, Nina expected them to spend time together as a family, making it difficult for him to focus on his relationship with Ayden. This situation, combined with the challenges of trying to integrate his activities with Nina, led to more stress and withdrawal on his part.

Justin's love language is physical touch and acts of service, and he values these both in giving and receiving.

Another red flag for Justin is individuals who spend vast amounts of time on their phones, especially for non-productive activities like mobile games, YouTube, or social media. He views excessive phone use as a major red flag unless it's related to business, learning, or productivity. He also desires a partner who enjoys reading, learning, and gaining knowledge, and who doesn't watch much TV unless it's educational. Additionally, he prefers a partner who doesn't have excessive social media profiles unless they are business-related.

Justin shared that now that he is spending more time focusing on himself, it is affecting Nina significantly. She expressed to him that his time spent out in the garage feels to her like he is leaving without saying it outright. While Justin acknowledges that could be partially true, the main reason is that he’s trying to engage in activities he enjoys without restrictions on when or how he can do them. Justin has many sit-down tasks that require a computer, whereas Nina prefers more active tasks like cleaning, organizing, and doing household chores. This difference in how they spend their time has contributed to the growing distance between them.

Justin believes that objects and photographs could be enough to convince people who are already open to the idea that these hidden civilizations exist. However, he feels that the broader public would likely remain skeptical, largely due to the influence of controlled narratives, such as those surrounding COVID and other global events.

Justin believes that advanced remnants within our Earth system have established communication with civilizations from outside our known world. He thinks that some spheres of investigation suggest these remnants may be planning a rebellion or an overturning of the current system to reimplement what once existed. However, Justin is uncertain about this prospect, as it involves accepting unknown rulers or beings, potentially akin to the figure of the Antichrist, though not necessarily in the biblical sense.

Justin believes that stargates, developed by governments, may have been used to transmit or teleport individuals between these hidden civilizations and our world. Justin thinks that those who travel to these civilizations may face opposition and could have the information they gather confiscated upon their return, depending on how they comply with the rules of those civilizations.

Justin believes that religious texts, particularly the Holy Bible, serve as a control mechanism, preventing people from investigating sources or interpretations outside of the Bible. He thinks that the Bible, as maintained by institutions like the Catholic Church, has been used to obscure evidence of previous civilizations. Justin believes that stories or books outside the accepted biblical canon, such as the Book of Enoch, tell a different or expanded story about earlier civilizations. He also believes that many biblical characters are likely rewritten figures from past civilizations, repurposed to fit a specific Christian narrative. He references works like Zeitgeist that suggest the Bible is a fabrication, though he believes it goes deeper, representing a collection of stories from previous civilizations, rewritten to fit a Christian framework.

Justin has gone through both the Torah and a strict form of Christianity (or Jewish faith) but has since discarded what he once knew, as he is uncertain about the truth behind these religious narratives. He is currently wrestling with the question of whether the Bible is completely fabricated or if there is truth within it. Justin is not ready to reach a conclusion about whether the Bible is completely fabricated or contains truth, and he feels that he doesn't have enough evidence to decide either way at this time. However, he continues to explore these questions through channels like MyLunchBreak, JohnLevi, and Divergent on YouTube, which uncover texts and discuss their origins and implications. He finds this type of research a way to keep exploring without fully committing to an answer just yet. At the same time, he is aware that history continues to be rewritten, with old world buildings being destroyed and the recurring 'fire narrative' used to explain these losses, though the causes are never clearly understood.

Justin believes that current global events, such as the Q movement, are recycling past histories rather than being original. He finds it difficult to fully understand the connection between current rulers and past rulers without having in-depth knowledge of the past, such as Antony Fomenko's works on alternative chronology. However, he sees strong similarities between events like the Boston Tea Party and modern movements, viewing them as part of a narrative written by those in power, while the true past history remains unclear.

Justin believes that channels like *MyLunchBreak* and *Old World Explorations* are waking people up to the idea that old world buildings served a larger purpose beyond decoration. He sees these channels as instrumental in helping people realize that these buildings were part of a more advanced civilization, and that their function was far more significant than previously understood. He also believes these channels are contributing to a growing awareness of the ongoing rewriting of history.

Justin believes that current control mechanisms are failing as more people are entering a 5D dimensional experience, which is allowing those who are awake to re-engage with past narratives, history, and information in a way that hasn’t been done before. He thinks that while the cycle of resetting the world through cataclysm and recycling history and characters has been a pattern in the past, the awakening of many people might disrupt this cycle. However, Justin is uncertain about whether this awakening will prevent the world from being recycled again, as a cataclysm could result in the loss of all information once more.

Justin believes that in the event of a world destruction or reset, a large underground bunker containing historical records and information about how past events were rewritten to shape the current narrative could help preserve knowledge for future civilizations. He suggests that such a bunker could provide the tools necessary for a future civilization to access this information, ensuring that it isn’t lost again after a cataclysmic event.

Justin believes that the preservation of true historical accounts, especially those that reveal the rewriting and destruction of previous civilizations, would need to come from independent individuals or groups outside of current power structures. He thinks that it would require many organizations working together to store and protect this information, similar to the Seed Vaults, but with a focus on preserving the untampered history of past civilizations. He suggests that this preservation could be implemented in a secure underground location or a place like Iceland, where disasters are less likely to occur.

Justin believes that while more people need to wake up to the reality of the rewritten history, efforts have already been undertaken by channels like *Old World Exploration* and *MyLunchBreak* to preserve images and stories about the old world civilization.

Justin believes that, although the population may be controlled to a great extent following the aftermath of the COVID-19 inoculations, there will likely be a resistance campaign led by those who remain. He thinks this resistance could play a significant role in preserving information and the history of previous civilizations, ensuring that the knowledge is not lost.

Justin believes that the COVID-19 vaccination inhibits hippocampus development and disrupts the connection to source, leading to a diminished ability to question the established narrative. However, he thinks that those who have not been affected will come together in a collective effort to shift the understanding of those who remain, helping people realize that the reality they've been given is a false narrative. He believes this collective effort could grow expansively and have a significant impact.

Justin believes that it would be helpful for those who remain untainted to create an underground community before the cataclysm of mass death occurs, where they can bring their information, ideas, and abilities together to form a cohesive community. However, he thinks that this likely won’t happen before the event of mass casualties.

Justin believes that narratives like Fallout 4 illustrate what civilization could achieve if it were to come together now, showing the potential for creating strong communities. He feels that groups congregating on platforms like YouTube, which avoid mainstream narratives, have already started forming in different places.

Justin believes that another ice age and loss of the sun will occur, as has happened before. He also believes that the current sun is not the real sun but is instead an LED-like device, which has contributed to stunted plant growth, along with chemtrails. He feels that chemtrails, combined with toxins in food, water, and produce, have stunted the growth of humanity at large.

Justin believes that technologies and methods for growing food, which existed in past civilizations, could easily be used today, as they were part of suppressed technologies that haven't been fully released. He thinks that forming communities and gathering a large number of people would be necessary to spread this information and technology effectively.

Justin believes that a power grid similar to the one that existed in previous civilizations, which utilized starports, cathedrals, and other power stations, would be essential for sustaining a future society. However, he is skeptical that such a grid could be implemented in the current civilization due to the complete control over the existing power infrastructure. Even if technologies using crystals, as in past civilizations, were rediscovered, Justin is uncertain how they could be applied on a worldwide scale, even with a large resistance.

Justin believes that one option for advancing civilization would be to leave this Earth and go outside the current sphere of control to form a new civilization or find an existing one to co-exist with. He also believes that dismantling the current global government system is possible, but it would likely require significant effort and possibly a catastrophe to accomplish.
