*Desc:* Since the arrival of the Synthesizer, no other 20th-century musical instrument has had such a profound and far-reaching impact on Musical culture.

Pearlman and Dennis Colin sought to create a more portable version of their massive ARP 2500 modular synth which they could market more towards musicians. Out of this concept came the ARP 2600 semi-modul
