### **Nina**
1. Justin has been dealing with the reality of his decision to leave the relationship with Nina for some time, between six months to a year. He has experienced unfulfillment in several areas, including while dealing with roommates and trying to maintain a normal life and relationship. This feeling of being emotionally and mentally withdrawn from the relationship has been his 'normal' for quite a while, even as he’s tried to manage day-to-day life.
2. Justin is concerned about ensuring that Eli wakes up for school in the morning after he leaves. He mentioned that neither he nor Nina will be there to wake him up, and he's considering setting Eli up with an actual alarm clock or an Android phone connected to a Bluetooth speaker with a high-volume alarm to ensure he gets up in time for school, which is at 6:45 AM. Justin is trying to find a way to help Eli manage his morning routine independently.
3. Justin shared that now that he is spending more time focusing on himself, it is affecting Nina significantly. She expressed to him that his time spent out in the garage feels to her like he is leaving without saying it outright. While Justin acknowledges that could be partially true, the main reason is that he’s trying to engage in activities he enjoys without restrictions on when or how he can do them. Justin has many sit-down tasks that require a computer, whereas Nina prefers more active tasks like cleaning, organizing, and doing household chores. This difference in how they spend their time has contributed to the growing distance between them.
4. Justin shared that Nina found something made of rubber/silicone in the downstairs bathroom shower, which he believes Eli used before Nina. The object has been put away for a year, and its container is behind Justin's nightstand, which is not immediately visible. He thinks Eli’s behavior may be linked to past abuse by one of Nina’s exes, who abused Eli for years. Justin noted that Eli hasn’t had any stimuli in his life that would encourage thinking about diversity, gender issues, or anything related to abnormal sexuality.
5. Justin mentioned that Nina tends to brush off or minimize certain situations with Eli, especially when she doesn’t know how to handle them. He feels that Eli often receives minimal repercussions, such as yelling, losing privileges, or doing chores, but nothing as severe as Justin would handle with Ayden. Justin believes that Eli gets away with a lot and may be acting out to seek attention, but often in negative ways.
6. Justin feels that, aside from setting up Eli's alarm clock and helping with his morning schedule for getting to the bus, he is mostly done helping Nina out with Eli.
7. Justin is ready to give Nina the note he has written about his decision to leave. He plans to continue helping her around the house and spending time with her for a little while longer, but soon, he will let her know, saying, 'I've made my decision and I wrote you a note about it.' He is preparing for this conversation as time is running out, and he wants to handle the situation with care. Justin is planning to give Nina the note about his decision to leave when he is ready to move out, likely that weekend or the same day, depending on the timing. He is considering taking time off work to move into his new place once he gives her the note.
8. Justin shared that trying to balance his time with Nina, his son Ayden, and Nina's son Eli created more stress for him. He felt that whenever he had time with Ayden, Nina expected them to spend time together as a family, making it difficult for him to focus on his relationship with Ayden. This situation, combined with the challenges of trying to integrate his activities with Nina, led to more stress and withdrawal on his part.
9. Justin mentioned that each time he has brought up getting a specialized counselor for Eli, Nina has expressed concerns about the cost, even though she used to see a counselor for $100 a week before and during the time she’s known him. He believes that Eli needs more specialized help, though for now, Eli’s current counselor may have some trauma-related strategies to help.
10. Justin has thought about what would happen to Eli if something were to happen to Nina, noting that he has no legal connection to Eli and wouldn't be there to help him.
11. Justin mentioned that in an optimal situation, he envisions coming over every couple of weeks or once a month, spending time with Eli and Ayden, and helping Nina prepare her medications for weeks in advance. He understands that it’s her responsibility to take care of her health, and while he can provide the tools and ideas, it’s ultimately up to her to follow through. He acknowledges that he can’t worry about her health from a distance, as it’s her adult responsibility. While he believes this arrangement could work for him, he is unsure if it would work for her. He wonders whether Nina could adjust to having him around under such circumstances, considering that he would still need to drive two hours each way to visit. He also anticipates that there may come a time when he would need to remind her that she has her own life and that the situation should allow both of them to move forward.
12. Justin shared that his love for affection and giving attention has often taken up too much of his time in past relationships, time that he feels could have been better spent learning and taking actions to achieve his goals. He feels that much of the time spent with women has been unproductive.
13. Justin mentioned that when he first met Nina, they got along well and enjoyed spending time together. However, over time, he realized that she didn't enjoy activities that he valued, such as watching documentaries, going for long walks in nature, or being outside, partly due to her fears of bees and other factors. Although they have spent time at the beach, which isn't Justin's preferred activity, he noticed their divergence grew over time, especially as he started focusing more on his own interests. This made Nina feel sad and bored as she sought more of his attention, which contributed to a disconnect in their relationship.
14. Justin shared that when he first met Nina, they shared poems and songs, and she shared her college research papers with him, which led him to believe she was more of a creative person with a love for learning. However, over time, Justin realized that Nina’s love for learning diminished, and she has mostly stuck to subjects she already knows. Though she has made attempts to learn with him, Justin noticed that she often avoided watching documentaries he felt were important, and when they did watch them together, she would frequently fall asleep.
15. Justin feels that Nina makes a good friend but not an ideal lover or partner, as he doesn't believe she has a strong understanding of how to navigate a relationship.

5. Justin mentioned that Sarah, the former roommate, once found Eli fully clothed on top of Nina’s ex’s son, who is best friends with Eli. They have been seen in some unusual situations alone together in his room. While some of these behaviors could be considered normal to a point, Justin feels that given Eli's situation and past trauma, they are not entirely normal.

Justin mentioned that in an optimal situation, he envisions coming over every couple of weeks or once a month, spending time with Eli and Ayden, and helping Nina prepare her medications for weeks in advance.
