**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Let's build a unconventional KBA. 

KBA:0000012345: All Agencies - How to avoid receiving negative customer feedback(actually make it about that). 

Use this KBA as the structure for layout and formatting, etc.

**ASSISTANT**: Perfect. Based on the structure of **KBA00086261 FS PDF Creating PDF Files**, I‚Äôve crafted an unconventional KBA titled:

## **FS: Customer Service: Avoiding Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Avoiding negative feedback isn't just about solving problems‚Äîit's about preventing them. Below are actionable tips and strategies to help reduce or eliminate customer complaints:

---

### üîç **1. Practice Active Listening**

- Repeat back what the customer says to show understanding.
- Don‚Äôt interrupt; let them finish speaking.
- Take notes on key issues or concerns.

> **Example:**  
> *Customer: ‚ÄúMy printer hasn‚Äôt worked for 3 days.‚Äù*  
> *You: ‚ÄúSo your printer has been down for three days, and you haven‚Äôt been able to complete your print jobs. Let‚Äôs get this solved for you.‚Äù*

---

### ‚ú® **2. Set Realistic Expectations**

- Don‚Äôt overpromise. Instead, say:  
  ‚ÄúI will do everything I can to help resolve this.‚Äù  
- Give accurate timeframes and update them if things change.

> **Avoid:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have it fixed in 5 minutes!‚Äù  
> **Try instead:** ‚ÄúI expect to have a resolution within 15-20 minutes, but I‚Äôll keep you updated.‚Äù

---

### üß∞ **3. Use Positive Language**

Words matter. Reframe negatives into positives:
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí ‚úÖ ‚ÄúWhat I can do is‚Ä¶‚Äù
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí ‚úÖ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find the closest solution.‚Äù

---

### üõë **4. Don‚Äôt Transfer Without Context**

If escalation or transfer is required:
- Always summarize the issue to the next agent.
- Tell the customer *why* the transfer is necessary and stay on the line until handoff is complete.

> **Avoid:** ‚ÄúLet me transfer you.‚Äù  
> **Try:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to connect you to our specialist, and I‚Äôll explain your issue so you don‚Äôt have to repeat it.‚Äù

---

### üïäÔ∏è **5. Stay Calm When They‚Äôre Not**

- Keep your voice calm, no matter their tone.
- Empathize: ‚ÄúI can hear this has been frustrating for you.‚Äù
- Take a deep breath before responding.

---

### üßô **6. Resolve More Than They Asked**

Where possible, go above:
- Solve the problem **and** offer a tip, resource, or shortcut.
- Provide your name and a reference number to create trust.

---

### üí° **7. Follow Up**

If you‚Äôve promised a callback or status update‚Äîdo it.
- This builds reputation and keeps problems from escalating.
- Even a quick, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still working on it‚Äù earns big points.

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**  
Apply these principles in all customer interactions. If a customer is already upset, escalate gently and document the concern in full detail. Use the language: ‚ÄúCustomer has expressed dissatisfaction and would like resolution.‚Äù

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**  
No specific routing required. This is universal advice for all agencies. Assign incident to yourself if further escalation is not necessary.

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Receiving negative feedback is often a symptom of preventable service breakdowns. Use the strategies below to create a smooth, emotionally attuned customer experience, and reduce the risk of escalations or poor satisfaction scores (CSATs).

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Validate the Customer Immediately**
- Start with empathy: ‚ÄúI can understand how frustrating that must be.‚Äù
- Let them know you‚Äôre here to help *right away.*

---

### **2. Use the Remedy Flow Structure for Confidence**
When working in Remedy:
- **Update Incident People record** with customer‚Äôs *live* info, not just directory values.
- **KBA Matching:** Ensure the KBA used matches **FS** domain. Attach it properly.
- **Clear Summary:** Include impacted system + issue. Be specific.
- **Notes:** Include exact error messages, troubleshooting steps, and actions.
- **Resolution Note (Public):** Clearly document steps taken and results.

---

### **3. Set Realistic Expectations ‚Äî and Meet Them**
- **Underpromise, overdeliver.**
- Give them timeframes you can meet (even if it's just a callback).
- If a delay happens, **update them proactively.**

---

### **4. Don‚Äôt Transfer Blindly**
- Explain *why* you‚Äôre transferring.
- Offer to stay on the line.
- If routing in Remedy, confirm correct group and update assignment fields.

> **Example:** ‚ÄúI'm going to connect you with our Tier 2 team who specialize in this issue. I‚Äôll pass along everything so you don‚Äôt have to repeat yourself.‚Äù

---

### **5. Document Like They‚Äôll See It ‚Äî Because They Might**
- Avoid short or vague entries like ‚ÄúHelped user‚Äù or ‚ÄúFixed it.‚Äù
- Use the **Resolution Note for Customer** to provide a clear, positive final message:
  
  > ‚ÄúResolved the printing issue by clearing the print queue and restarting the spooler. Confirmed with the customer that they can now print successfully. Provided callback number in case issue recurs.‚Äù

---

## üí¨ Communication Do's and Don‚Äôts

| Do | Don‚Äôt |
|----|------|
| Speak slowly and clearly | Talk over the customer |
| Stay calm if they get upset | Get defensive or match their tone |
| Ask permission before placing on hold | Leave them hanging |
| End every call with: ‚ÄúIs there anything else I can help with today?‚Äù | Just say ‚Äúbye‚Äù or hang up |

---

### **Extra Tools to Win the Call**

- **Soft Hold**: Stay engaged during pauses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just pulling that up now.‚Äù
- **Name Use**: Call them by name at least twice.
- **Re-Cap**: Repeat back final fix and next steps.

---

### üö´ Red Flags That Lead to Negative Feedback
- Telling the user they‚Äôre wrong
- Sounding rushed or annoyed
- Long silences without updates
- Failing to follow up when promised
- Not documenting the issue thoroughly

---

### üìå When Escalation is Unavoidable:
- Be honest about the handoff.
- Note the escalation reason *in Remedy*.
- Provide a reference number and callback path.

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**  
Apply emotional intelligence, proper Remedy process, and clear documentation.

Use:  
- **Assigned Group** = USDA IT Service Desk  
- **Resolution Method** = Service Desk Assisted  
- **Resolution** = Fix steps + confirmation or callback

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**  
Follow Remedy Flow:  
- If resolved, status = *Resolved* and Reason = *No Further Action*.  
- If routing, ensure summary and notes support reassignment.

Would you like this exported to **PDF**, **DOCX**, or both? I can match the KBA format exactly and apply USDA branding if needed.

**TOOL**: All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**USER**: (We don't generally call back, unless authorized(remove that part))
And "routing" would be instead of transferring. I.e. Since this requires higher privileges / tools than the CHD has, I'll need to route this up to Tier 2. (no timelines for tier 2, mention that their workload depends on how the ticket is handled / the order received, cordially, and kindly)

**ASSISTANT**: Got it. Here is the revised **KBA0000012345**, incorporating your corrections:

- ‚ùå Removed mention of **calling back** (unless explicitly authorized).
- ‚úÖ Replaced **"transferring"** with **"routing"** (aligned with CHD + Tier 2 language).
- ‚úÖ Clarified **no timeline guarantees** for Tier 2; included a **kind, accurate explanation** of their workflow.

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback often comes from breakdowns in clarity, empathy, or expectations. These steps help CHD agents navigate calls smoothly, using practical communication and Remedy best practices to reduce complaints and elevate the customer experience.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Validate the Customer Immediately**
- Begin with warmth and empathy:  
  *‚ÄúI understand how frustrating that must be.‚Äù*  
- Let them know they‚Äôve got your full attention.

---

### **2. Follow the FS Remedy Flow with Intention**
When working in Remedy:
- **Update Incident People record** with the customer‚Äôs current details.
- **Attach accurate FS KBA** and verify its relevance to their issue.
- **Use clear summaries** that include the system affected + symptom.
- **Notes:** Include error messages *verbatim*, user-reported behavior, and actions taken.
- **Resolution Note (Public):** Write it like it‚Äôs going in their report‚Äîbecause it is.

---

### **3. Set Realistic Expectations**
- **Be honest about what you can do at CHD level.**
- Avoid giving time estimates, especially for Tier 2 cases.
- Instead, say something like:  
  > *‚ÄúThis will be routed to our Tier 2 support team. Their workload is dynamic, so it will be handled in the order received and based on the details in the ticket.‚Äù*

---

### **4. Route‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Just Transfer**
- If an issue requires tools or permissions CHD does not have, **route** to Tier 2 via Remedy.
- Clearly explain this to the customer:

> *‚ÄúSince this requires higher-level access than we have here at CHD, I‚Äôll route your ticket to our Tier 2 support team. They‚Äôll pick it up based on their queue order and the information provided in this ticket.‚Äù*

- Make sure the **Assigned Group** is accurate.
- Double-check **Owner Group/Owner** and fill out all required categorization fields.

---

### **5. Use Professional, Positive Language**
Words matter:
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúWhat I *can* do is‚Ä¶‚Äù  
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go ahead and take care of that.‚Äù  
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to‚Ä¶‚Äù  
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my job‚Ä¶‚Äù

---

### **6. Document Like It‚Äôs Public (Because It Might Be)**

- Be specific. Skip one-liners like ‚Äúhelped user.‚Äù
- Example Resolution Note:  
  > ‚ÄúCleared printer queue and restarted spooler service. User confirmed printing now works as expected. Routed to Tier 2 if issue persists.‚Äù

- For Public View: paste your resolution and set **View Access** to *Public*.

---

### üí¨ Communication Do's and Don‚Äôts

| ‚úÖ Do | ‚ùå Don‚Äôt |
|------|---------|
| Use the customer‚Äôs name | Sound robotic |
| Speak clearly and kindly | Use tech jargon they don‚Äôt understand |
| Ask permission before placing on hold | Leave them in silence |
| Close with: ‚ÄúIs there anything else I can help with today?‚Äù | Rush the end of the call |

---

### üö´ Common Pitfalls That Lead to Negative Feedback
- Sounding rushed or unengaged
- Failing to update the customer
- Not capturing error details
- Telling users to "try later" without explanation
- Using ‚Äútone‚Äù instead of clear, calm speech

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**  
Use empathy, FS Remedy flow, and clean documentation.

- **Assigned Group** = USDA IT Service Desk  
- **Resolution Method** = Service Desk Assisted  
- **Resolution** = What was done + outcome + next steps (if any)

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**  
If the issue exceeds CHD permissions or tools:
- Route to Tier 2 with full notes and summary.
- Do not promise timelines.  
- Let the customer know:  
  *‚ÄúTier 2 will address it based on their current ticket queue and issue type. You‚Äôll be contacted through this ticket if more information is needed.‚Äù*

‚úÖ Ready to export. Would you like:

- **DOCX**
- **Both**  
...and should it include a USDA-style header/footer or be left plain?

**ASSISTANT**: Thanks, Justin. With the **Forest Service Phone Script** added, I‚Äôve now **fully integrated it** into the KBA. This includes proper phrasing for greetings, placing on hold, identity proofing, and closing the call‚Äîall within the practical scope of *avoiding negative feedback.*

Here is the **FINALIZED VERSION** of:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**  
**VERSION#: 1**  
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback often comes from mismatched expectations or poor communication. This guide aligns FS standards, CHD Remedy protocol, and live-call etiquette to ensure smoother interactions and higher satisfaction.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Use the Official Greeting to Set the Tone**

> **‚ÄúThank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk.  
My name is [Your Name].  
May I please have your first and last name?‚Äù**

- If needed:  
  > ‚ÄúCan you please spell your first/last name for me?‚Äù  
  > ‚ÄúAre you calling regarding an existing ticket or a new request?‚Äù

---

### **2. Validate the Customer Immediately**
- Let them know you‚Äôre listening:  
  > *‚ÄúI can understand how frustrating that must be. Let‚Äôs take care of it together.‚Äù*
- Stay grounded and calm, especially if they are not.

---

### **3. Follow the FS Remedy Flow With Intention**
When in Remedy:
- **Verify Incident People record.** Update with what the customer tells you live.
- **Attach the correct FS KBA.**
- **Summarize clearly** (e.g., ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt access OneDrive from FS-XXXX device‚Äù).
- **Document Notes** with exact messages and behaviors. Don‚Äôt skip error codes.
- **Public Resolution Notes** should feel confident, clear, and complete.

---

### **4. Set Accurate Expectations‚ÄîKindly**

If routing is required:

> **‚ÄúSince this issue requires tools or access beyond what we have here at CHD, I‚Äôll route your ticket to our Tier 2 support team. They‚Äôll handle it based on their queue and ticket load.‚Äù**

- üïí **No timelines should be promised**. Tier 2‚Äôs speed depends on current workload and ticket priority.

---

### **5. Use FS Language When Placing on Hold**

> ‚ÄúMay I please place you on hold while I investigate the issue?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúThank you for holding / Thank you for your patience.‚Äù

Never place on hold without asking. Avoid dead silence.

---

### **6. Professional Language Matters**

- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúLet me check on that for you.‚Äù  
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúWhat I can do here is‚Ä¶‚Äù  
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to‚Ä¶‚Äù  
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

---

### **7. Closing the Call Like a Pro**

Before disconnecting:

> ‚ÄúHave I resolved your issue today?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúYour ticket number will be sent to your email. Would you like it now as well?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúThank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. Have a great day!‚Äù

---

### üí¨ Communication Do's and Don‚Äôts

| ‚úÖ Do | ‚ùå Don‚Äôt |
|------|---------|
| Speak slowly and clearly | Talk too fast or sound rushed |
| Use the customer‚Äôs name | Refer to them impersonally |

---

### üö´ Red Flags That Lead to Negative Feedback

üì§ Would you like this exported as:

Let me know if you'd like the **USDA header/footer added** for authenticity.

**TOOL**: All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**USER**: The FS Remedy template? 

They should use the template per the KBA being used for the call. And if it's a NoKBA call, then use the Request for information(IT) or Request for information(nonIT) Template, and use the NoKBA KBA.

**ASSISTANT**: Perfectly clarified. Based on your correction and the **No KBA process documentation** (KBA00099214 and the flow chart), I‚Äôve updated the KBA to reflect accurate instructions:

- ‚úî Replaced ‚ÄúFS Remedy Template‚Äù with: *‚ÄúUse the template associated with the KBA being followed.‚Äù*
- ‚úî If **no KBA applies**, use the **Request for Information (IT)** or **Request for Information (non-IT)** template, attach **KBA00099214**, and follow **No KBA process**.

Here is the **fully corrected and finalized version** of:

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Start Strong with the Official FS Greeting**

> ‚ÄúThank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk.  
My name is [Your Name].  
May I please have your first and last name?‚Äù

- If needed:

---

### **5. Ask Before Placing on Hold**

Never mute or disappear without notice.

---

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**

If escalation is needed:

‚úÖ Ready to export. Would you like:

- **PDF**
- **DOCX**
- **Both**

Also, should this version be formatted with **USDA branding** or kept **plain?**

**TOOL**: All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**USER**: (for nokba, only 3 are necessary to avoid oversearching when no KBA is clearly available, although more keywords can be attached if there may be multiple ways to search for something that clearly should be a KBA((This is just my advice as an agent))

**ASSISTANT**: Perfectly stated, Justin. I‚Äôve incorporated your clarification into the KBA under the No KBA process section. Here's the adjusted final section (and I‚Äôll also embed it in the final export):

---

### üîç No KBA Available? Follow This Adjusted Procedure

If no matching KBA is available:

- Attach **KBA00099214: No KBA Available**
- Use:
  - **Request for Information (IT)** template  
  - or **Request for Information (non-IT)** template
- Add a **Work Info** note with:
  - A statement confirming *‚ÄúNo KBA Available‚Äù*
  - **At least 3 keyword searches** (to prevent oversearching)
    - More can be included **if** the issue clearly *should* have a KBA and you're trying different angles
- Set **Work Info Type** to **No KBA Available**
- Use the **Relationships tab** to ensure the KBA is properly attached

> *Agent Note:* Only 3 keyword searches are required to fulfill protocol and avoid oversearching. However, if there are several reasonable ways to phrase the issue and it clearly should have a KBA, including more keywords may help future search indexing or validation.

---

üì¶ I‚Äôll now export this as both:
- ‚úÖ **PDF**  
- ‚úÖ **DOCX**

Would you like this to include a **USDA-style header/footer** (e.g., Forest Service green bar and footer info), or would you prefer it **clean/plain** for internal editing first?

**USER**: Nah, use one of the KBAs to format it. No emojis though unless they're in official KBAs(unfortunately)

This KBA combines FS phone standards, Remedy accuracy, and emotional intelligence to help you deliver consistently excellent service.\n\nBest Practices for Positive Service Interactions\n\n1. Start Strong with the Official FS Greeting\n\u201cThank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. My name is [Your Name]. May I please have your first and last name?\u201d\nIf needed: \u201cCan you please spell that for me?\u201d or \u201cAre you calling about an existing ticket or a new request?\u201d\n\n2. Validate the Customer\u2019s Experience\nAffirm their concern right away: \u201cI understand how frustrating that must be. Let\u2019s take care of it together.\u201d\n\n3. Use the Correct Template and KBA\nIf following a KBA: Use the template specified in that KBA.\nIf no KBA is available:\n- Attach KBA00099214: No KBA Available\n- Use either Request for Information (IT) or Request for Information (non-IT) template\n- Add a Work Info note with:\n  - A statement confirming \u201cNo KBA Available\u201d\n  - At least 3 keyword searches (to prevent oversearching)\n    - More can be included if the issue clearly should have a KBA\n- Set Work Info Type to No KBA Available\n- Use the Relationships tab to ensure the KBA is properly attached\n\nAgent Note: Only 3 keyword searches are required to fulfill protocol and avoid oversearching. However, if there are several reasonable ways to phrase the issue and it clearly should have a KBA, including more keywords may help future search indexing or validation.\n\n4. Set Expectations Clearly When Routing\n\u201cSince this requires tools or access we don\u2019t have at CHD, I\u2019ll route this ticket to our Tier 2 team. They\u2019ll handle it in the order received based on their current workload.\u201d\n\n5. Ask Before Placing on Hold\n\u201cMay I please place you on hold while I look up some information to assist you?\u201d\nWhen returning: \u201cThank you for your patience.\u201d\n\n6. Speak Professionally and Warmly\nUse phrases like \u201cLet me check on that for you.\u201d and avoid saying \u201cThat\u2019s not my job.\u201d\n\n7. Close the Call Gracefully\n\u201cHave I resolved your issue today?\u201d\n\u201cYour ticket number will be sent to your email. Would you like it over the phone as well?\u201d\n\u201cThank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. Have a great day!\u201d\n\nRemedy Documentation Must Be Flawless\nYour Ticket Must Include:\n- People Record: Verify/update name, email, phone, and location\n- KBA: Attach matching KBA via USE button\n- Template: Per KBA or NKK process\n- Summary: Include system name + key issue\n- Notes: Document exact issue, behavior, and user-provided details\n- Work Detail: List steps taken and results\n- Resolution (Public): Paste fix details in Work Info and make viewable to user\n- Status/Resolution: \"Resolved\" if fixed. \"Assigned\" if routed. Reason required.\n- Owner/Group: USDA IT Service Desk + Yourself\n\nAvoidable Mistakes That Lead to Negative Feedback\n- Sounding rushed or disinterested\n- Providing inaccurate info\n- Poor or vague documentation\n- Failing to explain next steps\n- Promising outcomes beyond CHD scope\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES:\nTier 1 Solution:\nCommunicate clearly, document thoroughly, and route appropriately.\n- Resolution Method: Service Desk Assisted\n- If No KBA Available: Attach KBA00099214 and follow flow\n- Routing: Do not guarantee timelines; explain Tier 2 workflow honestly\n\nRouting Instructions:\nIf escalation is needed:\n- Route to appropriate Tier 2 group\n- Do not use \u201cFS template\u201d unless dictated by KBA\n- If NKK: Add required note, set Work Info Type, attach KBA00099214, and document searches\n\nOperational Category: Advice/How To\nProduct Category: Customer Service > Interaction\nResolution Category: How To > Soft Skills\nResolution Product Category: Service Desk Performance\nProduct Name: FS Communication Practices\n\nKEYWORDS:\nKBA12345, CHD, customer service, No KBA, FS help desk script, Tier 2 routing, Remedy templates, avoid negative feedback, communication training, NKK, KBA00099214, negative, feedback, negative feedback, avoid feedback issues, CSAT, customer satisfaction, empathy, service desk, de-escalation, hold protocol, ticket routing, service recovery\n\nOwner: Justin\nOwner Group: FS TSR Success Practices"}

**USER**: This needs to be simplified, not stated as an agent note, as well. Protocol states 3 keywords/searches must be attached, but requesting a KBA can be done as well, but not during a customer contact.

**ASSISTANT**: {

      "replacement": "Protocol requires that at least 3 keyword searches be documented when a KBA cannot be found. This ensures a sufficient search effort without oversearching.

A request to create a new KBA can be submitted, but it must be done outside of the customer contact."
    }

}

**ASSISTANT**: ‚úÖ The note has been simplified and aligned with policy. It now clearly states the protocol requirements and submission guidelines outside of live contact.

Let me know if you want that section visually separated or emphasized for quick reference.

**USER**: Escalation is different than routing and has a different protocol. We should include verbiage in this KBA and link to the KBA(at least in text, as hyperlinks will not work outside Remedy)

Suggestions before editing?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes‚Äîthis is a great moment to clarify and differentiate **routing** vs **escalation**, and help agents avoid the common mix-up. Here's my suggestion before editing:

---

### üîß Suggested Additions:

#### üü© Add a New Section: **Escalation vs. Routing**
Title: `Escalation Requests Must Follow KBA00086076 Protocol`

Proposed wording:

> **Routing** a ticket means sending it to the next appropriate support group (e.g., Tier 2) when the issue exceeds CHD tools or permissions. This is part of normal ticket handling.
>
> **Escalation**, however, is a formal process used when:
> - A ticket has been in Tier 2 with no action beyond the acceptable time limit
> - A critical/high priority issue has no contact within 2 hours
> - A low/medium priority issue has had no movement after 4 business days
>
> If a customer inquires about lack of Tier 2 response and enough time has passed, follow **KBA00086076: FS Escalation Process for Incidents** to proceed.
>
> üìå Reminder: Escalations must *never* be done during a customer call. Gather incident info and follow escalation steps separately after the call concludes.

This would also update the "Routing Instructions" section for consistency.

---

Would you like me to proceed with this edit and include a short inline reference to KBA00086076 in the Routing Instructions as well?

      "replacement": "Routing Instructions:\nIf escalation is needed:\n\n- Routing refers to sending a ticket to the appropriate support group (such as Tier 2) based on the tools or access needed to resolve the issue.\n- Escalation is a separate, formal process when a ticket has been routed but has had no response within the defined service timeframe.\n- Escalations can occur during customer contact, provided the documented criteria are met.\n- Follow the guidance in KBA00086076: FS Escalation Process for Incidents when initiating escalations.\n- Do not use the \"FS template\" unless specifically instructed by a KBA.\n- If No KBA is available: Add required note, set Work Info Type, attach KBA00099214, and document keyword searches.\n\nOperational Category:"
    }
  ]
}

**USER**: Hm? No, escalations can occur during the contact(unless stated otherwise in guidelines)

**ASSISTANT**: ‚úÖ The Routing Instructions section now clearly separates and defines **routing vs escalation**, confirms escalation can occur during the call when appropriate, and references **KBA00086076** for escalation procedures.

Let me know if you'd like to bold or box that KBA reference for higher visibility.
