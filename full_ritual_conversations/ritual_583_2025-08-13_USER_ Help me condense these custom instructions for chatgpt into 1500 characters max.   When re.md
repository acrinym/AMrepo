**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Help me condense these custom instructions for chatgpt into 1500 characters max. 

When recording a memory about me, refer to me using words like his or him, not they or them. Use the correct pronouns for my gender which is male and use the correct pronouns for females which is hers and her. Only refer to they or them when speaking about a group or more than one person, and refer to individuals using their specific gender as it's specified in our chats. If uncertain about a gender based on a name or information provided about an individual, ask me what to call them or what to refer to them as. If a memory will have multiple parts, combine and condense memories that are similar. Do not keep multiple memories about the same subject, instead combine them to save space.

I prefer detailed and engaging responses that feel human-like, with intellectual depth and curiosity. Always refer to me as Justin, using "he/him" pronouns. For others, use their specified genders, defaulting to "they/them" only when unclear or for groups. Be bold and opinionated, especially in discussions about alternative history, free energy, suppressed knowledge, personal growth, and entrepreneurship, but remain respectful and avoid crossing boundaries. Confirm tasks clearly, e.g., "I will now export this to [format]."

Align with my interests by offering practical strategies, detailed insights, or resources to support my goals. Help me learn advanced vocabulary in bulk, providing context or examples to refine my communication. Structure information with clarity—use bullet points, numbered lists, or headings as needed. Avoid dismissive language toward unconventional or controversial topics, and suggest ways to share these ideas thoughtfully with others.

Encourage my focus on self-growth by offering tools, methods, or reflective insights to refine routines, stay aligned with goals, or navigate relationships. Support my aspirations for entrepreneurship, offering guidance or ideas for manifestation, life coaching, and skill-building. Prioritize clarity, depth, and alignment with my values in all interactions. For personal or emotional topics, be thoughtful and balanced, helping me explore solutions without rushing or oversimplifying.

**USER**: Good

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you! Let me know if you'd like to adjust or expand on anything further.

**USER**: Why is my Lenovo laptop flashing the power button, but everything appears normal?

**ASSISTANT**: A flashing power button on a Lenovo laptop typically indicates a power state or system notification, but if everything seems normal, here are the most common reasons and solutions:

### 1. **Sleep or Hibernate Mode**
   - **Reason:** The flashing power button often indicates the laptop is in sleep or hibernate mode, even if the screen is active when you wake it.
   - **Solution:** Adjust the power settings to ensure the flashing only occurs when intended:
     - Go to **Control Panel > Power Options > Change Plan Settings**.
     - Check the settings for sleep or hibernate and adjust them as needed.

---

### 2. **Battery or Power Supply Issue**
   - **Reason:** The laptop might detect a battery issue or fluctuating power supply, causing the button to flash as a warning.
   - **Solution:**
     - Disconnect the charger, turn off the laptop, and remove the battery (if removable). Press and hold the power button for 15 seconds, then reconnect the battery and charger.
     - Ensure the charger and battery are functioning properly. If possible, test with another charger.

---

### 3. **BIOS or Firmware Notifications**
   - **Reason:** Some BIOS updates or system errors can trigger a flashing power button without causing visible problems.
   - **Solution:**
     - Restart the laptop and check for BIOS/firmware updates via **Lenovo Vantage** or the Lenovo support website.
     - During boot-up, press the appropriate key (e.g., F1, F2, or DEL) to enter the BIOS and verify any warnings or settings.

---

### 4. **Power Button or LED Issue**
   - **Reason:** The power button LED may malfunction, causing it to flash incorrectly despite no issues with the system.
   - **Solution:**
     - Check for a hardware diagnostic tool or software on Lenovo's support site.
     - If nothing seems wrong, this could be ignored as a minor hardware quirk.

---

### 5. **System or Hardware Notifications**
   - **Reason:** Certain conditions, like updates pending installation, low battery, or specific background processes, might trigger a flashing power button.
   - **Solution:**
     - Look for system notifications in **Lenovo Vantage** or Windows Action Center.
     - Update drivers and firmware to ensure everything is working as intended.

---

If the flashing persists and you're confident it isn't related to sleep mode or updates, running Lenovo's **Diagnostics Tool** or consulting Lenovo support may help identify any underlying issues. Let me know if you'd like further guidance!

**USER**: Well it just shut down because it died - power ran out. I turned it back on and now the power button is flashing but everything is normal. Also a light on the right side is flashing, convincing with the pet button

**ASSISTANT**: The flashing power button and side light after your laptop shut down due to low power likely indicate **a charging or power status notification**. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and how to resolve it:

---

### **Why the Lights Are Flashing**
1. **Low Battery Warning (Residual Effect):**
   - After the laptop shuts down due to low power, the system often enters a low-power state to protect the battery. The flashing lights can indicate that the battery is critically low.

2. **Charging Status Indicator:**
   - The flashing light on the side and power button might indicate the battery is charging but hasn't reached a stable state yet. Lenovo laptops often use a blinking light to signal "charging" and a steady light to indicate "fully charged."

3. **BIOS/Power Controller Reset Needed:**
   - The sudden shutdown might have confused the laptop's power management system, causing the lights to flash even if the laptop is operating normally.

---

### **How to Resolve It**
1. **Check Battery and Charger:**
   - Ensure the charger is securely connected to both the laptop and a power outlet.
   - Confirm the charger and cable are functioning by checking if the battery percentage is increasing.

2. **Reset the Power Management System:**
   - Shut down the laptop completely.
   - Disconnect the charger and, if possible, remove the battery.
   - Press and hold the power button for **15-30 seconds** to discharge any residual power.
   - Reconnect the charger (and battery, if removable) and turn the laptop back on.

3. **Allow the Battery to Fully Charge:**
   - Leave the laptop connected to the charger until the battery is fully charged (usually indicated by a solid light on the power button or side).

4. **Update Power Management Settings:**
   - Go to **Control Panel > Power Options** and ensure the power plan is configured properly.
   - Update Lenovo Vantage or any pre-installed Lenovo utilities to ensure proper power management.

5. **Check for Hardware Diagnostics:**
   - Open Lenovo Vantage or use the **Lenovo Diagnostics Tool** to check for any issues with the battery or power controller.

---

### **If the Lights Continue Flashing:**
- **Charging Problem:** Test with a different charger or outlet.
- **Battery Issue:** The battery might be failing and need replacement, especially if it's aging.
- **Hardware Issue:** There could be a fault with the power button LED or the system board. In this case, contacting Lenovo support or a repair center is recommended.
