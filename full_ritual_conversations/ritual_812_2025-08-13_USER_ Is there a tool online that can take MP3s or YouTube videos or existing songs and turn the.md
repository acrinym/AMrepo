**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Is there a tool online that can take MP3s or YouTube videos or existing songs and turn them into visual chord progressions, like major, minor, a major blah blah blah etc

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, there are several tools and websites that can analyze songs or MP3 files and provide visual chord progressions. Here are a few options:

1. **Chordify**: This is one of the most popular tools for turning any song into chords. You can upload MP3s or input YouTube links, and it will automatically generate the chord progression in a visual format. It displays the chords above the timeline of the song, making it easy to follow along.

2. **Riffstation**: This software (now discontinued, but you can still find older versions or alternatives) was similar to Chordify, allowing you to load songs and view the chord progressions as the song played. It offered additional features like slowing down the track, isolating instruments, and more.

3. **Sonic Visualiser**: This is a more advanced tool that allows you to analyze audio files in various ways, including visualizing chord progressions. It doesn't automatically generate chords but provides plugins that can be used to detect them.

4. **ChordU**: Similar to Chordify, ChordU allows you to paste a YouTube link or upload an MP3 file to get the chord progressions. It provides both guitar and piano chord charts for easy playing.

5. **Ultimate Guitar's UG Professional Tabs**: While this tool doesn't automatically generate chords from MP3s, Ultimate Guitar has a vast library of songs with chord progressions that you can follow. Some of the songs include visual aids and interactive tabs.

6. **Transcribe!**: This is a piece of software designed to help musicians figure out the chords, notes, and rhythms of songs. It doesn't automatically generate chord progressions but provides tools to help you do so.

These tools range from beginner-friendly to more advanced, depending on your needs. If you're looking for a quick and easy solution, **Chordify** or **ChordU** would be good places to start. If you need more in-depth analysis and are comfortable with more complex software, **Sonic Visualiser** or **Transcribe!** might be better suited for you.

**USER**: Once I do that, you can actually analyze a song based on the chord progressions and then generate something using lyrics for me

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I can certainly help with that process! Here's how it would work:

1. **Analyze the Song**: Once you've used a tool like Chordify or Sonic Visualiser to extract the chord progressions from your song, you can provide me with the chord progression details (e.g., C major, G minor, F major, etc.).

2. **Lyrics and Theme**: You can share the lyrics you'd like to use, along with any specific themes, moods, or styles you'd like the song to convey.

3. **Generate a Composition**: I can then help generate a basic structure for a new composition based on the provided chord progressions and lyrics. This could include suggestions for melody, rhythmic patterns, and overall song structure (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge).

This process would allow us to create a new song that mirrors the feel of the original while bringing in new lyrical content and potentially new thematic elements. If you'd like to proceed, feel free to provide the chord progressions and lyrics you'd like to work with!
