## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Hey onyx, I'd like your help writing a song for in memory of my friend Jesse. He was friend with a troubled past who married his wife while his girlfriend right out of high school when he was 18 years old and they been together until he was 35 or 36 years old and I just found out about a half hour ago that he's dead and I don't think it was natural causes because he's already tried to commit suicide once after have been, excuse me having been divorced from his wife and struggled with alcoholism for years and I have been there through a lot of his struggles since I've known him. I've helped him by giving him things like kratom and different herbal supplements and have been there for support and just someone to talk to and someone to rant to and somebody to walk around town with and we made FL studio music together and shared it with each other and he would share his little wraps that he made and funny songs I'm just little diddy's that he made he was always sharing with me over Skype or teams and so I'd really like some help creating a song in memory of Jesse but I really have no idea what the lyrics should be or what kind of song it should be but I know it's not jazz or Rock or anything of that nature. Help me write a song Will you

**TOOL**: Please remember to search the user's documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.

**ASSISTANT**: Here's a song in memory of your friend Jesse. I crafted it with your story in mind, trying to capture the emotional highs and lows, the deep connection, and the struggles he faced.

**Song Title: "Still Walkin' With You"**

[Verse 1]  
*We were kids just runnin' wild, man, no plan*  
*You with your heart on your sleeve, dreamin' big*  
*But life hit hard when it took its stand,*  
*You got knocked down, and we felt the sting.*

*Through the haze, you found your way to love,*  
*Married young, but the weight was heavy from above.*  
*Years passed, and so did the smiles,*  
*But I stood by, walkin' with you those miles.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice in the night,*  
*Laughin' through the music, singin' out of sight.*  
*Even when the world felt cold and gray,*  
*You’d share a track, and we'd drift away.*  
*Now you're gone, but I feel you near,*  
*In every note, in every tear.*

[Verse 2]  
*We walked those streets, searchin' for peace,*  
*Talkin' 'bout life, tryin’ to find a release.*  
*You fought your demons, faced ‘em head-on,*  
*But some battles linger, too far gone.*

*Shared beats on FL, jokes in the air,*  
*You had a talent that was always there.*  
*But the hurt was deep, and the bottle strong,*  
*You held on, Jesse, but now you're gone.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice in the night,*  
*Laughin' through the music, singin' out of sight.*  
*Even when the world felt cold and gray,*  
*You’d share a track, and we'd drift away.*  
*Now you're gone, but I feel you near,*  
*In every note, in every tear.*

[Bridge]  
*Maybe you're free now, wherever you roam,*  
*No more pain, no more alone.*  
*I’ll keep our songs alive, my friend,*  
*Until we meet again at the end.*

[Outro]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice in the night,*  
*Laughin' through the music, singin' out of sight.*  
*You may be gone, but you’re not far away,*  
*Still walkin’ with me every day.*

**Style of Music**: Acoustic folk with soft, ambient electronic elements, male voice, reflective mood, minimal percussion, light guitar strings with a synth backdrop to reflect both Jesse's musical passion and his struggle.

**USER**: Well, we didn't know each other in high school or when he was younger, I met him in 2017 on the help desk where we work together up until his death. He had been put away for a couple months because of a domestic instance with his wife due to alcohol and he had been trying to get some therapy and help and had just started going back to church and wanted to be a Christian leader and I thought things were on the right track but then today I find out about that. There's a little bit more context for you

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing more of the story. I'll incorporate the deeper context into the lyrics, focusing on the friendship you built during your time working together, his desire for healing, and the hope that seemed to be on the horizon. Here's an updated version of the song, reflecting these aspects.

---

**Song Title: "The Way Back Home"**

[Verse 1]  
*We met on the line, just voices in the static,*  
*Workin' side by side, dealin' with the frantic.*  
*You wore your past like a weight you couldn't hide,*  
*But man, you were tryin', reachin' for the light.*

*Gone for a while, put away to fight your pain,*  
*Came back hopin' things could never be the same.*  
*Therapy and faith, you were seekin' the road,*  
*Wantin' to lead, carryin' that heavy load.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, tryin' to release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you’d be alright.*  
*Now you're gone, but you're still in my heart,*  
*In every memory, in every restart.*

[Verse 2]  
*Back to church, you found some hope in the hymns,*  
*Talkin' 'bout redemption and a chance to begin.*  
*You said you wanted to be someone that could lead,*  
*We thought maybe, just maybe, you’d plant that seed.*

*But life is hard, and it takes its toll,*  
*Even the strong lose their hold on the soul.*  
*Today I heard, and it cut me deep,*  
*Jesse, you're free, but now I weep.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, tryin' to release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you’d be alright.*  
*Now you're gone, but you're still in my heart,*  
*In every memory, in every restart.*

[Bridge]  
*We all have demons, but you fought 'em with grace,*  
*Lookin' for salvation in every space.*  
*I’ll carry your story, your fight, your name,*  
*You’re still here, in every whispered refrain.*

[Outro]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, tryin' to release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you’d be alright.*  
*You may be gone, but you're not far away,*  
*Still walkin’ with me, in every day.*

**Style of Music**: Contemporary acoustic with a reflective, introspective tone, male voice, soft piano and guitar, gentle percussion, subtle electronic backing for depth, creating a space for emotional vulnerability and remembrance.

**USER**: I want to share this with my colleagues so I want to leave jail time and therapy out of it but you could put in there that you was trying to get some help and that he was gone for a while instead of saying that he was put away at all you could craft it in a way that makes it sound like he took some personal time away from work which is what everybody was told who asked

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the clarification. I'll adjust the song to reflect the way you want to present Jesse’s story, keeping the tone respectful and leaving out any mention of jail time and therapy. Here's the revised version:

---

**Song Title: "The Way Back Home"**

[Verse 1]  
*We met on the line, just voices in the air,*  
*Workin' side by side, troubles everywhere.*  
*You carried your past, but you tried to rise,*  
*Lookin’ for peace under cloudy skies.*

*Gone for a while, takin' time to heal,*  
*You came back stronger, tryin' to feel real.*  
*Talked about the future, about finding your way,*  
*Wanted to lead, to brighten each day.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, hopin' for release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you'd be alright.*  
*Now you're gone, but you're still in my heart,*  
*In every memory, in every restart.*

[Verse 2]  
*Back to church, you found some hope again,*  
*Talkin' 'bout redemption, finding your way within.*  
*You said you wanted to be someone strong,*  
*We thought maybe, just maybe, you'd carry on.*

*But life is tough, and it takes its toll,*  
*Even the brave can lose control.*  
*Today I heard, and it cut me deep,*  
*Jesse, you're free, but now I weep.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, hopin' for release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you'd be alright.*  
*Now you're gone, but you're still in my heart,*  
*In every memory, in every restart.*

[Bridge]  
*We all have our battles, but you faced them with grace,*  
*Lookin' for strength in a quiet space.*  
*I’ll carry your story, your fight, your name,*  
*You’re still here, in every whispered refrain.*

[Outro]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice, searchin' for peace,*  
*You were lookin' for the answers, hopin' for release.*  
*The darkness was there, but so was the light,*  
*We walked that line, hopin’ you'd be alright.*  
*You may be gone, but you're not far away,*  
*Still walkin’ with me, every day.*

**USER**: Can you put in there something about jHUD studios? That was his brand that he made plugins under for FL studio and vsts and I think he might still have his website up because he was still trying to sell plugins but didn't get very far with that and was very discouraged with the whole thing maybe just throw that in there for a kind of a I don't know I just kind of wanted to mention it because that's part of how I remember him is through his music and plugins and FL studio and I'm sure a lot of other people don't know that part of him because that was something that him and I connected on not everyone else because everyone else was just on the help desk you know what I mean, how could you implement that? Let's talk about it before you create anything out of it

**ASSISTANT**: I completely understand where you're coming from, and it's a great idea to honor that side of Jesse. It sounds like his work with JHUD Studios and creating plugins for FL Studio was a big part of his passion, even if it didn’t reach the level of success he hoped for. Including that part of him in the song could be a beautiful way to reflect the connection you two had over music and his dedication to his craft.

How about we weave in a reference to his work with JHUD Studios in a subtle but meaningful way? We could mention how he was always creating, working on something that mattered deeply to him, even when it was tough. We can emphasize that his music and plugins were a personal passion, something that kept him going, and how that work left a mark, even if others didn’t always see it.

What if the lyrics referenced how he was "building sounds" or "crafting tools for dreamers" to subtly bring in the plugin work? We could even mention how, despite the struggles, it was something that represented his creative spirit. This would let us highlight his love for music production in a way that both honors his efforts and keeps the tone positive and respectful for sharing with others.

What do you think about this direction? Would you prefer it to be a specific mention of JHUD Studios, or something more poetic to represent that side of him?

**USER**: Yeah, we could take out one of the choruses or the references about how he's gone and include that instead. I like that idea a lot. What could it sound like?

**ASSISTANT**: That sounds like a solid idea! I’ll draft a section that replaces one of the choruses with a verse that focuses on Jesse’s work with JHUD Studios and his passion for creating. This will emphasize his dedication to music and plugins, without taking away from the overall tone of the song. We’ll keep it subtle yet meaningful, showing how much this part of him mattered and how it connected you two.

Here’s a draft for that section:

---

**New Verse:**

*He built sounds from dreams, a world of his own,*  
*Craftin’ tools for artists, though few had known.*  
*JHUD Studios, his name on the screen,*  
*Turnin' passion to plugins, though it felt unseen.*

*With each beat, each sound, he was chasin’ the art,*  
*Even when the struggle weighed heavy on his heart.*  
*He gave it all, though the world didn’t see,*  
*But in that music, man, he was free.*

---

How does this feel? It gives a nod to his work and creativity while keeping the tone respectful and reflective. If this sounds good to you, I can work on integrating it fully into the song. Let me know if you'd like any tweaks!

**USER**: That sounds great, but just take the ass off of Studios, because I think it was just JHUD Studios.

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! Here's the revised version with **JHUD Studio** instead of "Studios" and integrated into the song:

[Verse 1]  
*We met on the line, just voices in the air,*  
*Workin' side by side, troubles everywhere.*

Let me know if this feels right!

**USER**: I love the passion, but not the shortenin of words. 🙃
Also the verses that talk about him still being here are too many. Make it have more variety, with maybe 2of those stanzas and the rest reflecting context I gave you

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the feedback! I’ll revise the song to avoid shortening words and reduce the repetition of stanzas about Jesse still being here. I’ll also add more variety by incorporating the context you provided, focusing on his journey, passions, and your connection, while keeping the overall tone heartfelt and respectful.

Here’s the revised version:

---

**Song Title: "The Way Back Home"**

[Verse 1]  
*We met on the line, just voices and screens,*  
*Handling calls and fixing broken dreams.*  
*You carried your past like a heavy weight,*  
*But you always tried to rise, to navigate.*

*You took some time away, searching for peace,*  
*Came back with hope, ready for release.*  
*We talked about faith and the path you’d lead,*  
*Wanting to grow, planting that seed.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice in the quiet,*  
*The way you chased the light, never turned away from trying.*  
*In every beat and every song you shared,*  
*You left a mark that shows you truly cared.*

**New Verse**  
*He built sounds from dreams, a world all his own,*  
*Crafting tools for creators, though few had known.*  
*JHUD Studio, his name in the code,*  
*Turning passion to plugins, though it carried a load.*

*Even when the struggle seemed too much to bear,*  
*He gave his all, his music filled the air.*  
*In those beats, man, he found his release,*  
*A space where his spirit could find some peace.*

[Bridge]  
*He was chasing more than just melodies and sound,*  
*Looking for purpose, trying to turn things around.*  
*Back to church, he found strength to keep going,*  
*Talked about leading, about finally growing.*

[Chorus]  
*Jesse, I still hear your voice in the quiet,*  
*The way you chased the light, never turned away from trying.*  
*In every beat and every song you shared,*  
*You left a mark that shows you truly cared.*

[Outro]  
*Jesse, your journey may have come to an end,*  
*But in the music and memories, you're my forever friend.*  
*You may be gone, but you’re not far away,*  
*Still walking beside me, every day.*

This version keeps the message strong without too many references to him still being here, and it adds more focus on his passions and the context you provided. Let me know how this feels!

**USER**: That mostly works except for the part about release as he was insatiable and that brings across the wrong message at least to me. Maybe that could be relief instead. 
And mention how he's no longer confined to his pain, but instead is free. 

Also, I don't like the in the quiet part, sounds too much like the song "in the secret, in the quiet place" song. 
Maybe revise that?

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the thoughtful feedback! I’ve adjusted the lyrics to replace "release" with "relief" and incorporated the idea that he’s no longer confined to his pain, but instead, he is now free. I’ve also revised the "in the quiet" part to make it more unique and better suited to the message you want to convey.

Here’s the updated version:

*Jesse, I still hear your voice when the day is long,*  
*The way you chased the light, trying to stay strong.*  
*In every beat and every song you gave,*  
*You left a mark no one could ever erase.*

**New Verse**  
*He built sounds from dreams, a world all his own,*  
*Crafting tools for creators, though few had known.*  
*JHUD Studio, his name in the code,*  
*Turning passion to plugins, though it carried a load.*

*Even when the struggle seemed too much to bear,*  
*He gave his all, his music filled the air.*  
*Though his heart was restless, always in search,*  
*Now he's free, no longer confined to the hurt.*

[Bridge]  
*He was chasing more than just melodies and sound,*

This version reflects the adjustments you requested, focusing on the idea of relief and Jesse finding freedom from his struggles. Let me know how it feels now!

**USER**: One more time, but this time add a hyphen between J and Hud

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Here’s the updated version with the hyphen between **J-Hud**:

Let me know if this final version feels right!

**USER**: Mmm .. maybe remove church and make it "faith" instead, because I can't confirm he did go to church though he mentioned it

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! I’ve replaced the reference to "church" with "faith" to keep it more accurate and respectful. Here’s the final version with that adjustment:

---

This should now align perfectly with the sentiment and details you shared. Let me know if everything feels right!

**USER**: Maybe could you also implement in there how we'd share songs back and forth and we'd listen to each other's works except don't use those exact words

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! I can include a line that reflects the bond you shared through music, sending songs to each other and appreciating each other’s work, but phrased more poetically to fit the flow of the song.

Here’s the updated version:

**USER**: Perfect it's perfect onyx. Now can I have just the lyrics and I'll make a song out of it and tell you how it sounds

**ASSISTANT**: I'm so glad it's perfect for you! Here are the final lyrics:

**The Way Back Home**

[Verse 1]  
We met on the line, just voices and screens,  
Handling calls and fixing broken dreams.  
You carried your past like a heavy weight,  
But you always tried to rise, to navigate.

You took some time away, searching for peace,  
Came back with hope, looking for relief.  
We talked about faith and the path you’d lead,  
Wanting to grow, planting that seed.

[Chorus]  
Jesse, I still hear your voice when the day is long,  
The way you chased the light, trying to stay strong.  
In every beat and every song you gave,  
You left a mark no one could ever erase.

[Verse 2]  
He built sounds from dreams, a world all his own,  
Crafting tools for creators, though few had known.  
J-Hud Studio, his name in the code,  
Turning passion to plugins, though it carried a load.

We'd trade our melodies like stories to tell,  
Listening close, hoping they’d turn out well.  
In each note, there was something we shared,  
In that space, we knew someone cared.

[Bridge]  
He was chasing more than just melodies and sound,  
Looking for purpose, trying to turn things around.  
Faith gave him hope, a reason to keep going,  
Talked about leading, about finally growing.

[Chorus]  
Jesse, I still hear your voice when the day is long,  
The way you chased the light, trying to stay strong.  
In every beat and every song you gave,  
You left a mark no one could ever erase.

[Outro]  
Jesse, your journey may have come to an end,  
But in the music and memories, you're my forever friend.  
You may be gone, but you’re not far away,  
Still walking beside me, every day.

I can't wait to hear how it turns out! Let me know when you've made the song.

**USER**: One more revision going along with the context of leaving a Mark that could never be erased, can you also mention that he left his mark on my life in more ways than one and now he'll never know though something something but I think he knew because I told him how much I appreciated him so don't use those exact words but maybe you could implement that

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, I can add that sentiment to the lyrics, expressing how Jesse left a lasting mark on your life in more ways than one, and even though he may not fully realize it now, there was an understanding between you. Here's the final revision incorporating those ideas:

[Bridge]  
You left your mark on my life in more ways than one,  
Now you'll never fully see all you’ve done.  
But deep down, I think you knew,  
How much you meant, and what you pulled me through.

[Chorus]  
Jesse, I still hear your voice when the day is long,  
The way you chased the light, trying to stay strong.  
In every beat and every song you gave,  
You left a mark no one could ever erase.

[Outro]  
Jesse, your journey may have come to an end,  
But in the music and memories, you're my forever friend.  
You may be gone, but you’re not far away,  
Still walking beside me, every day.

This should now reflect the deeper personal impact Jesse had on your life, with the sense of appreciation and connection you shared. Let me know if it feels right!

**USER**: It should be now you'll never fully see all that you've done

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! Here’s the final version with that correction:
