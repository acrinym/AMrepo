**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Is it possible to create a gui windows explorer-lookalike that functions similar to explorer (from, let's say windows 7) using powershell and windows forms, WMI, cmd, etc? 
Same/similar buttons/graphics/icons and also include a start menu? We would pull program file icons from installed programs in %programfiles% and %programfilesx86% (substituting the correct syntax there. 
Also, we could include a list of system tools that are already on the win10/11 start menu using existing commands, or write new ones. 

What do you think? When Windows starts, it would call the script that starts the gui-powershell-script that simulates windows explorer and it's functionality.

**TOOL**: **Crafting a GUI in PowerShell**

I'm working through designing a PowerShell GUI that mirrors Windows Explorer, considering System.Windows.Forms or WPF and relying on shell32 and third-party libraries.

**ASSISTANT**: Hi Justin,

Conceptually, yes—what you’re describing sounds like a shell replacement project, and it’s certainly possible at a high level. But the devil is in the details, and there are quite a few hurdles to overcome if you want it to truly mimic the look, feel, and functionality of Windows Explorer.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Recreating Windows Explorer’s UI:**  
   Technically, you can build a GUI using PowerShell with WinForms or even WPF to approximate the layout of Windows Explorer: a tree view for directories on the left, a list view (with icons and details) for files on the right, and maybe some top-level toolbar buttons. You’d rely heavily on:
   - **PowerShell + .NET Classes:** Use `System.Windows.Forms` or `System.Windows.Controls` (for WPF) to create the interface elements.
   - **Icon Extraction:** For icons, you could extract icons from `.exe` or `.dll` files (e.g. `shell32.dll`) using .NET calls. For installed programs, you’d enumerate `%ProgramFiles%` and `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` (or the correct variables `($env:ProgramFiles)` and `($env:ProgramFiles(x86))`) and pull icons from their executables.
   
   However, perfectly matching Windows Explorer’s aesthetics is tricky. The native Explorer uses Windows Shell APIs internally and integrates with the OS’s theming, which isn’t trivial to replicate. While you can get fairly close, it’ll have the feel of a third-party app rather than a pixel-perfect copy.

2. **Navigational and Shell Functionality:**  
   Explorer isn’t just a file list; it’s deeply integrated into the OS through the Windows Shell API. Actions like:
   - Right-click context menus (shell context handlers).
   - Extended properties on files and folders.
   - Shell namespace extensions.  
   
   These would be challenging to replicate fully. You can approximate them by manually coding menu items, calling `Get-ChildItem` for directory listing, `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item` for file operations, and hooking into file associations using registry lookups. But the complexity ramps up quickly if you want that full “Explorer-like” experience.

3. **Start Menu Simulation:**  
   A Start Menu simulation could be done by:
   - Building a panel that pops up (like a form that shows/hides on button click).
   - Populating it with shortcuts from known start menu locations (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` and the user’s Start Menu folder).
   - Extracting icons from the shortcuts’ targets.
   
   This is doable with PowerShell and WPF/WinForms, but again, visually and behaviorally it won’t be a perfect clone. You can list system tools found by enumerating directories, or even run `Get-StartApps` in newer Windows builds, although its reliability varies. You can also custom-build a static list of commands or dynamically generate them.

4. **Replacing the Shell at Startup:**  
   If you truly want to replace `explorer.exe` as the Windows shell, you can edit registry keys to run your PowerShell script at login instead of Explorer. For example, changing the `Shell` value in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` (or via a policy) to point to a PowerShell script or a compiled WinForms/WPF executable.  
   
   But be aware:
   - Shell replacements can cause stability issues if not done carefully.
   - You’d lose a lot of built-in Windows functionality that Explorer provides.
   - Maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting this environment could be a headache.

5. **Performance and Stability:**  
   PowerShell with WinForms can handle simple UIs, but a full-featured Explorer clone is complex. Performance might lag compared to the native shell. You’d need to test thoroughly and optimize.

**In Summary:**  
Yes, in theory you can do this. Using PowerShell and .NET, you can create a functional GUI that looks somewhat like Windows Explorer, complete with icons, navigation panes, and a rudimentary start menu panel. You can run it at startup and use it as a shell replacement. But you must temper your expectations:

- **It won’t be a perfect clone:** You’ll get a rough approximation rather than a pixel-perfect, functionally identical Explorer.
- **Significant coding effort:** You’d essentially be writing a custom shell environment from scratch.  
- **Maintenance & Complexity:** As Windows evolves, your custom shell may break or behave unexpectedly.

If you’re doing this as a proof-of-concept or a fun experiment, it’s a neat challenge. If you’re aiming for a stable, production-ready Explorer replacement, it may be more work than it’s worth.

**USER**: We could also call installed program files directly from the registry, and implement icons also called from there. That might be more helpful than scanning progra~1 or progra~2.

**TOOL**: **Mapping program sources**

OK, let me see. The registry can pinpoint installed programs and icons via specific keys and paths, and shortcuts for start menu entries provide another data source.

**ASSISTANT**: Hi Justin,

That’s definitely a more structured approach. The Windows registry stores a lot of information about installed programs, especially under keys like `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` and its WOW64 counterpart at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`. Each subkey typically includes values like `DisplayName`, `DisplayIcon`, and `InstallLocation` which you can tap into. This would cut down on the guesswork compared to just enumerating `%ProgramFiles%` or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`.

**Benefits of Using the Registry:**

1. **Structured Data for Installed Programs:**  
   Instead of scanning directories for executables (which can be messy and can include unrelated `.exe` files), these registry keys give you a curated list of “officially” installed programs. You can filter out items that don’t have a `DisplayName` or are otherwise not relevant. This makes it easier to create a more “clean” Start Menu equivalent, just showing recognized apps.

2. **Direct Access to Icons:**  
   Many `DisplayIcon` entries provide a direct path to an executable or a `.ico` file. You can parse these paths from PowerShell, then use .NET methods like `[System.Drawing.Icon]::ExtractAssociatedIcon($exePath)` or more robust icon extraction methods to get the icons. This avoids brute forcing icons by scanning `shell32.dll` or `imageres.dll` unless you specifically want default system icons.

3. **Consistent Metadata:**  
   The registry entries often have other metadata fields, like publisher name, version, estimated size, etc., which can be displayed in a tooltip or application details pane. This can make your “Start Menu” feel more integrated and informative rather than a basic shortcut list.

**Implementation Details:**

- **PowerShell Registry Access:**  
  You can use `Get-ItemProperty` or `Get-ChildItem` commands on `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*` to enumerate installed apps. For each, read out `DisplayName`, `DisplayIcon`, `InstallLocation`, etc.
  
  Example snippet:
  ```powershell
  $uninstallKey = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"
  Get-ChildItem $uninstallKey | ForEach-Object {
      $app = Get-ItemProperty $_.PSPath
      if ($app.DisplayName) {
          [PSCustomObject]@{
              Name  = $app.DisplayName
              Icon  = $app.DisplayIcon
              Path  = $app.InstallLocation
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Of course, you’ll likely want to handle cases where `DisplayIcon` might just be an `.exe` with `,0` appended to indicate a specific icon resource index.

- **Creating Your Start Menu UI:**  
  With this data in hand, you can populate a list or a panel in your WinForms/WPF GUI. Each entry could be shown with a thumbnail of the icon and the display name beneath it. Clicking it would run the associated `Path` or `DisplayIcon` target. If you’re building a Start Menu panel, you might also categorize or filter these programs for neatness (group by publisher, for instance).

- **Fallback Approaches:**  
  For system tools that aren’t in the uninstall list, you can still rely on known directories or well-documented registry keys. For example, certain admin tools or MMC snap-ins can be enumerated by known paths. Or you might access system shortcuts in `C:\Windows\System32` or the Start Menu folder itself. If something isn’t registered under `Uninstall` keys (like built-in Windows components), you can supplement with a custom curated list or a scan of the built-in Start Menu directories:
  ```powershell
  $CommonStartMenu = $env:ProgramData + "\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
  $UserStartMenu = $env:AppData + "\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
  ```

**In Summary:**  
Relying on registry data for installed programs gives you a more curated list and direct icon references, reducing the need for brute-force scanning of program directories. This approach is cleaner, more efficient, and leads to a more stable and “official” set of program entries. Combining this registry-based data gathering with a well-designed GUI will help your custom shell or Explorer-like interface feel more integrated and useful.

**USER**: Let's do that - scan the built-in start menu and recreate that list for system/built in tools. 
For each newly installed program/app, powershell could be called to reimplement that in the new gui shell. 
Read the properties for the executable and uninstall string, also provided by the registry.

**TOOL**: **Crafting a dynamic UI shell**

I'm pulling together a script to scan and update a UI shell from the start menu, leveraging known directories and WMI events for efficient re-scanning and registry monitoring.

**ASSISTANT**: Hi Justin,

Absolutely, that’s a solid approach. By scanning the built-in Start Menu directories, you can enumerate system shortcuts—these often map to built-in utilities, admin tools, and other system-provided applications. Meanwhile, for newly installed apps, you can run a re-scan of the registry’s uninstall keys and apply the same logic to add them to your GUI. This creates a workflow somewhat similar to how the native Start Menu updates when new applications are installed.

**Step-by-Step Outline:**

1. **Enumerate System Tools from the Built-In Start Menu:**  
   - The common Start Menu directory is typically:  
     `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`
   - The user-specific Start Menu directory is typically:  
     `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`
   
   By enumerating `.lnk` (shortcut) files in these directories, you can extract their target paths, icons, and friendly names. System tools like “Command Prompt”, “Windows Administrative Tools”, “Control Panel”, etc. appear here.

2. **Extract Shortcut Information:**  
   Using PowerShell, you can utilize the `Windows Script Host` COM object (`WScript.Shell`) to resolve `.lnk` files and extract their target paths, working directories, and icons. For example:
   ```powershell
   $Shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
   $shortcut = $Shell.CreateShortcut("C:\Path\To\Shortcut.lnk")

   # Properties available
   $targetPath = $shortcut.TargetPath
   $iconPath   = $shortcut.IconLocation
   $arguments  = $shortcut.Arguments
   $description = $shortcut.Description
   ```
   
   With this info, you can display these tools in your custom GUI’s “Start Menu” panel. For icons, you’d still use .NET classes to extract them from `$iconPath`.

3. **Enumerate Newly Installed Programs from the Registry:**  
   As discussed, registry keys under:
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`
   
   contain `DisplayName`, `DisplayIcon`, and `UninstallString`. When a new program is installed, these keys are updated. By periodically rescanning these keys, or rescanning on-demand (like adding a "Refresh" button to your custom shell), you can discover newly installed apps and update your GUI accordingly.

   Example snippet:
   ```powershell
   $uninstallKeys = @(
     "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*",
     "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*"
   )

   $installedApps = foreach ($keyPath in $uninstallKeys) {
       Get-ChildItem $keyPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object {
           $app = Get-ItemProperty $_.PSPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
           if ($app.DisplayName -and $app.DisplayIcon) {
               [PSCustomObject]@{
                   Name          = $app.DisplayName
                   Icon          = $app.DisplayIcon
                   InstallPath   = $app.InstallLocation
                   UninstallCmd  = $app.UninstallString
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Then you can integrate these entries into your GUI, each with its name, icon (extracted from `$app.DisplayIcon`), and some action to launch the program.

4. **Refresh Mechanism for Newly Installed Apps:**  
   You have a couple of options:
   - **Manual Refresh:** Provide a “Refresh” button in your custom shell’s Start Menu panel to re-run the registry scan and update the UI.
   - **Event-Driven Updates:** You could, in theory, use WMI or the Windows Registry Change notifications to detect changes in those registry keys and trigger an update. That’s more advanced but would lead to a more dynamic system.

5. **Integrating and Displaying the Data in the GUI:**  
   Using WinForms or WPF, you can populate a list, grid, or tile panel with the gathered data:
   - For the system/built-in tools: use the extracted shortcuts from the Start Menu directories.
   - For installed apps: use the registry-based data.
   
   Add each item to your custom Start panel with its icon and name. When clicked, call `Start-Process` on its executable target (for shortcuts) or `Start-Process` on `$app.InstallPath` or `$app.DisplayIcon` for installed apps.  
   
   Example of launching an app after user clicks a button:
   ```powershell
   $launchButton.Add_Click({
       Start-Process $installedApp.InstallPath
   })
   ```

6. **Enhancing the Experience:**  
   - **Filtering or Categorization:** Group system tools and installed applications into categories or show them all in a scrolling panel.
   - **Search Bar:** Implement a textbox for searching through the available shortcuts and apps.
   - **Error Handling & Fallbacks:** Some registry entries may not have a valid `InstallLocation` or `DisplayIcon`. Fall back to a default icon if needed.

**Putting It All Together:**  
In practice, the main complexity lies in building a cohesive and attractive UI. The actual enumeration of system tools and installed programs is quite straightforward with PowerShell. Once you’ve got the data, populating it into a Start Menu-like panel in your custom GUI shell involves just looping through the collected objects and dynamically creating controls.

This layered approach—system tools from Start Menu directories plus user-installed apps from registry scans—results in a dynamic, consistently updated application listing that mirrors the functionality of the original Windows Start Menu. Once you hook this into your PowerShell-based shell that replaces Explorer, you’ll have a self-maintaining environment that updates as new software is installed or removed.

**USER**: So let's do it! It might not look good, but at least it'll work. :) 

Just recreate a start menu at the bottom left and the current time on the bottom right. 

Current running tasks can be managed using task manager(as a last resort), but preferably natively using powershell, and WMI, and shut down using taskkill

**ASSISTANT**: Hi Justin,

Exactly, function over form to start with—no need for a fancy look right away. You can focus on the fundamental logic first and then improve the aesthetics later. Below is a rough conceptual outline of how you might achieve a minimal custom “shell” with a Start Menu button at the bottom left, a system tray area with current time at the bottom right, and a rudimentary “tasks” list that lets you terminate processes. You’d launch this script at login after replacing Explorer as the shell in the registry. Over time, you can refine the UI, add icons, and more functionality.

**High-Level Steps:**

1. **Create the Main Form (Main Window)**  
   - Form is maximized to cover the desktop background (or sized as you like).
   - Form border and title set to none, making it look like a desktop.
   - Add a panel or status strip at the bottom to act like a taskbar.

2. **Start Menu Button (Bottom Left)**  
   - A simple button in the bottom-left corner that, when clicked, toggles a Start Menu panel.
   - The Start Menu panel is another panel that appears above the bottom panel, listing apps.

3. **Current Time (Bottom Right)**  
   - A label or a status label on the bottom right that updates every 30 seconds or so using a timer, showing the current system time (like `Get-Date`).

4. **Enumerate System Tools & Installed Apps**  
   - On loading the form, run a function to scan the Start Menu directories for `.lnk` files and display these in the Start panel.
   - Run a registry scan to get installed apps and also display them in the Start panel.
   - Each item in the Start panel can be a button or clickable label that launches the target program.

5. **Task Management**  
   - Another panel or a separate “task list” panel triggered by a button on the “taskbar.”
   - Enumerate running processes with `Get-Process`, show them in a list. Selecting one and pressing a “Kill” button will call `Stop-Process -Id <pid>` or `taskkill.exe /PID <pid>`.

**Example Code Sketch (WinForms in PowerShell)**

*Note:* The code below is a conceptual example. It won’t be pixel-perfect or production-ready. You’ll likely need to tweak namespaces, event handlers, and layout logic. Run in Windows PowerShell with `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms, System.Drawing` before the GUI code. Also, ensure you are running in a STA mode (e.g., `powershell.exe -STA`).

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing

function Get-InstalledApps {
    $uninstallKeys = @(
        "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*",
        "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*"
    )

    $installedApps = foreach ($keyPath in $uninstallKeys) {
        Get-ChildItem $keyPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object {
            $app = Get-ItemProperty $_.PSPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
            if ($app.DisplayName -and $app.DisplayIcon) {
                [PSCustomObject]@{
                    Name          = $app.DisplayName
                    IconPath      = $app.DisplayIcon
                    InstallPath   = $app.InstallLocation
                    LaunchCommand = if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($app.InstallLocation)) {
                        # If no InstallLocation, try DisplayIcon or UninstallString logic
                        $app.DisplayIcon.Split(",")[0]
                    } else {
                        $app.InstallLocation

- The Start button toggles visibility of a Start Menu panel listing installed apps (from registry) and shortcuts (from Start Menu folders).
- Clicking on any listed app launches it via `Start-Process`.
- The “Tasks” button shows a panel listing running processes, allowing you to kill them.
- A timer updates the clock every second.

**Next Steps & Improvements:**

- Add icons to the app buttons by extracting icons from `IconPath`.
- Make the Start Menu panel scrollable or more polished in layout.
- Implement better error handling and stability checks.
- Consider using WPF for a more modern and flexible UI.
- Add a shutdown/restart option by calling `Stop-Computer` or similar commands.

As you said, it might not look great at first, but it will work and demonstrate the core logic of a rudimentary shell replacement with a Start Menu, clock, and task management capabilities. Over time, you can refine the layout and integrate additional Windows Shell calls, icons, and styling.
