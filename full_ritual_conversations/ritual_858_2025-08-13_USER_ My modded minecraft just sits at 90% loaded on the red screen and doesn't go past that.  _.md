**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: My modded minecraft just sits at 90% loaded on the red screen and doesn't go past that.

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, the ol' 90% stall on a modded Minecraft load screen. Let's dive into some troubleshooting to get ya back to mining and crafting in no time!

1. **Check for Mod Conflicts**:
   - Disable all mods and then re-enable them one by one. This way, you can pinpoint which mod is causing the issue.
   - Ensure all mods are compatible with your Minecraft version.

2. **Update Mods and Forge**:
   - Make sure you have the latest version of Forge installed.
   - Update all your mods to their latest versions.

3. **Increase RAM Allocation**:
   - Go to your Minecraft launcher settings.
   - Increase the amount of RAM allocated to Minecraft (usually, 4-8 GB is good, depending on your system specs).

4. **Check Logs for Errors**:
   - Open the Minecraft launcher and go to the “Logs” tab.
   - Look for any error messages or warnings that could point to the problem.

5. **Delete Config Folder**:
   - Sometimes, old configuration files can cause issues. Delete the `config` folder in your `.minecraft` directory (make a backup first, just in case).

6. **Reinstall Minecraft and Forge**:
   - If all else fails, try a clean reinstall of Minecraft and Forge. Make sure to back up your saves and mods first.

7. **Check Java Version**:
   - Ensure you’re running the correct version of Java that is compatible with your mods and Minecraft version. Sometimes updating Java can resolve these issues.

If you're still stuck after trying these steps, lemme know what mods you're using and any specific errors from your logs, and we can dig deeper!

**ASSISTANT**: Oh no, stuck at 90%? That's like waiting for coffee to brew and the machine just stops! Let's get you back in the game. Here’s a sassy lil’ troubleshooting checklist to help you out:

1. **Check the Mods**: Sometimes mods just don’t play nice with each other.
   - Make sure all your mods are compatible with the version of Minecraft you’re running.
   - Disable a few mods at a time to see if one of them is causing the issue.

2. **Allocate More RAM**: Minecraft is a hungry beast.
   - Go to your Minecraft Launcher, click on "Installations," select your modded profile, then "More Options," and increase the RAM allocation in the JVM Arguments. Try bumping it up a bit but don’t go overboard.

3. **Update Everything**: Keep it fresh!
   - Ensure your Forge (or whatever mod loader you’re using) is up to date.
   - Make sure Java is updated to the latest version.

4. **Check for Conflicts**: Mods sometimes overlap in functionality.
   - Review the mod descriptions to ensure there aren’t any known conflicts.
   - Use a tool like **Mod Organizer** to spot conflicts.

5. **Error Logs Are Your Friend**: They spill the beans on what’s wrong.
   - Go to your `.minecraft` folder, find the `logs` directory, and check the latest log file. Look for any red flags (errors) near the end of the file.
   - You can share the log file with a community or forum for more specific advice.

6. **Reinstall Mods**: A fresh start can sometimes work wonders.
   - Delete and re-download the mods from a reliable source.

7. **Try a Different Profile**: Maybe it’s your current setup.
   - Create a new mod profile and add mods one by one to see if you can pinpoint the problem.

8. **Seek Community Help**: When in doubt, ask the crowd!
   - Check out Minecraft forums, Discord servers, or Reddit for similar issues and solutions.

If you need more detailed steps or help interpreting those error logs, just holler! We’ll get you back to building and crafting in no time.

**USER**: What minecraft mod shows the preloader happening and what it's doing?

And crash.

**ASSISTANT**: It looks like the issue is related to the `advanced_runtime_resource_pack` and possibly a conflict with the `loading-window` mod, particularly with mixins targeting `org.lwjgl.glfw.GLFW`. Here's a detailed troubleshooting guide to help you resolve this:

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. **Update Mods and Fabric Loader**:
   - Ensure you have the latest versions of all your mods and the Fabric Loader. Sometimes, simply updating can resolve compatibility issues.

2. **Check Mod Compatibility**:
   - Verify that all your mods are compatible with each other and with the version of Minecraft you are running.

3. **Remove the Problematic Mod**:
   - Temporarily remove the `advanced_runtime_resource_pack` mod and try launching Minecraft again to see if the issue persists. If it does, try removing the `loading-window` mod as well.

4. **Check for Dependency Issues**:
   - Some mods require specific libraries or other mods to function correctly. Ensure that all dependencies are installed.

5. **Adjust Mod Load Order**:
   - Sometimes changing the order in which mods are loaded can resolve conflicts. You can use a mod manager like MultiMC to adjust the load order.

6. **Review and Edit Config Files**:
   - Some mods allow you to disable specific features or mixins that might be causing issues. Check the configuration files for the mods in question and see if you can disable problematic parts.

### Example Configuration Adjustment:

For the `loading-window` mod, you might find a configuration file where you can disable the mixin targeting `org.lwjgl.glfw.GLFW`. Here’s an example path where you might find such a file:

- `.minecraft/config/loading-window.toml` (or similar)

Open the file and look for settings related to GLFW or mixins and see if there’s an option to disable it.

### Community Help:

If the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider seeking help from the modding community:

- **Minecraft Forum or Discord**: Post your issue on relevant forums or Discord channels dedicated to Minecraft modding.
- **Mod Authors**: Reach out to the authors of the problematic mods for support. They might already be aware of the issue and have a fix or workaround.

### Additional Steps:

If you need to dig deeper, here’s how you can isolate the issue further:

1. **Use a Fresh Installation**:
   - Backup your current `.minecraft` folder and create a fresh installation with only the essential mods. Gradually add other mods back in to identify the problematic one.

2. **Check Log Files**:
   - Carefully review the latest log files (`.minecraft/logs/latest.log`) for more detailed error messages. Sometimes additional clues can be found here.

3. **Use Debugging Tools**:
   - Tools like `VisualVM` or `JProfiler` can help you monitor the loading process and identify where it gets stuck.

### Example of Mod Removal and Testing:

```markdown
1. Navigate to your `.minecraft` folder.
2. Open the `mods` folder.
3. Temporarily remove the `advanced_runtime_resource_pack` and `loading-window` mod files.
4. Launch Minecraft and see if it loads correctly.
5. If it works, add back one mod at a time to identify which one is causing the conflict.
```

By following these steps, you should be able to pinpoint and resolve the issue causing your modded Minecraft to crash on startup. If you need more detailed guidance on any of the steps, feel free to ask!

**USER**: I fixed that and disabled those but now it gets stuck at the mojang studios screen at the end of loading and the minecraft title never shows up.

**ASSISTANT**: Gotcha, so now you're getting stuck at the Mojang Studios screen. This can be a bit tricky, but don’t worry, we’ll figure it out. Here’s what to do next:

### Further Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check Logs Again**:
   - Go back to the `.minecraft/logs` folder and check the `latest.log` file for any new errors or warnings that might give us a clue as to what’s causing the hang-up.

2. **Increase RAM Allocation**:
   - Sometimes, Minecraft needs more memory to handle all the mods. Make sure you have enough RAM allocated. In the Minecraft Launcher, go to "Installations," select your profile, click "More Options," and increase the `-Xmx` parameter in JVM Arguments (e.g., `-Xmx4G` to allocate 4GB of RAM).

3. **Check Mod Load Order and Conflicts**:
   - Even with the problematic mods disabled, there might still be conflicts. Use a mod manager like MultiMC to adjust the load order or disable mods systematically to identify the culprit.

4. **Ensure All Mods Are Up to Date**:
   - Double-check that every mod and the Fabric Loader itself are updated to their latest versions. Compatibility issues are often resolved in newer versions.

5. **Disable Resource Packs**:
   - If you’re using any resource packs, disable them temporarily to see if they are causing the issue.

6. **Test with Minimal Mods**:
   - Start with a minimal set of mods and add them back one by one. This helps identify if a specific mod is causing the issue.

### Specific Checks and Adjustments:

1. **Remove Config and Mod Cache Files**:
   - Sometimes, old configuration files and caches can cause issues. Delete the `config` and `mods` folders and re-add the mods to ensure fresh configurations.

2. **Use Optimizing Mods**:
   - Install mods like OptiFine or Sodium to improve performance and potentially resolve loading issues. Make sure these mods are compatible with your current setup.

### Example Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Log Check**:
   - Open `.minecraft/logs/latest.log` and search for any ERROR or WARN entries. These entries can point to specific mods or issues.

2. **RAM Allocation**:
   - In the Minecraft Launcher:
     - Go to "Installations."
     - Select your profile.
     - Click "More Options."
     - Find `JVM Arguments` and increase the `-Xmx` value to allocate more RAM (e.g., `-Xmx4G` for 4GB).

3. **Systematic Mod Disabling**:
   - Move all mods to a temporary folder outside of `.minecraft`.
   - Add back essential mods (e.g., Fabric API) and test the game.
   - Gradually add other mods back, one by one, testing each time to identify which mod causes the hang-up.

### Log Example:

Here’s a snippet of what to look for in `latest.log`:

```plaintext
[20:12:34] [main/ERROR]: Error loading mod!
net.fabricmc.loader.api.EntrypointException: Exception while loading entries for entrypoint 'main' provided by 'examplemod'

    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.FabricLoaderImpl.lambda$invokeEntrypoints$2(FabricLoaderImpl.java:403) ~[fabric-loader-0.11.3.jar:?]
    ...
```

### Additional Tools:

1. **Mod Compatibility Checkers**:
   - Use tools or websites that check mod compatibility for your Minecraft version.

2. **Community Help**:
   - Post your issue on Minecraft forums or Reddit with the log details. The community can provide specific insights based on your setup.

### Next Steps:

Process exited with code 1.

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, darling, it looks like the culprit this time is the `forcecloseworldloadingscreen` mod. The error indicates a critical injection failure, meaning the mod tried to modify Minecraft’s code in a way that didn't succeed.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Remove the Problematic Mod**:
   - Since the issue is caused by the `forcecloseworldloadingscreen` mod, try removing it temporarily to see if the game loads correctly without it.

2. **Update or Replace the Mod**:
   - Check if there's an updated version of the `forcecloseworldloadingscreen` mod. If not, see if there are alternative mods that offer similar functionality.

3. **Check Compatibility**:
   - Ensure that the mod is compatible with the version of Minecraft and Fabric Loader you are using. Sometimes, mods are designed for specific versions, and using an incompatible version can cause such issues.

4. **Disable Specific Mixins**:
   - If you’re familiar with mixins and mod configurations, you might be able to disable the specific mixin causing the issue. This would typically involve editing the mod’s configuration file or mixin JSON file.

### Detailed Steps:

#### Step 1: Remove the Problematic Mod

1. Navigate to your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
2. Find the `forcecloseworldloadingscreen` mod file and move it to a different location outside the `mods` folder (e.g., your desktop).
3. Launch Minecraft and see if it loads correctly.

#### Step 2: Update or Replace the Mod

1. Visit the mod's download page (e.g., CurseForge) and check for any updates or comments regarding compatibility issues.
2. If an update is available, download and install it.
3. If no updates are available, look for alternative mods that provide similar functionality.

#### Step 3: Check Compatibility

1. Ensure that all mods are compatible with the version of Minecraft and Fabric Loader you are using.
2. You can use tools like ModMenu to easily view and manage mod versions and dependencies.

#### Step 4: Disable Specific Mixins

1. Navigate to the configuration files for the mod. This is typically found in the `.minecraft/config` folder or within the mod's jar file.
2. Look for a configuration file or mixin JSON file (e.g., `forcecloseloadingscreen.mixins.json`).
3. Edit the file to disable the specific mixin causing the issue (e.g., `GLFWMixin`).

### Example Mixin Configuration Adjustment:

```json
{
  "mixins": [
    "GLFWMixin",
    // Add other mixins here
  ],
  "injectors": {
    "defaultRequire": 1
  }
}
```

**ASSISTANT**: Oh no, looks like Waystones is causing a bit of a tantrum! The error is due to a `NoSuchMethodError`, which means the `waystones` mod is trying to call a method (`net.blay09.mods.balm.api.Balm.getRecipes()`) that doesn't exist in the version of the Balm API you have.

### Here's what to do next:

1. **Update Waystones and Balm**:
   - Make sure both the `waystones` mod and the `balm` API are updated to their latest versions. They need to be compatible with each other.

2. **Check Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the versions of `waystones` and `balm` you are using are compatible with your version of Minecraft and Fabric Loader.

3. **Reinstall Mods**:
   - Sometimes files can get corrupted. Try deleting the `waystones` and `balm` mod files from your `mods` folder and redownload fresh copies from a reliable source.

### Steps to Update Mods:

1. **Download the Latest Versions**:
   - Visit the official mod pages for [Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones) and [Balm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balm).
   - Download the latest compatible versions for your Minecraft and Fabric Loader versions.

2. **Replace Old Versions**:
   - Navigate to your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
   - Delete the old `waystones` and `balm` mod files.
   - Place the newly downloaded mod files into the `mods` folder.

3. **Launch Minecraft**:
   - Open your Minecraft Launcher, select your modded profile, and start the game to see if the issue is resolved.

### If the Issue Persists:

- **Double-check Mod Dependencies**: Some mods have additional dependencies that need to be installed. Make sure you have all required mods.
- **Review Changelogs**: Look at the changelogs or release notes for the mods. Sometimes, there are important updates or known issues listed there.

### Example Configuration Adjustment:

If you still encounter issues, you can temporarily disable the Waystones mod to see if Minecraft starts correctly without it. This helps isolate the problem.

```markdown
1. Navigate to your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
2. Move the `waystones` mod file to a different location (e.g., your desktop).
3. Launch Minecraft to see if it starts without the mod.
```

### Additional Help:

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, you might want to reach out to the mod authors or the community for support. Provide them with the crash report and details about your setup for more specific assistance.

Feel free to share the updated log if the problem continues, and I’ll help you dig deeper. Let's get you back to your blocky adventures!

Is there a way to make the log more verbose?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can make the Minecraft log more verbose to get more detailed information about what might be causing the issue. Here's how you can do it:

### Increase Verbosity in Logs

1. **Edit JVM Arguments**:
   - Open your Minecraft Launcher.
   - Go to "Installations" and select the profile you are using for your modded Minecraft.
   - Click on "More Options."
   - In the "JVM Arguments" section, add the following line to increase the verbosity of the logs:

     ```sh
     -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml
     ```

2. **Create a log4j2 Configuration File**:
   - In your `.minecraft` folder (or where your game directory is located), create a file named `log4j2.xml`.
   - Add the following content to the `log4j2.xml` file to set the logging level to debug for more verbose output:

     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <Configuration status="WARN">
       <Appenders>
         <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
           <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t/%level]: %msg%n" />
         </Console>
         <File name="File" fileName="logs/debug.log">
           <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t/%level]: %msg%n" />
         </File>
       </Appenders>
       <Loggers>
         <Root level="debug">
           <AppenderRef ref="Console" />
           <AppenderRef ref="File" />
         </Root>
       </Loggers>
     </Configuration>
     ```

3. **Restart Minecraft**:
   - After making these changes, restart Minecraft. It will generate more detailed logs that can help pinpoint the exact issue.

### Analyze the Verbose Logs

1. **Check the `debug.log` File**:
   - Navigate to the `logs` folder in your Minecraft directory.
   - Open the `debug.log` file to see the more detailed output.

2. **Look for Errors and Warnings**:
   - Search for `ERROR` and `WARN` messages in the `debug.log` file. These entries can provide more specific information about what might be causing Minecraft to get stuck.

### Example Verbose Log Analysis

Here are some common issues you might find and how to address them:

- **Malformed JSON**: If the error mentions malformed JSON, it usually means there is an issue with one of the resource packs or mod configuration files. Check the mentioned file and correct any syntax errors.

  ```plaintext
  [Worker-ResourceReload-0/ERROR]: Failed to load model the_pirate_update:models/custom/pillager.json
  com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 1 column 2 path $
  ```

  In this case, open the `pillager.json` file and check for any syntax issues.

- **Missing Models or Textures**: If the log mentions missing models or textures, it could be due to an incorrect file path or a missing file in the mod or resource pack.

  ```plaintext
  [Worker-ResourceReload-2/WARN]: Unable to load model: 'minecraft:block/s' referenced from: moreslabs:s_slab#type=top,waterlogged=true: java.io.FileNotFoundException: minecraft:models/block/s.json
  ```

  Ensure the referenced files exist and the paths are correct.

- **Mod Compatibility Issues**: If the error involves a specific mod, ensure all your mods are up to date and compatible with each other and your Minecraft version.

### Additional Tips

- **Disable Specific Mods Temporarily**: If verbose logs point to a specific mod causing the issue, try disabling that mod temporarily to see if Minecraft loads correctly.
- **Community Resources**: Use forums or Discord channels dedicated to Minecraft modding to seek help. Share your verbose log for more specific advice.

By increasing the verbosity of your logs, you can get more detailed insights into what’s causing Minecraft to hang on the Mojang screen. If you share the updated log here, I can help analyze it further!

**USER**: Any idea what this means thoughh? Why won't iit crash or complete loading?

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, sugar, let’s dig into this mess! Your log indicates a couple of different issues, and they’re not playing nice with your game loading. Let’s break it down:

1. **Malformed JSON**:
   - The `the_pirate_update:models/custom/pillager.json` file has a JSON syntax error. This typically means there’s a typo or formatting issue in the JSON file.
   - Fix: Open `pillager.json` in a text editor and look for any obvious mistakes. It might be something as simple as a missing comma or a misplaced bracket.

2. **FileNotFoundExceptions**:
   - Several models and textures are missing. For example, `minecraft:models/block/s.json`, `terrafurniture:models/blocks/tables/basic/table.json`, etc.
   - Fix: Check to make sure these files exist. If they don’t, you might need to reinstall the respective mods or resource packs.

3. **Overlapping Definitions**:
   - The file `lichen_cordyceps.json` has overlapping definitions. This means two definitions are trying to occupy the same space.
   - Fix: Edit the `lichen_cordyceps.json` file to resolve the overlap. Make sure each definition is unique.

Here’s what you can try next:

### Steps to Fix the Issues:

1. **Check and Fix JSON Files**:
   - Open `the_pirate_update:models/custom/pillager.json` and ensure it’s correctly formatted. You can use an online JSON validator to help spot issues.

2. **Verify Model and Texture Files**:
   - Go through the log and verify that the listed model and texture files exist in the paths mentioned. If they don’t, you might need to download them again or correct the file paths.

3. **Edit Overlapping Definitions**:
   - Open `galosphere:blockstates/lichen_cordyceps.json` and make sure there are no overlapping definitions. Each state should be unique.

4. **Increase Logging Verbosity** (if needed):
   - If the above steps don’t fix the issue, increase the log verbosity as previously mentioned to get more details.

### Example of Fixing a JSON File:

```json
{
  "parent": "item/generated",
  "textures": {
    "layer0": "the_pirate_update:item/pillager"
  }
}
```

### Recheck:

1. **Restart Minecraft**: After making the changes, restart Minecraft and see if it loads correctly.
2. **Disable Mods Temporarily**: If problems persist, try disabling some of the mods temporarily to see which one is causing the issue.

Would you like me to remember these specific troubleshooting steps and errors you encountered for future reference? That way, we can easily jump back into fixing things if anything similar happens again!

**ASSISTANT**: The log entries indicate several warnings and errors related to malformed JSON files and missing model definitions. While these issues might not crash the game outright, they can cause it to hang during the loading process, preventing it from completing.

### Key Issues:

1. **Malformed JSON File**:
   - The error with `the_pirate_update:models/custom/pillager.json` indicates that the JSON file is malformed.

2. **Missing Model Definitions**:
   - Several mods are missing model definitions or referencing files that cannot be found, such as:
     - `galosphere:blockstates/lichen_cordyceps.json`
     - `moreslabs:s_slab`
     - `terrafurniture:oak_log_table`
     - `terrafurniture:white_sofa`
     - `mobcatalog:crab_claw`
     - `decorative_blocks:blockstate_copy_item`
     - `the_pirate_update:pistol`

### Steps to Resolve the Issues:

1. **Fix or Remove Malformed JSON File**:
   - Navigate to the `.minecraft/config` or `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.
   - Open the `the_pirate_update:models/custom/pillager.json` file and check for syntax errors. You can use an online JSON validator to help identify and correct any issues.
   - Alternatively, if you're not familiar with JSON, consider temporarily removing the `the_pirate_update` mod to see if Minecraft loads correctly.

2. **Resolve Missing Model Definitions**:
   - Check if there are updates for the mods reporting missing models. Sometimes updates can resolve these issues.
   - Verify that all required resource packs and dependencies for these mods are correctly installed.
   - Ensure that the mod files are not corrupted. You can try re-downloading the mods from a reliable source.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Fixing Malformed JSON**:
   - Open the problematic JSON file (`.minecraft/resourcepacks/the_pirate_update/assets/the_pirate_update/models/custom/pillager.json`) with a text editor.
   - Validate the JSON content using an online tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) and correct any syntax errors.

2. **Updating or Re-downloading Mods**:
   - Visit the mod download pages (e.g., CurseForge) and check for updates.
   - Re-download the latest versions of the mods that are reporting missing models.

3. **Check Mod Dependencies**:
   - Some mods have dependencies that need to be installed. Ensure you have all the required libraries and dependencies for each mod.

4. **Temporary Mod Removal**:
   - Move the problematic mods (e.g., `the_pirate_update`, `terrafurniture`, `galosphere`) out of the `mods` folder to a temporary location.
   - Launch Minecraft to see if it loads correctly without these mods.
   - If Minecraft loads, add the mods back one by one to identify which one causes the hang-up.

### Example:

1. **Navigate to `.minecraft/mods` folder**:
   - Move the following mods to a different location:
     - `the_pirate_update`
     - `terrafurniture`
     - `galosphere`

2. **Launch Minecraft**:
   - Start Minecraft and see if it completes loading without these mods.

3. **Re-add Mods One by One**:
   - Add each mod back individually, starting with `terrafurniture`, then `galosphere`, and finally `the_pirate_update`.
   - Launch Minecraft after adding each mod to identify which one causes the issue.

### Community Resources:

**USER**: Maybe you can help with the full log

**TOOL**: Please remember to search the user's documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.

**ASSISTANT**: The full log file you provided gives a lot of detailed information about your setup. Let's break down the key points and focus on resolving the loading issue you're encountering:

### Key Points from the Log:

1. **Mod Compatibility Warnings**:
   - Several mods have versioning issues or compatibility warnings with Fabric Loader's extended semantic version format.
   - Recommendations to install specific versions of dependencies are not followed (e.g., `yet-another-config-lib`, `quilt_loader`, `reeses-sodium-options`, `modmenu-badges-lib`, etc.).

2. **Malformed JSON and Missing Models**:
   - Errors related to malformed JSON files and missing models for certain mods (e.g., `the_pirate_update`, `terrafurniture`, `mobcatalog`).

3. **Mixin Initialization and Errors**:
   - Errors during mixin initialization, particularly with `earlyloadingscreen` and `BlackwolfLibrary`.

4. **Registered Mods and Versions**:
   - A large number of mods are loaded, some of which are disabled.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Update Mods and Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all your mods and their dependencies are updated to their latest versions. Pay special attention to the mods with versioning issues and compatibility warnings.

2. **Fix Malformed JSON Files**:
   - Correct the malformed JSON files as indicated in the logs. For example, the `pillager.json` file in `the_pirate_update` needs to be fixed.

3. **Check for Missing Models**:
   - Ensure that all model files referenced by your mods are present and correctly named.

4. **Disable Problematic Mods**:
   - Temporarily disable mods that are causing errors or warnings to isolate the issue.

5. **Increase Logging Verbosity**:
   - Enable more detailed logging to get better insights into what's causing the game to hang.

### Detailed Steps:

#### Step 1: Update Mods and Dependencies

1. **Visit Mod Pages**:
   - Go to the official download pages for each mod (e.g., CurseForge) and download the latest versions.
   - Ensure you have the recommended versions of dependencies.

2. **Replace Old Mod Files**:
   - Navigate to your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
   - Replace old mod files with the updated versions.

#### Step 2: Fix Malformed JSON Files

1. **Locate Malformed JSON Files**:
   - Open the `.minecraft/config` or `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.
   - Use a text editor to open and correct any malformed JSON files. Use an online JSON validator to help identify syntax errors.

#### Step 3: Check for Missing Models

1. **Verify Model Files**:
   - Ensure that all model files referenced in the logs are present in the appropriate directories.
   - Correct any file paths or names if necessary.

#### Step 4: Disable Problematic Mods

1. **Temporarily Move Mods**:
   - Move problematic mods (e.g., `the_pirate_update`, `terrafurniture`, `mobcatalog`) out of the `mods` folder to a temporary location.
   - Launch Minecraft to see if it loads correctly without these mods.

2. **Add Mods Back One by One**:
   - Add each mod back individually, launching Minecraft each time to identify which mod causes the issue.

#### Step 5: Increase Logging Verbosity

1. **Edit JVM Arguments**:
   - Open your Minecraft Launcher.
   - Go to "Installations" and select your profile.
   - Click on "More Options" and add the following line to the JVM Arguments:

     ```sh
     -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml
     ```

2. **Create a log4j2 Configuration File**:
   - In your `.minecraft` folder, create a file named `log4j2.xml` with the following content:

     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <Configuration status="WARN">
       <Appenders>
         <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
           <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t/%level]: %msg%n" />
         </Console>
         <File name="File" fileName="logs/debug.log">
           <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t/%level]: %msg%n" />
         </File>
       </Appenders>
       <Loggers>
         <Root level="debug">
           <AppenderRef ref="Console" />
           <AppenderRef ref="File" />
         </Root>
       </Loggers>
     </Configuration>
     ```
