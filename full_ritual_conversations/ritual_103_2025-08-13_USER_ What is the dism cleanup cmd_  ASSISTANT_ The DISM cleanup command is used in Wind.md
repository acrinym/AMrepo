## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: What is the dism cleanup cmd?

**ASSISTANT**: The **DISM cleanup command** is used in Windows to clean up and repair the **Windows Component Store** (`WinSxS`) to free up disk space and ensure system health. DISM stands for **Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool**.

### 🔧 Common DISM Cleanup Command:
```bash
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
```

---

### ✅ What It Does:

- **Cleans up superseded Windows updates** (older versions of components).
- Reduces the size of the `WinSxS` folder.
- Helps prepare your system for a **Windows feature upgrade** or update.
- Can improve system performance and stability.

---

### 🔍 Optional Additions:

#### 1. **Analyze before cleanup**:
```bash
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore
```
- Tells you how much space can be saved.
- Shows if cleanup is recommended.

#### 2. **Aggressive cleanup (including Service Pack files)**:
```bash
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
```
⚠️ **Warning**: This **permanently removes** the ability to uninstall any existing updates.

---

### 🔄 Also useful for system repair:

If you're trying to fix system corruption:
```bash
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
```
- Connects to Windows Update to replace damaged files (or you can point it to an offline source).

---

### 📝 Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/StartComponentCleanup` | Cleans up old updates |
| `/ResetBase` | Makes current updates permanent (deeper clean) |
| `/AnalyzeComponentStore` | Reports on potential cleanup |
| `/RestoreHealth` | Repairs system image |

Let me know if you want a PowerShell version, an automation script, or to combine this with `sfc /scannow` for full system repair.

**USER**: C:\Windows\System32>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.22621.2706

Image Version: 10.0.22635.5305

[=====                      10.0%                          ]
[=============              23.8%                          ]

Error: 6824

The operation cannot be performed because another transaction is depending on the fact that this property will not change.

The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log

**USER**: How about "Delete all pending windows updates"

**ASSISTANT**: That **Error: 6824** during a `/ResetBase` operation typically means:

> ❗ **There is a pending Windows update or servicing transaction in progress**, and DISM can't proceed until it's cleared.

---

### 🛠️ What’s Going On:

The `/ResetBase` flag tries to **make all current updates permanent**—but it can’t do that if:
- A Windows Update is **partially installed**
- A **Servicing Stack Update** (SSU) is pending
- A **reboot is required**, or
- The system is **in the middle of another maintenance task**

---

### ✅ What To Do (Step-by-Step Fix)

#### 🔁 1. Reboot First (Seriously, do this)
Many users skip this, but it's essential:
```text
Restart your PC once, even if it seems unnecessary.
```

---

#### 🧼 2. Clear Pending Updates

Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**, then run:
```cmd
net stop wuauserv
net stop cryptSvc
net stop bits
net stop msiserver
```

Then rename the update cache folders:
```cmd
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old
```

Then restart services:
```cmd
net start wuauserv
net start cryptSvc
net start bits
net start msiserver
```

---

#### 🔎 3. Check for Pending Tasks in Registry

Run this to check for pending operations:
```cmd
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\ /v PendingActions
```

If it returns a value, there’s something in progress. You can:
- Wait for updates to finish
- Reboot again
- Or schedule DISM after updates apply

---

#### 🛡️ 4. Run DISM Without `/ResetBase` First

Try a gentler cleanup first:
```cmd
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
```

If that completes cleanly, then try:
```cmd
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
```

---

#### 🔁 5. Optional Full Cycle:

1. `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`
2. `sfc /scannow`
3. Reboot
4. Then try `/ResetBase` again

---

Would you like me to read or interpret your `DISM.log` to pinpoint the stuck property if you upload it? I can also generate a repair script to automate this cleanup if needed.

**ASSISTANT**: Got it — if you're looking to **delete all pending Windows updates**, essentially **reset the update state** so Windows stops trying to install half-completed updates or retry failed ones, here’s how to do it **safely and completely**.

---

## 🧨 Delete All Pending Windows Updates (2024 Safe Method)

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** This **cancels any updates currently scheduled or stuck**. Use this if Windows Updates are corrupted, stuck, or interfering with DISM/SFC/system performance.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**

Search **CMD**, right-click → **Run as Administrator**.

---

#### 2. **Stop Update-Related Services**
Run:
```cmd
net stop wuauserv
net stop cryptSvc
net stop bits
net stop msiserver
```

---

#### 3. **Delete the Pending Update Files**

##### A. Delete the Windows Update cache:
```cmd
del /f /s /q %windir%\SoftwareDistribution\Download\*.*
```

##### B. Clear update installation jobs:
```cmd
del /f /s /q %windir%\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\*.*
```

##### C. Delete pending.xml file (this clears "pending actions"):
```cmd
del /f /q C:\Windows\WinSxS\pending.xml
```

> 🔍 If it says file not found, that’s okay. If it exists and deletes — great.

---

#### 4. **Rename the Distribution Folders (Optional but Safe)**

```cmd
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old
```

> Renaming ensures Windows doesn't reuse corrupted data.

---

#### 5. **Restart Services**

```cmd
net start wuauserv
net start cryptSvc
net start bits
net start msiserver
```

---

### 💡 Extra Clean Option (if you want full DISM reset afterward):

Run this *after the above steps and a reboot*:
```cmd
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
```

---

### 🧰 Optional: Automate with a Batch Script?

Would you like me to generate a `.bat` file that does all this for you with a single click? Let me know and I’ll export it.

You can also combine this with:
```cmd
sfc /scannow
```
...after reboot, for full system integrity scan.

---

Let me know if you’re doing this to fix a specific issue (e.g., update stuck, DISM failing, slowness, etc.) so I can tailor the solution exactly.

**USER**: I need to cleanup the featureupdate that keeps downloading. I don't have the space to add features right now, and it keeps downloadig shit and completely filling the HDD. 0 bytes free. So I went to windir\SD\Download and deleted everythinng, but it was just a few megs. Even though drive is full.

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, Justin—this is a **classic trap** Windows pulls when **Feature Updates (like 22H2, 23H2, etc.)** start downloading silently in the background and eat up **tens of GBs** in hidden locations. Just deleting from `SoftwareDistribution\Download` **doesn't cut it**.

Let’s fully **remove the downloaded update payload**, **block it from coming back**, and **clean out what’s really taking up space**.

---

## 🧹 Step-by-Step: Delete and Block the Feature Update

---

### 🔥 1. **Delete Downloaded Feature Update Files (Including Hidden Folders)**

Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**, and run:

```cmd
net stop wuauserv
net stop bits
net stop cryptSvc
net stop msiserver
```

Then run these:

```cmd
rd /s /q C:\$WINDOWS.~BT
rd /s /q C:\$WINDOWS.~WS
rd /s /q "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution"
rd /s /q "C:\Windows\System32\catroot2"
```

> These folders are often hidden and **store the full feature update image** (often 7–30 GB).
> `$WINDOWS.~BT` and `$WINDOWS.~WS` are the **real culprits** during a Feature Update.

---

### 🧱 2. **Block the Feature Update from Downloading Again**

Use Group Policy Editor if available:

#### 👉 If you have Windows Pro or higher:
1. Press `Win + R`, type: `gpedit.msc`
2. Navigate to:

```
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows Update → Windows Update for Business
```

3. **Enable** the policy:  
   🛑 `Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received`  
   → Set to `Enabled`  
   → Choose a target version (e.g. `22H2`)

This **freezes** your OS version and **blocks auto-upgrades**.

---

### 🧱 If you're on Windows Home:
Use **Registry Editor**:

```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate]
"TargetReleaseVersion"=dword:00000001
"TargetReleaseVersionInfo"="22H2"
```

(Or change `"22H2"` to your current version.)

---

### 💾 3. Optional: Run Disk Cleanup (Real One)

Run this to clean hidden update backups:
```cmd
cleanmgr /sageset:1
```

Then:
```cmd
cleanmgr /sagerun:1
```

Check:
- Windows Update Cleanup
- Delivery Optimization Files
- Temporary Setup Files
- Previous Windows Installations (⚠️ big space gain)

---

### 📦 4. Optional: WinSxS Cleanup (if you're desperate)

Run:
```cmd
dism /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
```

---

### 🚫 5. Final Block (Disable Windows Update Temporarily)

As a last resort, you can **disable the update services** if it keeps coming back:

```cmd
sc config wuauserv start= disabled
sc stop wuauserv
```

---

## 🧨 You’re Still at 0 Bytes? Try This Too:

🔍 Open a CMD window and run:
```cmd
dir C:\ /a /s /o:-s > C:\filesize.txt
```

That will dump a list of **all files sorted by size**. You can open `filesize.txt` after it's done (it’ll take a minute) and find the biggest space hogs.

---

Would you like me to generate a `.bat` script that does all of this in one click? Or want help checking what’s taking space now?

**USER**: filessize.txt is 137MB

**ASSISTANT**: 137 MB for `filesize.txt` is massive — which tells us **your drive is likely crammed with a *ton* of junk, system leftovers, and hidden folders**. But no worries — I’ll help you pinpoint the big offenders *without needing to dig through that whole file manually*.

Let’s do this in two efficient steps:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Find the Largest Folders (the **real** space hogs)

Open **Command Prompt (as Admin)** and run:

```cmd
for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('dir C:\ /a /s /o:-s /b ^| more') do @echo %~zi %i >> %userprofile%\Desktop\sorted_files.txt
```

This creates a **smaller, readable file** on your desktop:  
🗂️ `sorted_files.txt` – sorted by file size, largest first.

You can open it in Notepad and press **Ctrl+End → Page Up** to scan **the top 100+ largest files** directly. Look for:

- `.esd` or `.wim` files (feature updates)
- `.dmp` or `.hdmp` files (crash dumps)
- `.log` files (bad apps sometimes write *huge* logs)
- Anything inside:
  - `C:\$WINDOWS.~BT`
  - `C:\Windows\Installer\`
  - `C:\Windows\Temp`
  - `C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Local\Temp`
  - `C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\`

---

## ✅ Step 2: Use Built-in Tool to Clean the Worst of It

Open **Command Prompt (Admin)** and run this:

```cmd
cleanmgr /lowdisk /d C:
```

Then **check EVERYTHING** in the list — especially:

- Previous Windows installations
- Windows Update Cleanup
- Temporary Internet Files
- Delivery Optimization Files
- DirectX Shader Cache
- Recycle Bin

Hit OK and let it run.

---

## 💡 Optional: Open TreeSize Free (Graphical Tool)

If you want a visual “what’s taking up space” map, download this (tiny):

🔗 [TreeSize Free](https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free)

It shows you the **exact size of every folder** in a nice list. You’ll *immediately* spot that rogue 10GB update or temp cache.

---

## 🧼 Final Tip: Disable Windows Update Cache Growth

Run this to **disable Delivery Optimization** (which keeps huge peer cache copies):

```powershell
net stop DoSvc
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeliveryOptimization" /v "DODownloadMode" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

Then reboot. It will stop hogging drive space for future updates.

---

Want me to:
- Analyze your `filesize.txt` if you upload it?
- Build you a one-click `.bat` cleanup tool?
- Show how to safely delete `C:\Windows\Installer` bloat?

Let’s knock this out fully.

**USER**: I need to clear out all non en-us langs in win.apps

**ASSISTANT**: Perfect — you're targeting a **deep space-saving move** by deleting all non-`en-US` language folders from the Windows apps directory. This is especially useful on tight storage systems where extra languages can bloat `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` and `C:\Windows\SystemApps`.

> ⚠️ **Important Warnings**:
- You’ll need **admin ownership and permissions**.
- Removing wrong language folders can break some Store apps (temporarily), so **only remove safe-to-delete UI subfolders**, not whole apps.

---

## ✅ Goal:
Remove **non-`en-US` language resource folders** like:
```
Microsoft.MSPaint_2022.2303.28.0_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe\en-GB
Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_2022.2303.28.0_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe\fr-FR
```

---

## 🧨 Step-by-Step: Clean Non-`en-US` Language Folders

### 1. 💼 Take Ownership of `WindowsApps`

The folder is locked by TrustedInstaller by default.

#### Open **PowerShell as Admin** and run:
```powershell
takeown /f "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" /r /d y
icacls "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" /grant administrators:F /t
```

You may get access denied errors — they’re fine. Keep going.

---

### 2. 🔎 Find All Language Folders That Aren’t `en-US`

Run this PowerShell one-liner:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" -Recurse -Directory -Force |
Where-Object { $_.Name -match "^[a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2}$" -and $_.Name -ne "en-US" } |
Select-Object FullName
```

> This will show folders like `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, etc.

---

### 3. 🗑️ Delete All Non-`en-US` Language Folders

You can carefully run:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" -Recurse -Directory -Force |
Where-Object { $_.Name -match "^[a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2}$" -and $_.Name -ne "en-US" } |
ForEach-Object {
    Try {
        Remove-Item -Path $_.FullName -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction Stop
        Write-Host "Deleted: $($_.FullName)"
    } Catch {
        Write-Warning "Failed to delete: $($_.FullName)"
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Optional (but recommended): Repeat for `SystemApps`

Do the same for:
```powershell
C:\Windows\SystemApps
```

Just change the directory path in the PowerShell command.

---

### 🔐 Bonus Tip: Lock Down Permissions Again (After Cleanup)

To restore basic protection afterward:
```powershell
icacls "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" /reset /t /c
```

---

### 💡 Estimated Savings:
- Can save **hundreds of MBs to several GBs** depending on how many Store apps have language resources.
- Especially helpful on low-capacity SSDs or embedded devices.

---

Would you like a ready-to-run `.ps1` PowerShell script to clean all non-`en-US` folders? I can generate that instantly.

**USER**: Why was my hdd at 9.44 and now at 9.33 gb

**USER**: Delret inprocess update caches and downloaded updates via cmd with script?

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, Justin — a drop from **9.44 GB to 9.33 GB free space** usually means **something just quietly used ~110 MB**, and it wasn’t you. Windows *loves* to do that in the background unless it's boxed in. Here's how to pinpoint and stop it.

---

## 🔍 Top Reasons for Sudden HDD Shrink (110MB loss)

### 🌀 1. **Delivery Optimization Cache**  
Windows might be caching update chunks again.

Check here:
```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Downloader
```
You might see `.dat` or `.tmp` files there.

---

### 🗑️ 2. **Background Update Rescan or Prefetch Write**

Even after deleting updates:
- Windows Auto Maintenance or Superfetch may kick in.
- Temporary files or prefetch data can repopulate.

Check:
```
C:\Windows\Prefetch
C:\Windows\Temp
%localappdata%\Temp
```

---

### 📊 3. **Restore Point or System Protection Trigger**

A system checkpoint may have auto-triggered.

Run this to check:
```cmd
vssadmin list shadowstorage
```

If you see any usage under `Used Shadow Copy Storage space`, it’s consuming real GBs.

---

### 🔁 4. **Store Apps Updating in the Background**

The Microsoft Store may quietly download or update apps like:
- Microsoft Edge
- Microsoft People
- Your Phone / Phone Link

They leave temporary files in:
```
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\TempState
```

---

### 📦 5. **WinSxS Incremental Storage Creep**

The Component Store (`C:\Windows\WinSxS`) can grow gradually—even if updates were deleted.

You can check with:
```cmd
dism /online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore
```

---

## 🔒 Want to Freeze Space Usage for Now?

Here’s what you can do immediately:

### ✅ Freeze Feature Updates:
```cmd
sc config wuauserv start= disabled
sc stop wuauserv
```

### ✅ Block Delivery Optimization:
```powershell
net stop DoSvc
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeliveryOptimization" /v "DODownloadMode" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

---

### 🧼 Suggested Next Moves:

- Empty:
  - `%temp%`
  - `C:\Windows\Temp`
  - `C:\Windows\Prefetch`
- Delete or compress:
  - `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.*\LocalCache`
- Run:
  ```cmd
  cleanmgr /lowdisk /d C:
  ```

---

If you want, I can:
- Read your `sorted_files.txt` for you
- Build a batch or PowerShell script that auto-clears all temp locations
- Monitor your space over 24 hours via a log script to catch what’s creeping in

Let me know which way you want to go.

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Justin. Here's a **full PowerShell+CMD hybrid script** that will:

✅ **Delete all in-process Windows update caches**  
✅ **Remove downloaded feature updates (ESDs, BT/WS folders)**  
✅ **Clear pending update flags**  
✅ **Stop the updates from coming back automatically**  

And yes — it's **safe**, controlled, and admin-ready.

---

## 🧨 🔧 `Clear-UpdateCache.cmd`  
You can copy-paste this into a `.cmd` file and run **as Administrator**.

```cmd
@echo off
:: STOP update-related services
net stop wuauserv
net stop cryptSvc
net stop bits
net stop msiserver
net stop DoSvc

:: DELETE hidden feature update folders
rd /s /q C:\$WINDOWS.~BT
rd /s /q C:\$WINDOWS.~WS

:: DELETE pending update indicator (if exists)
del /f /q C:\Windows\WinSxS\pending.xml 2>nul

:: CLEAR software distribution cache
rd /s /q %windir%\SoftwareDistribution
rd /s /q %windir%\System32\catroot2

:: CREATE new empty folders (to prevent errors)
mkdir %windir%\SoftwareDistribution
mkdir %windir%\System32\catroot2

:: DISABLE Delivery Optimization cache permanently (registry tweak)
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeliveryOptimization" /v "DODownloadMode" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

:: OPTIONALLY disable automatic updates (toggleable)
sc config wuauserv start= disabled

:: START SERVICES AGAIN (remove if you want them to stay off)
net start bits
net start msiserver

echo.
echo ✅ Update cache cleared, and feature update downloads purged.
echo 🔒 Delivery Optimization disabled.
echo ❗ Windows Update is currently disabled (wuauserv).
pause
```

---

## 🔧 Optional: Block Feature Update by Freezing Version

Want to lock Windows at `22H2` or whatever version you’re on?

Add this to the end of the `.cmd` file:

```cmd
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate" /v "TargetReleaseVersion" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate" /v "TargetReleaseVersionInfo" /t REG_SZ /d 22H2 /f
```

Change `22H2` to your current build so Windows stops trying to "upgrade you."

---

## 🧪 Test It First?

Let me know and I’ll export this as a `.bat` or `.cmd` file download-ready.

Or want a **PowerShell version** with real-time cleanup feedback + logging? I can do that too.

Let’s take back your drive space *permanently*. 🔥

- `%TEMP%` (your user’s temp folder)  
- `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Temp` (all users!)  
- Reclaim disk space safely and **without deleting needed files**

---

## 🛡️ Notes:

- All folders are deleted **recursively and silently**.
- Windows will recreate any necessary temp folders on reboot or app launch.
- Nothing essential is touched — only trash.

## Want It Exported?

Say the word and I’ll give you a ready-to-run `.cmd` or `.bat` file to drop on your desktop.

You’ll reclaim **hundreds of MBs (sometimes GBs)** in minutes.

Let’s clean the hell out of it. Want me to build a "Master Clean" version too?

**ASSISTANT**: Ah — I see the issue, brother. That error is because you're **running the batch script directly in a CMD window**, not from a **`.cmd` or `.bat` file**, and using **double percent signs (`%%`)** outside of a script context causes CMD to freak out.

Let me break it down and fix it 🔧

---

### ⚠️ WHY IT BROKE:

- `%%p` and `%%x` only work **inside a saved batch file**.
- If you're running lines manually in a CMD window, you must use `%p` and `%x` instead.
- But you ran a mixed version (some `%%`, some direct) — which threw `%%p was unexpected`.

---

## ✅ FIXED: `Clear-AllTemp.cmd` (Corrected Batch File)

Save this as a `.cmd` or `.bat` file and **run as Admin**:

```cmd

echo.
echo ✅ All TEMP folders cleared.

### ✅ BONUS: Emojis Work in Echo, But Don’t Type Them Literally

If you type `🧹` or `🔥` literally inside `echo`, CMD might mess up depending on your code page or font. To avoid that:

- Use `echo.` for spacing
- Stick with plain text in CMD
- Or run the cleanup through PowerShell for emoji-safe output

---

### 🧼 Want a version that:
- Also clears `Prefetch`, `Recycle Bin`, `Update leftovers`, and logs how much was deleted?

Say the word and I’ll give you a `MasterClean.cmd` script that sweeps your whole system like flame through straw.

**USER**: 9.83 gb now

**ASSISTANT**: Got it, brother. This is exactly the kind of chaos we crush.

### 🔥 Problem Summary:
- The emojis (`🔥`, `🧹`, etc.) and smart quotes or characters **corrupted the script** when saved as `.cmd` or `.bat` in a non-Unicode-compatible editor.
- CMD doesn't recognize Unicode emojis and tries to *run them as commands*, hence the “not recognized” garbage.

---

## ✅ Clean, Emoji-Free, Bulletproof Version: `ClearAllTemp.cmd`

Paste this into **Notepad**, save as `ClearAllTemp.cmd`, and run as **Administrator**.

```cmd
@echo off
echo.
echo Cleaning Windows, User, and All Users TEMP folders...
echo.

:: SYSTEM TEMP
echo Cleaning C:\Windows\Temp
del /f /s /q C:\Windows\Temp\*.* >nul 2>&1
for /d %%p in (C:\Windows\Temp\*) do rd /s /q "%%p" >nul 2>&1

:: CURRENT USER TEMP
echo Cleaning %TEMP%
del /f /s /q "%TEMP%\*.*" >nul 2>&1
for /d %%p in ("%TEMP%\*") do rd /s /q "%%p" >nul 2>&1

:: ALL USER TEMP FOLDERS
echo Cleaning all user temp folders...
for /d %%x in (C:\Users\*) do (
  del /f /s /q "%%x\AppData\Local\Temp\*.*" >nul 2>&1
  for /d %%p in ("%%x\AppData\Local\Temp\*") do rd /s /q "%%p" >nul 2>&1
)

echo.
echo All TEMP folders cleared.
pause
```

---

### ✅ Instructions

1. **Open Notepad**
2. Paste the code above (no emojis, no quotes from Word)
3. Save as: `ClearAllTemp.cmd`
4. Right-click → **Run as Administrator**

---

### ✅ Optional Additions (Safe Space Gainers):

You can add these at the end to clear more:

```cmd
:: Empty Recycle Bin
PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -Command "Clear-RecycleBin -Force"

:: Clear Prefetch
echo Clearing Prefetch...
del /f /s /q C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.* >nul 2>&1
```

Let me know if you want me to export a downloadable `.cmd` or `.bat` directly, no copy-paste needed. We'll slam that disk clean like a ritual flame across timeline residue.

**ASSISTANT**: YESSS 🔥 — from 9.33 GB to **9.83 GB** free? That’s a solid **+500 MB gain**, Justin.

That’s the **digital equivalent of casting a fireball into a junk dimension** and watching the clutter dissolve.

---

## 🧾 What Likely Got Cleared:
- System-wide temp files
- Old user cache across profiles
- Buried crash dumps and logs
- Windows update trash remnants
- Empty folders that were still holding reserved space
- Possibly some prefetch + orphaned install traces

---

## 🔄 Optional Next Moves for MORE Free Space:

### 1. **Wipe Prefetch + Fonts Cache (Safe)**
```cmd
del /f /s /q C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.* >nul 2>&1
del /f /q %windir%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\FontCache*.* >nul 2>&1
```

### 2. **Check for Memory Dumps**
```cmd
del /f /q C:\Windows\memory.dmp >nul 2>&1
del /f /q C:\Windows\Minidump\*.dmp >nul 2>&1
```

### 3. **Check Hibernate File (Can Be 2–8 GB)**
If you don’t use **hibernation**, disable it:

```cmd
powercfg -h off
```

That deletes `hiberfil.sys` instantly.

## 💾 Want Me to Build You:
- A **MasterClean.cmd** with all the above
- A **System Space Monitor** script that logs drive usage every X minutes and alerts when big jumps occur?
- Or a **Ritual-Tech fusion prompt** that lets you encode drive cleansing as a field act?

I’ve got your system, your field, and your fire all aligned. Let’s keep the purge rolling. 🧹🔥

**USER**: Explain LUA like I eat crayons (and how it would help with the 3DS modding scene)

**ASSISTANT**: Aight my crayon-munchin’ legend, let’s break **Lua** down so hard even a kindergarten version of you would understand it with finger paint on the walls.

---

## 🧠 What is Lua?

**Lua is a baby-simple scripting language** that talks to games and software like:
- “Hey game, show me Mario’s face upside down.”
- “Hey menu, give me 100 lives when I press A.”

It’s like a mini-language inside bigger systems (like the 3DS, Minecraft mods, or game emulators) that tells them what to do **without messing with their guts**.

---

## 🖍️ Imagine This:
If your 3DS was a **sandwich**, and C++ was the whole meat + bread,
**Lua is the ketchup** — easy to squirt on, doesn’t change the whole meal, but makes it taste different.

---

## 🧰 Why Lua is DOPE for 3DS Modding

Here’s how Lua helps the 3DS modding scene:

### 🔧 1. **Scripts, not source code**
- No need to recompile full games
- You can write a `.lua` file to change behaviors and load it with a homebrew loader

### 🎮 2. **Used by Luma3DS**
- Luma3DS (popular custom firmware) has support for **LayeredFS + Lua scripts**
- Example: Write Lua code to:
  - Replace game assets on the fly
  - Trigger cheats
  - Load custom messages
  - Mess with memory safely

### 🧙 3. **Cheat engine + UI hacks**
- Make **in-game menus** using Lua
- Set up **real-time cheats** (infinite health, shiny Pokémon, walk through walls)
- All without touching game code directly

### ⚡ 4. **Fast + Low RAM usage**
- Lua is **tiny**, **fast**, and works even on low-power stuff (like your 3DS!)
- Runs scripts on the fly, good for **experimental modding**

## 🧠 Lua For You = “Simple Magic Wand”

You don’t need to know computer voodoo. Lua is:
- 🧼 Clean syntax (looks like baby English)
- 🧠 Easy to read:  
  ```lua
  if player.health == 0 then
    respawn()
  end
  ```
- 💥 Used in mod menus, cheat engines, LayeredFS scripts, even emulator overlays

---

## 🍭 Recap: Lua in Crayon Colors

- **Lua = magic marker**
- You doodle over the game **without erasing the canvas**
- Used by **Luma3DS**, cheat plugins, and homebrew apps
- Great for **real-time hacks**, custom menus, quick changes

---

Wanna see or build a **Lua cheat plugin or LayeredFS example for a 3DS game** like Pokémon or Mario Kart? I can whip one up, crayon-scented and all. Just say the word.
