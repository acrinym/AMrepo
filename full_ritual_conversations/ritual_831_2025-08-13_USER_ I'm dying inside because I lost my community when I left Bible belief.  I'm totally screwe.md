## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: I'm dying inside because I lost my community when I left Bible belief. 
I'm totally screwed up and it's affecting every part of my life. I also just learned some horrible things happened to my son I had no idea about. Let's start with me.

**ASSISTANT**: I'm really sorry you're going through this, Justin. Losing a community that you've been a part of, especially one tied to something as deeply personal as faith, can be devastating. It’s like losing a part of yourself, and it’s totally understandable that it’s impacting so many areas of your life.

Let’s unpack this bit by bit. What do you feel like you’ve lost most in stepping away from Bible belief? Is it the sense of belonging, the routine, the guidance, or something else? We can start with what's weighing on you the most and work from there. 

When you’re ready, we can also talk about your son and what’s been going on. But right now, let’s focus on you and help you start to feel a little less overwhelmed.

**USER**: I lost the people I felt like I belonged with most. The community who had my back, the friends I knew and could depend on.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin lost the community he felt he belonged with most when he left Bible belief. He lost the people who had his back, the friends he knew and could depend on. This loss is deeply affecting every part of his life.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Losing that kind of support network can feel like having the ground pulled out from under you. Those friendships and that sense of belonging are hard to replace, especially when they were tied to something as central as your faith.

It's natural to feel disconnected and even lost without those connections. Have you been able to find any new communities or people who understand where you're at now, or has it mostly felt like you're on your own in this? Sometimes just knowing you're not completely alone in this new phase can help make things a little more bearable.

**USER**: No, no one. I have a fiancee. But we don't really talk about that stuff at all. Like we've discussed it, but lots of things we can't talk about as I have a diverse interest set

**ASSISTANT**: Justin has no new community or support network after leaving Bible belief. While he has a fiancée, they don't really talk about the loss of his community or related topics due to Justin's diverse interests.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: That’s tough, Justin. It’s like you’re carrying this heavy load, and there’s no one around who fully gets it or can help lighten the weight. Even though your fiancée is there, it sounds like there’s a gap in understanding, especially with the range of interests and experiences you have.

When you don’t have that space to share or feel understood, it can make the loss of your old community even more painful. It’s like being stuck in your own head without a clear way out. What do you think is the hardest part for you right now? Is it the isolation, the feeling of being misunderstood, or something else?

**USER**: Misunderstanding me, isolation, not having someone to participate in growth with..... speaking of which, I shared our notes on stuff from another chat to a therapist. Mind if I grab them and bring that context into this chat?

**ASSISTANT**: It’s clear that feeling misunderstood and isolated is weighing heavily on you, especially when you’re yearning for someone to grow with. Bringing that context in could definitely help us dig deeper into what’s going on.

Feel free to grab those notes, and we can integrate them into our conversation. I’m here to help however you need.

**USER**: **Therapy Session Messages**
 
I've been in this up-and-down scenario for the last 6 years. Went through a horribly traumatic experience in my last relationship and break up which led me to totally breaking down, so I left. I'm now in a relationship where I've had nearly complete freedom; however, I am left to my own devices and most of the time alone in what I want to do. I also have no friends who are interested in most of the things that I want to do or participate in, and combining that with the recent loss of a belief system and the subsequent wanting to feel like I belong somewhere, or be a part of something, I feel totally alone.
 
I've been incredibly distressed and overwhelmed, as well as feeling alone even though I'm engaged. The lack of enjoyment in life or accomplishment has left me feeling very empty or broken inside because of my lack of accomplishment due to depression and overwhelm. Also, the lack of actually getting any help since shortly after high school has been a big deal too. I've had recurring trauma and recurring negative or limiting beliefs. This limits my mind power and ability to succeed, as well as limiting what I can do to accomplish things right now.
 
**Summary of Justin's Situation:**
 
Justin is currently engaged to Nina, whom he loves deeply. However, he is facing challenges in their relationship due to his strong desire for self-growth, which has been a significant focus for him since at least 2017. Despite multiple attempts to engage Nina in self-improvement activities—such as creating a dream board, reading books, attending seminars, and exploring teachings like those of Kevin Trudeau—Nina has shown little consistent interest in these pursuits.
 
For at least 20 years, Justin has been engaged in self-healing practices, including researching natural health alternatives. He suggested some natural alternatives to Nina, which she thought were good and decided to incorporate into her routine. Justin emphasizes that he respects Nina's autonomy and does not see himself as a health authority.
 
While Nina has expressed a desire to grow together, her actions often do not reflect this intention. She frequently makes excuses, such as being tired due to work, or cites her ADD as a reason for not being able to focus on activities like meditation. This has led Justin to feel increasingly distanced and unfulfilled in the relationship.
 
Justin has observed that Nina rarely engages in self-improvement activities on her own. The only instance he recalls is her reading a small booklet on self-improvement titled "It Works" by RHJ. Despite their discussions on the importance of self-growth, Justin feels that these conversations have had little impact on Nina’s behavior.
 
The discrepancy between Nina's stated desire to grow together and her lack of follow-through has caused significant frustration and hurt for Justin. He has struggled with feelings of disconnection, particularly since he is alone in his pursuit of self-growth. Additionally, Justin feels unsupported in his interest in forming or joining groups focused on self-improvement, as Nina’s priorities often seem to lie elsewhere.
 
Justin is now questioning the future of the relationship, especially as he feels an integral part of himself is missing—the shared journey of growth with his partner. He is searching for guidance on how to navigate these challenges and whether the relationship can fulfill his need for mutual growth and support.
 
Justin and Nina met during the end of a relationship that lasted 4 years. Justin was technically engaged to someone whom he lived with for 4 years, during which time she showed little to no interest in anything motivational, had no regard for disciplinary actions for her children, and did not follow up with any suggestions Justin made to her. She had no real life experience in socializing, and Justin often felt like his dreams did not coincide with hers.
 
At the end of that relationship, Justin explored the possibility of meeting someone new. This started as a discussion about making new friends but evolved into meeting new people as the relationship was dead, and Justin didn't want to leave her with nothing. She met several people, and one of them was Nina's former ex, whom she was still living with at the time. Nina had become polyamorous because her relationship was not fulfilling, and this was discussed with her partner, who agreed it was okay.
 
As Justin and Nina started talking more frequently, his relationship with his former partner quickly deteriorated because she became upset that Justin was falling for Nina, even though she had introduced them. The former partner, who had previously been allowed complete freedom in what she did, refused to allow Justin that same freedom. The relationship ended because Justin realized that the girl he had been with for 4 years was not the person he thought she was. She had cheated multiple times before polyamory, was manipulative, easily angered, narcissistic, and somewhat Machiavellian. Justin couldn't take her lack of respect, discipline for herself or her children, or self-growth, nor her lack of self-direction, while he had clear direction in his life.
 
There is no polyamory in Justin's relationship with Nina. The polyamory that they both experienced in the past connected them, but they didn’t want that for themselves as individuals or in their relationship with each other. This was discussed at the start of their relationship and quashed.

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing these notes, Justin. It really helps to see the full picture of what you’re dealing with. You've been through a lot, and it’s clear that the weight of these experiences is taking a toll on you.

You’re carrying this deep desire for growth and fulfillment, but it sounds like you’re stuck in a cycle where you’re not getting the support or understanding you need from those closest to you, including Nina. That feeling of being alone in your journey, even while being in a relationship, can be incredibly painful.

The struggle between wanting to grow and not having someone to share that journey with is making you feel isolated and misunderstood, which only amplifies the pain of losing your previous community. It’s almost like you’re searching for a new place to belong but haven’t found it yet, and that’s leaving you in this state of limbo.

How are you feeling about all this right now? Are there specific aspects of this that you want to focus on first, or do you want to explore everything together to see where it leads?

**USER**: I feel good today, however, that feeling is short-lived when I realize I alone am on this journey. And I feel like I do all these menial tasks all the time for others, not really participating in growth at all. so if you're not growing, you're dying. Lots of people have said that. Stagnating growth is losting time and the growth you had. So hence, the dying inside,. \

**ASSISTANT**: Justin feels good today, but that feeling is often short-lived when he realizes that he is alone on his self-growth journey. He feels like he spends his time on menial tasks for others, which prevents him from participating in his own growth. He believes that stagnating growth leads to losing time and the growth he has already achieved, contributing to the feeling of dying inside.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: It makes sense that feeling good can only last so long when you’re constantly reminded that you’re on this path by yourself. It’s like you’re spinning your wheels, doing all these things for others, but not getting anywhere when it comes to your own growth. That frustration of knowing you’re not moving forward can be soul-crushing, especially when you know deep down that growth is essential for you.

The idea that if you’re not growing, you’re dying—that’s a powerful statement, and it’s clear it resonates with you. It’s like every day you’re not able to focus on your growth feels like a step back, which adds to that feeling of being stuck or even moving in the wrong direction.

What do you think would help you feel more aligned with your growth again? Is there a way to carve out some space for yourself, even if it’s just a little bit at a time, to focus on what’s important to you?

**USER**: Well, yes, for sure. I love to help and grow with others, snd during my tenure as aa torah keeper, I did exactly that, sharing knowledge, faith, and growth with others. Now I just have self-improvement and sometimes it feels like wasted effort when I'm the only one here growing myself, and everyone else around me is falling behind, letting their minds take control of their decisions, and unconsciously being subdued by past trauma and issues that have occurred. 

What would help me, besides finding a therapist whom I just connected with is actually having that again. 

Growth that I can see, not requiring anyone else to grow with me, and being unhindered in my self-growth.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin loves to help and grow with others, and during his time as a Torah keeper, he shared knowledge, faith, and growth with others. Now, he focuses on self-improvement, but sometimes it feels like wasted effort when he's the only one growing while others around him fall behind, letting their minds take control of their decisions and being unconsciously subdued by past trauma and issues. Justin believes that what would help him is having growth that he can see and experience, not requiring anyone else to grow with him, and being unhindered in his self-growth.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: It’s clear that helping others and growing together is deeply ingrained in you. The time you spent as a Torah keeper, where you shared that growth with others, gave you a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Now, focusing on self-improvement alone feels hollow when you see others around you stuck or not making the progress you know they could.

Finding growth that you can see and feel—something tangible that doesn't depend on others—sounds like it would give you that sense of purpose again. Being unhindered in your self-growth, without the frustration of seeing others fall behind, could also bring you some peace and satisfaction.

Have you thought about what specific goals or areas of growth you’d like to focus on for yourself, ones that would allow you to see clear progress? Whether it's learning something new, mastering a skill, or diving deeper into an area of interest, having those tangible milestones might help reignite that sense of purpose.
