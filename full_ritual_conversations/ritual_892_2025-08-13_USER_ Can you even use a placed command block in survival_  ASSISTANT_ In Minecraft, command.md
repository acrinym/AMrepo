**USER**: Can you even use a placed command block in survival?

**ASSISTANT**: In Minecraft, command blocks are typically used in creative mode for executing commands and automating various actions. In survival mode, players cannot obtain command blocks through normal gameplay without using cheats or commands. However, here are the steps to use a command block in survival mode if you have access to commands:

1. **Enable Cheats:**
   - Open the game to LAN and enable cheats if they are not already enabled in your world.

2. **Give Command Block:**
   - Use the command `/give @p command_block` to give yourself a command block.

3. **Place and Use the Command Block:**
   - Place the command block in the world.
   - Right-click on the command block to open its interface.
   - Enter the command you want to execute.
   - You can activate the command block using a redstone signal, such as a button or lever.

Keep in mind that this process requires enabling cheats, which is generally not allowed in a standard survival game without changing the game settings.

**USER**: Yes they're used in creative, but can they be used in survival?

**ASSISTANT**: In standard Minecraft survival mode, command blocks cannot be used as they are intended for use in creative mode or by administrators on multiplayer servers to execute commands and automate tasks. However, there are ways to interact with command blocks in survival mode if cheats are enabled:

1. **Enable Cheats:**
   - If cheats are enabled in your survival world, you can access command blocks through commands.

2. **Obtain a Command Block:**
   - Use the command `/give @p command_block` to give yourself a command block.

3. **Place and Use the Command Block:**
   - Place the command block in your world.
   - Right-click on the command block to open its interface.
   - Enter the command you wish to execute.
   - Activate the command block using a redstone signal, such as a button, lever, or pressure plate.

While this method allows you to use command blocks in survival mode, it essentially bypasses the survival gameplay mechanics by enabling cheats. Therefore, command blocks are not naturally part of survival gameplay without altering the game settings.

**USER**: Create a jukebox using commands that I can enter into a command block. I want it to mute all other music and play "creative", "menu" and the original music of minecraft, not Lena's music. It can be toggled on with a redstone switch which will run to it with redstone dust and a toggle switch.

**ASSISTANT**: To create a jukebox using command blocks in Minecraft that mutes all other music and plays specific tracks, you will need to use multiple command blocks. Below are the steps and the commands to achieve this:

1. **Mute All Other Music:**
   - Place a command block and set it to repeat mode.
   - Enter the following command to stop all music:
     ```
     /stopsound @a music
     ```

2. **Play "Creative" Music:**
   - Place a command block next to the first one and set it to chain mode.
   - Enter the following command to play the "Creative" music:
     ```
     /playsound minecraft:music.game creative @a
     ```

3. **Play "Menu" Music:**
   - Place another command block next to the second one and set it to chain mode.
   - Enter the following command to play the "Menu" music:
     ```
     /playsound minecraft:music.menu @a
     ```

4. **Play Original Minecraft Music (Not Lena's Music):**
   - Place another command block next to the third one and set it to chain mode.
   - Enter the following command to play a specific original Minecraft music track:
     ```
     /playsound minecraft:music.game @a
     ```

5. **Set Up Redstone Toggle:**
   - Connect the first command block to a redstone toggle switch using redstone dust.

### Example Command Block Setup

1. **First Command Block (Repeat Mode):**
   - Command: `/stopsound @a music`
   - Type: Repeat
   - Condition: Always Active

2. **Second Command Block (Chain Mode):**
   - Command: `/playsound minecraft:music.game creative @a`
   - Type: Chain
   - Condition: Conditional
   - Redstone: Always Active

3. **Third Command Block (Chain Mode):**
   - Command: `/playsound minecraft:music.menu @a`
   - Type: Chain
   - Condition: Conditional
   - Redstone: Always Active

4. **Fourth Command Block (Chain Mode):**
   - Command: `/playsound minecraft:music.game @a`
   - Type: Chain
   - Condition: Conditional
   - Redstone: Always Active

### Redstone Setup

1. Place a lever or button to act as your toggle switch.
2. Connect redstone dust from the switch to the first command block.

When you activate the lever/button, it will stop all other music and play the specified tracks. Ensure that the command blocks are set up correctly and connected properly with redstone.

By using these commands and setup, you will be able to create a custom jukebox that mutes all other music and plays the specified tracks when toggled on.

**USER**: Make me a command that takes any ore blocks in the chunk and places it into a checs

**ASSISTANT**: To create a command that takes any ore blocks in a chunk and places them into a chest, you can use a combination of Minecraft's `/fill`, `/clone`, and `/setblock` commands. However, Minecraft commands do not directly support detecting and moving items to a chest based on specific criteria (like ores) without using external tools or mods. But, we can create a workaround with command blocks to approximate this behavior.

Below are the steps and commands to set up the system:

1. **Detect and Replace Ore Blocks with Air:**
   - Use the `/fill` command to replace ore blocks with air and store the positions of these blocks.

2. **Place Ores into a Chest:**
   - Use command blocks to place the ore blocks into a designated chest.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up the Command Blocks

1. **Clear Ore Blocks:**
   - Place a repeating command block to replace all ore blocks in the chunk with air.
   - Command:
     ```
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:iron_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:gold_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:diamond_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:coal_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:emerald_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:redstone_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:lapis_ore
     ```

2. **Store Ores in a Chest:**
   - Use a chain of command blocks to place ores into a chest at a specific location.
   - Commands for each ore type:
     ```
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:chest
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:iron_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:gold_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:diamond_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:coal_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:emerald_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:redstone_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:lapis_ore
     ```

### Step 2: Activate the System

1. **Redstone Toggle:**
   - Use a redstone switch to activate the repeating command block.

### Example Commands and Setup

1. **Repeating Command Block (Replace Ores with Air):**
   - Command:
     ```
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:iron_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:gold_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:diamond_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:coal_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:emerald_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:redstone_ore
     /fill ~-7 ~-7 ~-7 ~8 ~8 ~8 air replace minecraft:lapis_ore
     ```
   - Type: Repeating
   - Condition: Unconditional
   - Redstone: Needs Redstone

2. **Chain Command Blocks (Store Ores in Chest):**
   - Command for placing ores into the chest:
     ```
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:chest
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:iron_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:gold_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:diamond_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:coal_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:emerald_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:redstone_ore
     /setblock <x> <y> <z> minecraft:lapis_ore
     ```
   - Type: Chain
   - Condition: Conditional
   - Redstone: Always Active

### Redstone Setup

1. Place a lever or button to act as your toggle switch.
2. Connect redstone dust from the switch to the first repeating command block.

This setup will effectively simulate moving ore blocks from the chunk into a chest. The exact coordinates `<x> <y> <z>` should be replaced with the coordinates where you want the chest to be located. 

### Note
This method is a bit of a workaround due to the limitations of Minecraft commands in survival mode. For more complex automation, mods like Minecraft's Forge or Fabric with custom scripts would be more suitable.

**USER**: Using the smallest amout of materials and blocks, create a lit-TNT dropper command block.

**ASSISTANT**: To create a lit-TNT dropper using the smallest amount of materials and command blocks, you can use a single command block that activates when triggered by redstone. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. **Place a Command Block:**
   - Place a command block in your world.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Enter the following command into the command block to summon lit TNT one block above the command block's location:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~1 ~ {Fuse:0}
     ```

3. **Set Up the Redstone Trigger:**
   - Place a button, lever, or any redstone activator next to the command block to trigger it.

### Example Setup

1. **Place the Command Block:**
   - Find the location where you want the TNT to be summoned and place the command block there.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Open the command block interface and enter the command:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~1 ~ {Fuse:0}
     ```

3. **Set Up Redstone:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block, or use a redstone torch, redstone dust, or any other redstone mechanism to activate the command block.

### Final Setup:

- **Command Block Command:**
  ```
  /summon tnt ~ ~1 ~ {Fuse:0}
  ```

- **Redstone Activation:**
  - Attach a button or lever directly to the command block, or use a simple redstone circuit to activate it.

### Steps:

1. **Place Command Block:**
   - In the world, place the command block where you want the TNT to be dropped from.

2. **Configure Command Block:**
   - Open the command block and paste the command `/summon tnt ~ ~1 ~ {Fuse:0}`.

3. **Redstone Activation:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block to trigger it.

When you press the button or activate the lever, lit TNT will be summoned one block above the command block and will immediately drop and explode. This setup uses the minimal amount of materials and blocks for a lit-TNT dropper.

**USER**: Won't it damage the command block?

**ASSISTANT**: You're correct that the explosion from the TNT would damage the command block. To prevent the command block from being destroyed, we can summon the TNT a few blocks above the command block, allowing it to fall and explode away from the command block itself. 

Hereâ€™s an improved setup:

1. **Place a Command Block:**
   - Place a command block in your world.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Enter the following command into the command block to summon lit TNT four blocks above the command block's location:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~4 ~ {Fuse:20}
     ```

3. **Set Up the Redstone Trigger:**
   - Place a button, lever, or any redstone activator next to the command block to trigger it.

### Example Setup

1. **Place the Command Block:**
   - Find the location where you want the TNT to be summoned and place the command block there.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Open the command block interface and enter the command:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~4 ~ {Fuse:20}
     ```

3. **Set Up Redstone:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block, or use a redstone torch, redstone dust, or any other redstone mechanism to activate the command block.

### Final Setup:

- **Command Block Command:**
  ```
  /summon tnt ~ ~4 ~ {Fuse:20}
  ```

- **Redstone Activation:**
  - Attach a button or lever directly to the command block, or use a simple redstone circuit to activate it.

### Steps:

1. **Place Command Block:**
   - In the world, place the command block where you want the TNT to be dropped from.

2. **Configure Command Block:**
   - Open the command block and paste the command `/summon tnt ~ ~4 ~ {Fuse:20}`.

3. **Redstone Activation:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block to trigger it.

By summoning the TNT four blocks above the command block with a fuse of 20 ticks, the TNT will have enough time to fall and explode away from the command block, preventing any damage to it.

**USER**: How about 4 blocks below the command block?

**ASSISTANT**: To summon lit TNT four blocks below the command block, you can adjust the coordinates in the command accordingly. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Place a Command Block:**
   - Place a command block in your world.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Enter the following command into the command block to summon lit TNT four blocks below the command block's location:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}
     ```

3. **Set Up the Redstone Trigger:**
   - Place a button, lever, or any redstone activator next to the command block to trigger it.

### Example Setup

1. **Place the Command Block:**
   - Find the location where you want the TNT to be summoned and place the command block there.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Open the command block interface and enter the command:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}
     ```

3. **Set Up Redstone:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block, or use a redstone torch, redstone dust, or any other redstone mechanism to activate the command block.

### Final Setup:

- **Command Block Command:**
  ```
  /summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}
  ```

- **Redstone Activation:**
  - Attach a button or lever directly to the command block, or use a simple redstone circuit to activate it.

2. **Configure Command Block:**
   - Open the command block and paste the command `/summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}`.

3. **Redstone Activation:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block to trigger it.

When you press the button or activate the lever, lit TNT will be summoned four blocks below the command block and will explode after a short delay, ensuring the command block is safe from the explosion.

**USER**: How would I repeat this command until stopped?

**ASSISTANT**: To repeat the command to summon lit TNT until stopped, you can use a repeating command block. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Place a Repeating Command Block:**
   - Place a command block in your world and set it to "Repeat" mode.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Enter the following command into the repeating command block to summon lit TNT four blocks below the command block's location:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}
     ```

3. **Set Up the Redstone Toggle:**
   - Place a lever next to the repeating command block to turn it on and off.

### Steps:

1. **Place Repeating Command Block:**
   - Find the location where you want the TNT to be summoned and place the repeating command block there.

2. **Configure Repeating Command Block:**
   - Open the command block interface and set the block type to "Repeat".
   - Set the redstone requirement to "Needs Redstone".
   - Enter the command:
     ```
     /summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}
     ```

3. **Redstone Activation:**
   - Place a lever on the side of the repeating command block.

### Final Setup:

1. **Repeating Command Block Command:**
   ```
   /summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}
   ```

2. **Set Repeating Command Block to "Needs Redstone":**
   - Open the command block interface.
   - Set the block type to "Repeat".
   - Set the redstone requirement to "Needs Redstone".

3. **Redstone Activation:**
   - Place a lever on the side of the command block.

When you flip the lever, the repeating command block will continuously summon lit TNT four blocks below it. When you turn the lever off, it will stop summoning TNT. This setup allows you to toggle the TNT dropping on and off as needed.

**USER**: How can I summon a repeating command block?

**ASSISTANT**: To summon a repeating command block with a specific command, you can use another command block to place it. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Use a regular command block to summon a repeating command block:**
   - Place a regular command block in your world.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Enter the following command to summon a repeating command block with the desired command inside it:
     ``` 
     /setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:repeating_command_block{Command:"/summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}
     ```

This command will place a repeating command block one block above the regular command block with the command to summon TNT, and it will be automatically set to "Always Active."

### Steps:

1. **Place a Regular Command Block:**
   - Place a regular command block in your world.

2. **Enter the Summon Command:**
   - Open the command block interface and enter the following command:
     ``` 
     /setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:repeating_command_block{Command:"/summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}
     ```

3. **Activate the Command Block:**
   - Place a button or lever next to the regular command block and activate it to run the command.

### Example Setup:

1. **Regular Command Block:**
   - Place a command block on the ground.

2. **Configure Regular Command Block:**
   - Open the command block interface.
   - Enter the command:
     ``` 
     /setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:repeating_command_block{Command:"/summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}
     ```

3. **Redstone Activation:**
   - Place a button or lever on the side of the command block.
   - Activate the button or lever to place the repeating command block above it.

When you activate the regular command block, it will summon a repeating command block one block above it with the command to summon TNT. This repeating command block will automatically start summoning TNT four blocks below it continuously. If you need to stop it, you can either destroy the repeating command block or deactivate it using another command.

**USER**: Well, no I meant in the chat. Summon command block with the tnt dropping attributes, not use a command block to summon another command block. :)

**ASSISTANT**: To summon a repeating command block using a command in the chat, you can use the `/setblock` command with the correct NBT data. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Open the Chat:**
   - Press `T` to open the chat in Minecraft.

2. **Enter the Command:**
   - Enter the following command to place a repeating command block at your position or a specified position with the desired command:
     ```
     /setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:repeating_command_block{Command:"summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}
     ```

### Explanation:

- `~ ~1 ~` places the command block one block above your current position.
- `minecraft:repeating_command_block` specifies the type of command block.
- `{Command:"summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}` sets the command inside the repeating command block and makes it always active.

### Steps:

1. **Open Chat:**
   - Press `T` to open the chat window.

2. **Enter Command:**
   - Type the following command:
     ```
     /setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:repeating_command_block{Command:"summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}
     ```

3. **Execute the Command:**
   - Press `Enter` to run the command.

This will create a repeating command block one block above your current position, and it will continuously summon lit TNT four blocks below it with a fuse time of 20 ticks.

If you want to place the command block at a specific location, replace `~ ~1 ~` with the coordinates where you want to place the command block, like so:
```
/setblock x y z minecraft:repeating_command_block{Command:"summon tnt ~ ~-4 ~ {Fuse:20}",auto:1b}
```

Replace `x y z` with your desired coordinates.
