**USER**: What about this regular hardware store? Do you think it would have hose clamps?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, regular hardware stores often carry hose clamps. Stores like Palmer Auto Parts in Farwell, Michigan, which doubles as a hardware store, likely have hose clamps among their inventory. Additionally, general hardware stores in the area would typically stock such items.

It's best to call ahead to confirm availability if you're looking for a specific type or size of hose clamp. You can contact Palmer Auto Parts at (989) 588-9007 for more detailed information on their stock.

**USER**: You said Palmer's not open today because it's Sunday, right?

**ASSISTANT**: Actually, Palmer Auto Parts is open on Sundays from 8:30 AM to 1:00 PM【14†source】【18†source】. You should still be able to visit them today to get hose clamps.

**USER**: Oh, but it's already three o'clock here in Michigan.

**ASSISTANT**: Since it's already past the closing time for Palmer Auto Parts, you might want to try other hardware stores that might be open later on Sundays. Larger chain stores like Home Depot or Lowe's often have extended hours, and they typically carry hose clamps. 

If there's a Home Depot or Lowe's nearby, they are likely to be open until 8:00 or 9:00 PM. It's always a good idea to check their specific hours online or give them a call before heading out.

**USER**: Neither are nearby, but they are in Mount Pleasant, which I wasn't wanting to go to today, so I'll probably have to go to Clare, Michigan anyway.

**ASSISTANT**: In Clare, Michigan, there are a few hardware stores you can check out that might have hose clamps. Here are a couple of options:

1. **Clare Hardware**: This local hardware store likely carries a variety of home improvement and automotive supplies, including hose clamps. It's worth calling them to confirm their inventory and hours.

2. **Ace Hardware**: Another reliable option is Ace Hardware in Clare. They typically stock a wide range of hardware and automotive supplies, including hose clamps.

If these stores are convenient for you, they should have what you need. It’s always a good idea to call ahead to make sure they have the specific item you’re looking for.
