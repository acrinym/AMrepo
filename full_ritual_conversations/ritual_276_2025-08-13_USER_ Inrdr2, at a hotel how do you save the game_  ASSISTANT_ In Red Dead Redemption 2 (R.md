## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Inrdr2, at a hotel how do you save the game?

**ASSISTANT**: In **Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2)**, to **save the game at a hotel**, you follow these steps:

### **1. Rent a Room**
- Go up to the **hotel clerk** (usually behind the front desk).
- Select the option to **rent a room** (you’ll pay a small fee, like $1 or so).

### **2. Go to the Room**
- After paying, you’ll be directed to your room. Head upstairs (or wherever it’s located in that specific hotel).

### **3. Use the Bed**
- Walk up to the **bed** inside the room.
- You’ll get a prompt that says something like **“Sleep”** or **“Rest”**.
- Choose a time to sleep (morning, evening, etc.).

### **4. Game Autosaves**
- **Sleeping will trigger an autosave.** While RDR2 doesn’t have manual save points from beds like some RPGs, **the act of sleeping autosaves your progress**.
- You can **also manually save** afterward:
  - Press **Start/Menu**
  - Go to the **Story** tab
  - Select **Save Game**

So: **sleeping in a rented hotel bed triggers autosave**, and you can **manually save right after** to be extra safe.

Let me know if you’re trying to do something specific like a quicksave or story backup!

**USER**: How come you can't do anything with the bath ladies, is there a mod that enables that lol

**ASSISTANT**: iturn0image7turn0image10turn0image12turn0image14In **Red Dead Redemption 2**, the bathhouse interactions are intentionally modest. Even when opting for a deluxe bath, the experience remains limited to light conversation and basic assistance. This design choice aligns with Rockstar's commitment to narrative depth and character integrity, particularly reflecting Arthur Morgan's complex persona.

However, for those interested in expanding or altering these interactions on PC, several mods are available:
