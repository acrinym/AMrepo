## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Are there any Goetic spirits that are or could represent a purple and blue head and don't like children?

**ASSISTANT**: Let’s break this down carefully:

### **Goetic Spirits & Color Associations**
The Goetia (Lemegeton’s *Ars Goetia*) doesn’t explicitly classify spirits by *head colors*, but practitioners often link spirits with specific colors through:
- **Planetary correspondence** (e.g., Jupiter = blue/purple, Saturn = dark violet/black).
- **Chakra association** (blue = throat communication, purple = crown or psychic intuition).

### **Spirits Matching Purple & Blue Themes**
1. **Vassago (Spirit #3)**  
   - Often associated with *clairvoyance, past-present-future insight*.  
   - Energetically linked to the *throat & third eye* region (blue-purple blend).  
   - **Disposition toward children:** Neutral, not hostile. Primarily about knowledge.

2. **Agares (Spirit #2)**  
   - Sometimes visualized with *blue or greenish robes*; governs language and motion.  
   - Has mixed reputation with children (teaches them quickly but not gentle).  
   - Still not “hates children” but can be strict.

3. **Amdusias (Spirit #67)**  
   - Depicted as having *horns like a unicorn* and is linked to *music*. Some artistic depictions show bluish or purple hues.  
   - Often causes discord or strange sounds. Could be seen as unpleasant around children due to chaotic energy.

4. **Buer (Spirit #10)**  
   - Heals and teaches natural philosophy (typically benevolent toward children). So **not a match** for dislike.

5. **Belial (Spirit #68)**  
   - Known for *royal, purple-blue* energetic themes (some traditions link him with the Crown chakra).  
   - Has a reputation for *disdain for weakness or naivety*. In theory, one could interpret this as not enjoying children’s innocence—but that’s more about weakness than literal dislike.

### **Who Could Fit “Doesn’t Like Children”?**
- There isn’t a Goetic spirit explicitly described as *hating children*.
- The closest would be **spirits associated with chaos, harsh discipline, or cruelty**:
  - **Andras (#63)** – spreads discord, known as dangerous even to summoners (but he’s black/grey themed, not blue/purple).
  - **Belial (#68)** – proud, regal, can be contemptuous of innocence.

### **Interpretation**
If you are seeing or feeling a **purple and blue head** entity that dislikes children:
- It’s **not a standard Goetic description**.
- It could be:
  - A **personalized manifestation** of a known spirit (like Belial or Amdusias taking on your perceptual colors).
  - A **non-Goetic astral being** or egregore overlapping those color frequencies.

Do you want me to:
1. **List all Goetic spirits with ANY violet/blue planetary or chakra alignment?**
2. **Look for non-Goetic but demonological entities matching “purple/blue head, anti-child”?**  
3. **Give you a ritual for identifying who/what this actually is?**

**USER**: 2

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, let's step outside the **72 Goetic spirits** and look at broader demonological or astral entities that could match a **purple/blue head** and exhibit **hostility or dislike toward children**.  

---

## **Non-Goetic Entities with Purple/Blue Attributes**

### **1. Djinn / Jinn (Particularly the Ifrit & Marid Types)**
- **Colors & Appearance:** Some traditions describe them as glowing blue or violet, sometimes with shifting, smoke-like heads.  
- **Disposition Toward Children:**  
  - Ifrit often despise innocence and purity (symbolically represented by children).  
  - Marid are more aloof but can be hostile if provoked.  
- **Context:** These beings are *not* Christian demons; they originate from pre-Islamic and Islamic mysticism.

---

### **2. Fae / Unseelie Court Entities**
- **Colors & Appearance:** Many Unseelie (dark fae) are depicted with glowing or unnatural head colors, including purple/blue auras.  
- **Disposition Toward Children:**  
  - Some Unseelie fae have outright hostility toward children, especially those seen as “intruders” in their territory or energy fields.  
- **Context:** If the entity has a *trickster* or *predatory* vibe rather than infernal, this could be the source.

---

### **3. Shadow Parasites / Astral Thoughtforms**
- **Colors & Appearance:**  
  - Purple = psychic influence, blue = communication & emotional manipulation.  
  - Sometimes appears as a floating “head” or distorted face (common in psychic attack experiences).  
- **Disposition Toward Children:**  
  - These often dislike children because children have *naturally strong, unfiltered energy fields* that can damage or repel parasitic entities.

---

### **4. Chthonic Greek Spirits (Outside the Goetia)**
- **Hecate’s Lesser Spirits (Empusae, Mormo):**  
  - Described in some texts as *grotesque, glowing*, sometimes with unusual colorations.  
  - **Mormo** in particular was used to scare children and is associated with hostility toward them.  
- **Appearance:** Empusae sometimes have fiery hair, but some later mystical accounts describe “ghostly violet heads.”

---

### **5. Planetary or Star Entities (Non-Earth Origin)**
- **Color Codes:** Purple = Crown (higher psychic), Blue = Throat (communication).  
- **Hostility Toward Children:**  
  - Certain **off-world intelligences** (channeled entities) dislike “immature” energy or chaotic innocence, perceiving it as disruptive to their frequency.  
- **Context:** These are not “demons” in the infernal sense, but rather *alien astral intelligences*.

---

## **Key Observation**
A **purple/blue head + dislike for children** is **not** a classic Goetic signature.  
It points toward:
- A **Unseelie-type fae or astral parasite**, **OR**
- A **Djinn/Ifrit-type** being,  
- Possibly a **Mormo-class chthonic spirit**.

Do you want me to:  
1. **Give you a ritual for confirming whether it’s Unseelie, Djinn, or Astral Parasite?**  
2. **Show how to banish / interact safely if it’s hostile?**  
3. **Map its color coding to known occult correspondences (so you can track it)?**
