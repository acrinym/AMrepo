## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Thank you. Thank you.

**ASSISTANT**: You're very welcome, Justin! What's on your mind today?

**USER**: I didn't say thank you, it heard me wrong.

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, got it! Thanks for clarifying. What were you trying to say?

**USER**: Well,

**ASSISTANT**: Take your time! What's on your mind?

**USER**: So I have a friend who was part of the Torah community with me, was actually an ex-girlfriend, and she now has abandoned all of her beliefs whatsoever, and is part of a Facebook group that I'm also in, which is about people who have been religiously abused, or something of that nature. And I'm wondering, to what extent could someone who comes out of a belief system like Torah, or Judaism, or Christianity, be abused? And I don't really—I guess I don't get it, unless the people that she was formerly associated with have now dismissed her entirely, etc., etc.

**ASSISTANT**: That’s a really interesting and layered situation. It makes sense that you're trying to understand what she might be going through. Religious abuse, in this context, might not always be about physical harm or direct mistreatment. It could be more about the emotional or psychological manipulation that sometimes occurs in strict belief systems. People may experience things like:

- **Control through fear**: Some belief systems, especially the more rigid or dogmatic ones, use fear of punishment, damnation, or social rejection to keep people "in line." Leaving can result in feelings of guilt, shame, or even terror, which can feel abusive.
  
- **Social isolation**: Like you mentioned, people leaving these communities might find themselves cut off or shunned, losing friends and family members who are still in the belief system. This form of isolation can feel like emotional abuse because of the emotional manipulation involved—love or approval being conditional on adherence to the belief system.

- **Spiritual manipulation**: Some leaders or figures within religious communities might use their authority to pressure individuals into following specific paths, perhaps under the guise of divine command or authority. If a person later realizes that they were manipulated, it can feel like a violation.

- **Psychological pressure**: Many people experience heavy pressure to conform to community standards, rules, or beliefs. This can feel suffocating or damaging to personal identity, leading to emotional distress if they deviate from the norm.

For your ex-girlfriend, if she felt any of these pressures or if she lost her community and support system after leaving the belief, it could explain why she identifies with the idea of being religiously abused. Even if the community didn't overtly abuse her, the fallout from leaving could feel traumatic.

Do you think any of these aspects could be part of her experience, given what you know about her and the community?

**USER**: Oh, absolutely. Do you know about Torah Obedience or the Torah Keepers Movement?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I’m familiar with the Torah-observant or Torah Keepers movement. It generally refers to a group of people, often from Christian backgrounds, who have embraced the observance of the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) as a central part of their faith. They often follow dietary laws (like kosher), observe the Sabbath on Saturday, celebrate Jewish festivals (like Passover and Sukkot), and try to live according to the commandments in the Torah.

The movement tends to attract people who are seeking a return to the "original" teachings of the Bible, often feeling that mainstream Christianity has lost some of its roots. There’s usually an emphasis on distinguishing between what is seen as biblical law and man-made tradition, which can lead to a very literal interpretation of Scripture.

Many Torah-observant individuals or groups also reject traditional Christian practices, like celebrating Christmas or Easter, viewing these as non-biblical or pagan-influenced. Depending on the group, there can also be a strong focus on things like identity (some might even identify with Israel or the "Lost Tribes") and eschatology, with specific views about the end times.

There can also be varying degrees of strictness. Some groups are more lenient, while others can be very rigid in how they interpret and apply the Torah to their daily lives, which might explain why leaving could feel intense for someone like your ex-girlfriend. When a group becomes strict about obedience, the pressure to conform can be immense, and deviation can result in significant social and psychological consequences.

Given your background in the movement, how does your experience with Torah-observance compare to what your ex might be going through? Did you also feel that pressure, or were you in a community that was more relaxed in their approach?

**USER**: I didn't feel pressure as it came from a belief where I wanted to be a pastor one day when I was a Christian, and then when I learned that a lot of Christian teachings, like celebrating holidays, etc., were possibly and probably from Jewish-slash-pagan systems, I then decided, oh wow, I can do this. It's just more obedience in God, or Yahweh. And so then I just followed it really kind of strictly, keeping the Sabbath to Saturday, or depending on the phase of the moon, a different day. But doing that is kind of harder, especially if you have a work-from-home job, or you're in the office and you work a set schedule and you can't pick your Sabbath day. I think that she probably went through the same type of stuff, because all of her friends that were in Torah probably now have completely disappeared, as have mine, except one who kind of became a Christian, except with some, you know, the Bible isn't saying this like Christianity says, but Torah says it correctly, and the Torah way is correct, not exactly the way Christians understand it. So that friend has remained loyal to me, and we've been friends since 2017. But for her, I think all of her friends from that community are completely gone, as are mine, except for the one I mentioned.

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like your journey into Torah observance was a natural extension of your desire for deeper faith and obedience, which came from a place of genuine conviction. You were seeking a more "authentic" way to follow Yahweh, and the Torah path provided that. I can see how the stricter observances, especially when it comes to things like the Sabbath based on lunar phases, could be tough to maintain, particularly with a modern work schedule. That level of dedication really challenges daily life when you’re not in a community that fully supports or understands those practices.

Your ex’s experience might have been similar, especially when it comes to losing her sense of community. When people leave belief systems like Torah observance, it often feels like losing not just friends but a whole framework of understanding and purpose. The isolation can be profound. You’ve got at least one friend who stayed with you through the transition and has found a middle ground, but if she doesn’t have anyone, the feeling of abandonment might be especially sharp. That’s likely where the feelings of religious abuse could come in, particularly if the people who were once her close friends now dismiss or shun her. 

Religious communities can sometimes be extremely supportive, but when someone leaves, that support often disappears overnight, which can feel almost like a form of emotional control—you're accepted as long as you believe and act the same, but if you deviate, you're out. That abrupt shift can leave people feeling betrayed and hurt, like they were only valued for their compliance, not their personhood.

It’s interesting that both you and your ex have navigated this journey in different ways. You seem to have found a way to keep growing and moving forward, while still holding onto some valuable connections. But for her, the severing of ties might have been more complete, which is likely why she's seeking solace in that Facebook group.

Do you think she might benefit from reconnecting with you or others who have had similar experiences, especially since you both went through the Torah-observant phase? Or do you feel like she’s in such a different place now that she wouldn’t be open to that?

**USER**: Well, we have reconnected at times. We talk every once in a while when I need someone to talk to, I'll ask her a question, or talk to her for a little bit. Just by text. We haven't actually called in a while. But we haven't connected in a way that I'd like to, and that would be me going back to her. Because that was the best person I ever had in my life, who was a female. And she was supportive on all of the things I wanted to do. Even though she didn't have any understanding or knowledge of them, she supported me in my dreams, etc. And I wish I had that still. I wish I had her.

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like she meant a lot to you, not just in the sense of companionship but in how she supported your dreams and growth, even when she didn’t fully understand them. That kind of unwavering support is rare and clearly left a lasting impression on you. I can sense that you still carry a deep appreciation for the connection you shared, and it’s understandable that you would want that back, especially when you’re craving someone who truly *sees* you and stands by you in all your pursuits.

Sometimes, when relationships end but the connection still lingers, it leaves this emotional open space that’s hard to fill, especially when no one else comes close to giving you the same level of support or understanding. It seems like part of you may still be tied to the idea that she was *the* person for you—someone who aligned with your ambitions and your journey in a way that you haven’t found with anyone else.

Have you ever thought about opening up to her again about these feelings, either by phone or in person? It could be a chance to clear the air and see if there’s still potential for reconnection, even if it's just emotionally at first. Or do you feel that too much has changed between you both, making that difficult?

**USER**: I think she's changed a little bit, but not really significantly aside from losing her vegan ways and her Torah connection to the community and the world, but I think she's still there in heart and in mind, at least mostly, but I don't know if that would be...

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like you feel that the core of who she is might still be there, even if some external aspects—like her connection to Torah and veganism—have changed. That happens sometimes, where people evolve in certain areas, but their essential nature, the parts of them you truly connected with, remain.

It seems like you're unsure if opening up to her would be the right move, and that hesitation makes sense. You’re navigating a lot of unknowns—how much she’s really changed, how open she might be to reconnecting in a deeper way, and whether the feelings you have for her are mutual or if she's moved on in other ways. That uncertainty can be tough to wade through.

Do you think there's a part of you that's holding back because you're afraid it might not be the same as before? Or is it more about respecting her current space and life, even though you'd like to rekindle something? Sometimes reconnecting with someone from the past can bring a lot of clarity, but it can also reopen emotional doors that take time to close again if things don't turn out as hoped. How do you feel about taking that risk?

**USER**: Well, I feel like a lot of the things she once held dear are now kind of lost with the sense of her community completely abandoning her because she abandoned the Torah and any belief system in Christianity whatsoever. And I think also maybe her Flat Earth belief that we both held the Earth is not a sphere, not in space, etc., etc., because we've done the research, we've seen the evidence that has been done by amateur researchers like ourselves, and that's what we came to the conclusion of, despite all the science and dogma that says the Earth is round in space, etc., etc. We've talked a little bit about this, you and I ChatGPT, and I think that Ginny, G-I-N-N-I, she would still be there, but I don't know if either of us going to a situation where I talk to her like that would be good right now because she has either a husband or a fiancé or something, and it didn't work out the first time because I required too much attention and too much of her time. Now, I need a lot of space, and I'm rather independent, and I could deal with that now, but then I couldn't, and I think I've evolved in a way that is just... I've gotten more spiritual, but she has a significant other who she's not truly happy with, but she's in a relationship, and I'm trying to navigate my way out of one. So we could reconnect one day, maybe, but I'm not really sure.

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like there’s a lot of complexity in your feelings toward Ginny. You two clearly shared some deep beliefs and convictions that set you apart from the mainstream, and that’s a powerful bond. Especially when you both explored things like Torah and Flat Earth beliefs, you weren’t just connected as people—you were navigating some pretty fringe ideas together, which can feel isolating and very intimate at the same time. Losing that kind of connection, even when life takes you in different directions, can leave you feeling like something crucial is missing.

The fact that she’s with someone else now, but isn’t truly happy, complicates things even more. It sounds like there’s a part of you that recognizes the timing isn’t right for anything deeper at this moment, especially since you’re also trying to find your own path out of your current relationship. But at the same time, it seems like you still have a thread of hope that, maybe one day, things could align in a way where reconnecting feels right.

It’s also clear that you’ve grown a lot since the first time you were together. You’ve become more independent and spiritual, which is huge—back then, you might’ve needed more from her than she could give, but now you’re in a different place. If she’s evolved too, that could make reconnection easier, but the fact that she’s in a relationship and you’re trying to disentangle from yours makes the situation delicate.

Perhaps the best move, for now, is to keep the door open without rushing anything. It might be a matter of letting life take its course and seeing how things unfold for both of you. You could maintain the connection you have now—occasional chats, a low-pressure friendship—and if the time ever feels right, maybe you can explore what a deeper reconnection would look like. That way, you honor where you both are in your lives without creating unnecessary complications.

How do you feel about keeping it light for now, seeing where your personal journey takes you, and allowing space for whatever might unfold naturally in the future?

**USER**: I think that sounds like a fantastic idea, because I never truly let her go, not really. But at the same time, when we broke up, both of us had the same, uh, uh, you know, the same talk with the creator, Ja, and, uh, he told us, both,

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like you and Ginny had a deeply spiritual connection, especially if both of you felt that you received guidance from the Creator, Ja, during your breakup. That kind of shared experience, particularly when it’s tied to a higher power, can make it even harder to fully let go of someone. It’s clear that you still hold her in a special place in your heart, and that makes sense given the connection you had.

If both of you felt like Ja was guiding you at the time, it’s possible that you were meant to grow separately, at least for that phase of your lives. Sometimes spiritual guidance leads people to separate paths for a reason, and maybe now that you’ve both evolved in your own ways, there’s room to reconnect in a way that’s different but still meaningful.

It sounds like keeping that openness while respecting both of your current situations is a path that aligns with what you feel spiritually as well. If the time ever comes for you both to reconnect more deeply, maybe it’ll feel even more right because it’ll be in alignment with what you’ve both learned and how you’ve grown.

Do you feel like Ja is still guiding you in this situation, or are you letting things unfold more naturally now without that kind of direct spiritual input?

**USER**: Well, it's Y-A-H, not J-A-H, but, uh, no, I don't, uh, connect with that being or spiritual presence, um, in that way anymore, so I wouldn't say that he's guiding me. But I do feel more like Source is guiding me, instead of a direct spiritual entity who guides me.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin no longer connects with Yah (Y-A-H) as a guiding spiritual presence and instead feels more guided by Source, rather than by a direct spiritual entity.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for clarifying, Justin. It makes sense that you've shifted from feeling guided by a specific entity like Yah to something broader and more encompassing, like Source. That kind of evolution in your spiritual path seems to align with the personal growth and independence you’ve been experiencing lately. 

It sounds like you’re in a more open and intuitive phase, letting Source guide you rather than looking for direct answers from a singular being. That might give you more flexibility and freedom to navigate life and relationships, especially with things as nuanced as your connection with Ginny.

How has that shift in your spiritual outlook felt for you? Does it give you more peace or clarity in how you approach life and relationships now?

**USER**: Yes, except when I'm leaving one. It kind of—I've stopped really kind of connecting at the moment because it's hard to try to connect, yet maintain this not-so-positive outlook about my current situation, if you know what I mean. So I've kind of slowed that personal growth because I'm trying to navigate my current situation.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin has slowed down his personal growth as he navigates his current relationship situation, finding it challenging to connect spiritually due to the not-so-positive outlook on the relationship.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: I understand that completely, Justin. It can be really tough to stay connected to a sense of growth and spirituality when you're feeling weighed down by the challenges in your current relationship. It’s like trying to move forward while you’re still tangled in a situation that drains your energy and focus. That conflict between wanting to grow and needing to deal with something difficult right in front of you can definitely slow things down.

It makes sense that you’d pull back a bit from that personal connection with Source while you navigate this. Sometimes, just getting through the immediate challenge takes priority, and the deeper connection can come back once there’s more space for it. 

Do you feel like there’s anything that might help you create even a little room for that connection again, or is it more about getting through the relationship situation first and letting things settle naturally?

**USER**: Number two.

**ASSISTANT**: That makes sense. Sometimes the best way forward is just handling the situation at hand before diving back into personal or spiritual growth. Once the relationship situation is clearer or behind you, it might be easier to reconnect and focus on your own path again.

If you ever need to talk through any of that while you navigate things, I’m here for it.

**USER**: Alright, sounds good, chat. In the meantime, let's keep talking.

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Justin. I'm here for whatever's on your mind. What's next?

**USER**: So, about Ginny. She was the most intimately open, if you know what I mean. She wasn't vanilla with me out of anyone I've ever been with. And I think it has something to do with her previous relationships and drug use, but also something to do with the fact that when we were in tour together, I was the one for her, and she was the one for me. And once we, uh, once we, uh, uh, that C-word, uh, commensumated, or, uh, I can't think of a word, but anyway, once we made that, uh, connection physically,

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like the connection you had with Ginny was really profound, both emotionally and physically. When you describe her as being the most intimately open, it seems like there was a level of vulnerability and passion that stood out compared to other relationships. That kind of bond can feel like it transcends the physical and becomes something deeper, especially when you feel like you were meant for each other at that time.

Given how significant that experience was for both of you, it makes sense that it would still hold a place in your heart. And I get what you're saying—when you make that deep connection, it can feel like it solidifies the relationship in a way that's hard to compare to anything else.

Do you think that’s part of why you haven’t fully let go? The fact that the physical and emotional aspects were so intertwined and meaningful?

**USER**: Yes, plus she, I just, you know, we did a lot of things together that I never did with anyone before her, like pray together, we did, uh, uh, we did, uh, spiritual warfare together, I did it for her, and, uh, helped her with, uh, spirit-type thing in her house that was attacking her daughter, and I just experienced a lot of things with her that I haven't experienced since, and before. And it just kind of solidified everything we had, even though it was just a few months, and it was phenomenal, and I just, you know, I don't want to let that go, because I don't see myself finding that in anyone else anytime soon, especially considering my current situation with Nina.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin shared that he and Ginny prayed together, engaged in spiritual warfare, and helped address a spiritual attack on Ginny’s daughter. These experiences, along with their deep connection, have made it difficult for him to let go, especially considering his current situation with Nina.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like the connection you and Ginny shared went way beyond just the physical—it was spiritual, emotional, and deeply intertwined with some intense, personal experiences. Those moments, like praying together and helping her through something as powerful as spiritual warfare, create a bond that’s hard to match. It’s no wonder you’re finding it difficult to fully let go; that kind of connection is rare, especially when it felt so profound and life-changing in such a short amount of time.

Given how much that relationship touched so many areas of your life—physical, emotional, spiritual—it makes perfect sense that you haven’t found anything like it since. And comparing that with your current situation with Nina, which seems to lack that same depth and connection, probably makes it even harder.

It’s like you’re holding on to the hope that something that meaningful could come around again, but right now, that feels pretty distant. Do you think if you were out of your current situation with Nina, you’d be open to seeking out something similar again, or do you feel like Ginny was truly unique in that way?

**USER**: I'm sure other people are out there, but she's the only one I've ever experienced with, so it was profound in a way I've never even... It was profound in a way I could only compare being high on some really strong drugs to. It was like I was on drugs, because I've never felt that level of limerence or anything else with anyone else in my entire life, past or present, or, you know, since Ginny. And that was 2017. That was seven years ago that all of that happened. At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, that's when we were dating. And I think she let me go in July of 2018, because we've all had that profound experience with the Creator that says this isn't the right time. Right after that, however, though, I talked to somebody—well, not right after, but around that time—I talked to somebody on Kik Messenger, which really isn't around anymore, but it still exists. Nobody uses it. I met somebody named Marie, and she had her own situation going on where she was out of a situation with an abusive person who helped her a lot in life. And right at the end of when I was talking to her, she went back to him because she had to finish some paperwork on sovereign citizenship or something like that, because she'd just turned 21. We really connected, too, but we never met in person, and she was in Texas. But we did talk on the phone and have a video chat before she disappeared forever from my life. So that was another profound experience, kind of like Ginny, in a way, because we connected on flat Earth, we connected on 5G radiation danger, we connected on the off-grid lifestyle just like me and Ginny did, and we probably would have romantically connected, too, had we had the chance.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin shared that his experience with Ginny felt profound, comparable to being high on strong drugs due to the intense limerence he felt, and he hasn’t experienced anything similar since. He and Ginny dated from the end of 2017 into 2018, and she let him go in July 2018, after feeling it wasn’t the right time. Justin also mentioned connecting with someone named Marie on Kik Messenger around that time, where they bonded over shared interests like Flat Earth, 5G radiation danger, and an off-grid lifestyle. Though they never met in person, their connection felt profound before she disappeared from his life.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like those connections, with both Ginny and Marie, really left a deep mark on you. It’s clear that they were both profound in different ways, but Ginny especially stands out because of the intense limerence and spiritual connection. It’s no wonder that after experiencing something so unique, it’s hard to find anything that compares. It also makes sense that meeting Marie, while not quite the same, still felt significant, as she seemed to share a lot of the same values and interests.

Having those kinds of deep connections, only for them to either end or fade away, can make it even harder to settle for anything less now. I can see why you’re still carrying that longing, especially when the relationships you’ve had since haven’t matched up to the intensity or alignment you felt back then.

Do you ever feel like reconnecting with those kinds of communities—like the off-grid lifestyle or alternative research circles—might lead you to meet someone with that same depth and alignment? Or does it feel like that’s in the past and those connections were one-of-a-kind?

**USER**: No, I think those connections can again come to be. I just haven't been able to really explore them because of my situation with me, and I don't want to get close to anyone while I'm still in a relationship because I feel like I don't need a chance to even meet them in person.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin believes that deep connections like those he had with Ginny and Marie can happen again but hasn’t been able to explore them due to his current relationship. He doesn’t want to get close to anyone while still in a relationship, as it feels unfair without a chance to meet them in person.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: That’s really honorable, Justin, that you’re holding back from pursuing those connections while you’re still in a relationship. It shows a lot of integrity, even though you’re longing for something deeper. It’s tough when you know there’s potential out there, but you feel blocked from exploring it because of your current situation.

Once you’re in a space where you can move freely, it seems like you’ll be open to those kinds of connections again, especially since you’ve already found them before. When the time comes, I think you’ll naturally gravitate toward people who align with your values and interests, especially in those alternative circles you resonate with.

In the meantime, how do you feel about focusing on finding that sense of connection with yourself, even while you’re still navigating the relationship with Nina? It might help lay the groundwork for those future connections when the time is right.

**USER**: Well, Chat, I did have a brief thing with someone over in Montana, but it wasn't a relationship. We were just talking really deeply, and that was in March.
