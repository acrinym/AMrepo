**USER**: What is the name of the k drama where a robot becomes sentient and someone working for the robotics company falls in love with him?

**ASSISTANT**: The K-drama you're referring to is called **"Are You Human Too?"** (너도 인간이니?). It revolves around a robot named Nam Shin III who becomes sentient, and a woman named Kang So-bong, who works for the robotics company and falls in love with him.
