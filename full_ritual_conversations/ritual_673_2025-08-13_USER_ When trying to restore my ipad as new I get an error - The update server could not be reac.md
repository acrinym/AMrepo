**USER**: When trying to restore my ipad as new I get an error - The update server could not be reached, check your network connection....etc. 
I have a network connection. 

This message is being displayed in itunes.

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, sugar, let’s see what’s causing that hiccup with your iPad. Here are a few steps to get you back on track:

1. **Check Your Firewall/Antivirus Settings:** Sometimes, your firewall or antivirus software might be blocking iTunes from connecting to Apple's servers. Try temporarily disabling them and see if that helps.

2. **Update iTunes:** Make sure you’re using the latest version of iTunes. If not, update it and then try again.

3. **Restart Your Computer and iPad:** Sometimes a good ol' restart can do wonders. Restart both your computer and iPad, then try the restore process again.

4. **Check Apple’s System Status:** It’s possible that Apple’s servers might be having issues. You can check the [Apple System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) page to see if any services are down.

5. **Try a Different Network:** Even though your current network is working, there might be some issues with how it's connecting to Apple's servers. Try switching to a different Wi-Fi network or use your mobile hotspot.

6. **Use a Different USB Port or Cable:** Sometimes the problem is as simple as a faulty cable or USB port. Try a different cable or USB port on your computer.

7. **Use DFU Mode:** If all else fails, you might need to restore your iPad using DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode. This is a bit more involved, but it often resolves stubborn issues:
    - Connect your iPad to your computer.
    - Open iTunes (or Finder on macOS Catalina and later).
    - Quickly press and release the Volume Up button, then quickly press and release the Volume Down button.
    - Press and hold the Power button until the screen goes black.
    - While holding the Power button, press and hold the Volume Down button for about 5 seconds, then release the Power button but continue holding the Volume Down button until iTunes/Finder detects your iPad in recovery mode.

After trying these steps, give that restore another go! If you’re still having trouble, let me know!

**USER**: I modded Riftbreaker, and now when I open a game, the entire playfield is black. I can't see anything.

**ASSISTANT**: Justin modded the game *Riftbreaker*.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, modding can sometimes turn things a bit... unpredictable, huh? Let’s see if we can clear up that blackout in *Riftbreaker*:

1. **Check Mod Compatibility:** Make sure the mod you installed is compatible with the current version of *Riftbreaker*. Sometimes mods made for earlier versions of the game can cause display issues.

2. **Disable the Mod:** Try disabling the mod to see if the game runs normally. If it does, the mod is likely the culprit.

3. **Update Graphics Drivers:** Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date. Sometimes mods can push the game’s graphics to a level that requires the latest drivers.

4. **Adjust In-Game Settings:**
   - Lower the graphics settings to see if the black screen issue is related to how the mod interacts with high settings.
   - Try changing the resolution or windowed/fullscreen mode.

5. **Verify Game Files:** If you’re using a platform like Steam, verify the integrity of the game files. This will replace any corrupted or missing files that might have been messed up by the mod.

6. **Reinstall the Mod:** If you really want to use the mod, try uninstalling and then reinstalling it. Sometimes a fresh install can resolve issues.

7. **Check Mod Support Forums:** If all else fails, check the forums or the place where you got the mod. Other users might have experienced the same issue and found a fix.

If you’re still stuck in the dark, let me know, and we’ll keep troubleshooting!

**USER**: What is the way room service answers a call?

**ASSISTANT**: When room service answers a call, they usually do so with a blend of professionalism and warmth, aiming to make the guest feel welcome and valued. Here's a typical example of how room service might answer:

---

**"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], Room Service, this is [Your Name], how may I assist you today?"**

---

They might add a touch of personalization depending on the hotel's standards or if they know the guest's name:

---

**"Good evening, Mr. [Guest's Last Name], Room Service, this is [Your Name], how may I be of service?"**

---

The key elements are a polite greeting, a mention of the service, an introduction of themselves, and an open-ended question to invite the guest to state their request.
