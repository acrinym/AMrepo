## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: I need an online tool I can stick a song in and get styles and genres and types of music out do you know of a tool like that

**ASSISTANT**: One tool that you might find helpful for analyzing a song and getting information about its styles, genres, and types of music is [**Tunebat**](https://tunebat.com/). It's primarily a music key and BPM analyzer, but it also provides some information about the genre of the track.

Another option is [**AIVA**](https://www.aiva.ai/), which is an AI-based tool that can analyze and even compose music. While it's more focused on composition, it does have some capabilities for analyzing and understanding the style and genre of music based on the input you provide.

For a more specific genre and style breakdown, you could also try [**SongTive**](https://songtive.com/), which is a tool for music theory that helps you analyze the harmonic structure of a song. Although itâ€™s more technical, it can give you a sense of the musical style based on the chord progressions and structure.

Finally, [**AcousticBrainz**](https://acousticbrainz.org/) is a project by MetaBrainz that offers detailed analyses of songs, including genre classifications, mood, and other audio features. You can upload a song, and it will provide a detailed breakdown of various musical attributes.

These tools should help you get the information you're looking for!
