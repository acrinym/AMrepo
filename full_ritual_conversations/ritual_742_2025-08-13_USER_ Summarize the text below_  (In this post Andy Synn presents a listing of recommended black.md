**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Summarize the text below:

(In this post Andy Synn presents a listing of recommended black metal albums (or at least blackened ones) for each of the last 10 years, focusing on records and artists that he hasn’t written or read enough about.)

Wonder of wonders, Kerrang (yes, it’s still around) recently published a list of “The 13 Best Black Metal albums of the New Millenium” and… it was actually pretty solid?

I know, I was (pleasantly) surprised too!

And it got me thinking that, since I recently celebrated my tenth anniversary as a writer for NoCleanSinging, now might be a good time to publish my own thoughts on how the black (or, at least, “blackened”) arts have evolved, and endured, over the last ten years.

As far as possible I’ve tried to stay away from the biggest/most notorious names and focus more on those artists/albums which either I didn’t manage to cover myself, or which I feel didn’t get enough wider coverage/attention overall, but that doesn’t mean this article should be interpreted as an attempt to prove who is more “kvlt” (because it’s certainly not me).

What this is is simply a way of celebrating the art of Black Metal, in all its endless vitality and variety while also bringing some much-needed attention to some bands who richly deserve it.

**ASSISTANT**: The author, Andy Synn, reflects on a recent list of top black metal albums published by Kerrang. He plans to share his own perspective on the evolution and endurance of black metal over the past decade. He aims to highlight lesser-known artists and albums that may not have received enough attention. The intention is to celebrate the diversity and vibrancy of black metal while shedding light on deserving bands. This is not an attempt to establish "kvlt" status but rather a celebration of the genre.

**ASSISTANT**: The author, Andy Synn, has compiled a list of recommended black metal albums for each of the last 10 years, highlighting lesser-known artists and records that haven't received sufficient coverage. This idea was sparked by Kerrang's recent list of the best black metal albums of the new millennium. The author aims to celebrate the evolution and endurance of black metal over the past decade, focusing on artists and albums that he hasn't written about extensively. The intention is to shed light on deserving bands and showcase the diversity and vitality of the black metal genre. The author emphasizes that this isn't an attempt to establish "kvlt" status, but rather a means of appreciating the art form and giving recognition to deserving artists.

**USER**: Summarize the text of the Microsoft.com homepage

**ASSISTANT**: As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I can't directly access or view real-time web content such as the current Microsoft.com homepage. However, I can provide you with a general idea of what the Microsoft.com homepage typically includes:

The Microsoft.com homepage is likely to feature a variety of information related to Microsoft's products, services, and initiatives. This could include highlights about the latest software releases (such as Windows or Office), announcements about hardware products (like Surface devices), cloud services (such as Azure), and other technology solutions offered by Microsoft.

The homepage may also showcase news articles, customer stories, and updates about innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and more. There might be sections dedicated to business solutions, developer tools, support resources, and ways to explore and purchase Microsoft products.

Remember that the exact content and layout of the Microsoft.com homepage can change frequently based on updates and promotional campaigns. For the most current and accurate information, I recommend visiting the Microsoft website directly.

**USER**: How can I write a simple program in Q-Basic

**ASSISTANT**: QBasic is an older programming language that was widely used in the past. It provides a simple way to write and execute programs. Here's a step-by-step guide to writing a simple program in QBasic:

1. **Open QBasic:**
   - If you have QBasic installed on your system, open it. If not, you may need to install a DOS emulator or use a virtual machine with an older version of MS-DOS.

2. **Write Your Program:**
   - QBasic uses a line-numbering system. While not required, it's traditional to start with line numbers like 10, 20, 30, etc. You can type the line numbers followed by your program code. For example:
   
   ```basic
   10 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
   20 END
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   - After writing your program, save it with a `.BAS` extension. Then, press the F5 key or type "RUN" to execute your program. The output will appear in the output window.

Here's a slightly more complex example:

```basic
10 PRINT "ENTER YOUR NAME:"
20 INPUT A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 END
```

This program prompts the user to enter their name and then displays a greeting using the entered name.

Remember, QBasic is quite old, and modern operating systems might not natively support it. You might need to use an emulator or a virtual machine to run QBasic programs.

Please note that QBasic is outdated, and modern programming languages offer more advanced features and better tools for development. If you're interested in learning programming, you might want to consider languages like Python, JavaScript, or C# instead.

**USER**: Can you write me a simple program in Freebasic?

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! FreeBASIC is an open-source, modern, and actively-maintained programming language that is compatible with QBasic. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in FreeBASIC:

```basic
Print "HELLO, WORLD!"
Sleep
```

To run this program:

1. **Install FreeBASIC:**
   If you haven't already, download and install FreeBASIC from the official website: https://www.freebasic.net/

2. **Write the Program:**
   Open a text editor (like Notepad) and paste the code above into a new file. Save the file with a `.bas` extension, for example, `hello.bas`.

3. **Compile and Run:**
   Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved your `hello.bas` file. Then, use the `fbc` compiler to compile the program:
   
   ```
   fbc hello.bas
   ```

   This will generate an executable file named `hello.exe` (or `hello` on Linux/macOS).

4. **Run the Program:**
   Execute the compiled program:
   
   ```
   hello
   ```

   You should see the output "HELLO, WORLD!" in the console window.

Remember, FreeBASIC offers a lot more features and capabilities beyond this simple example. It's a versatile language that can be used for various types of programming projects.

If you're looking to explore more complex programming with FreeBASIC, you can refer to their documentation and tutorials: https://www.freebasic.net/wiki/Main_Page

**USER**: What's a good way to get started editing Linux software for beginners? I know it's generally open-sourced software, so I'm looking for an IDE and a beginner's guide to doing so.

**ASSISTANT**: Getting started with editing Linux software for beginners involves selecting a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and learning how to contribute to open-source projects. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

   Choose an IDE that you find comfortable and suits your preferences.

2. **Select a Project:**
   Identify a project you're interested in contributing to. You can start with projects hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Look for projects that are labeled as "beginner-friendly" or have issues labeled as "good first issue" to make your initial contribution smoother.

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Install the chosen IDE on your Linux system.
   - Install the necessary tools and dependencies for the project you're working on. Most projects provide a "README" file with instructions on how to set up the development environment.

4. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use Git (if not already installed, install it) to clone the repository of the project you want to work on. For example:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   
5. **Make Changes:**
   - Open the project in your chosen IDE.
   - Locate the file you want to edit or the issue you want to address.
   - Make your code changes following the project's coding style guidelines.

6. **Test Your Changes:**
   - Run tests if the project has them to ensure your changes haven't introduced issues.

7. **Commit Your Changes:**

     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
     ```

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Push your changes to your fork of the repository:
     ```
     git push origin <branch_name>
     ```
   - On the project's repository, create a new pull request from your fork's branch to the project's main branch. Provide a clear description of your changes.

9. **Participate in the Community:**
   - Engage with the project's community, ask questions, and seek guidance if needed.

10. **Learn and Iterate:**
    - As you gain experience, you can work on more complex tasks and learn from code reviews and discussions.

Remember, contributing to open-source projects is a learning experience, and you'll likely encounter challenges along the way. Be patient, ask for help when needed, and enjoy the process of collaborating with the open-source community.

**ASSISTANT**: Getting started with editing Linux software as a beginner involves choosing the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and learning the basics of working with open-source projects. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Choose an IDE:**
   An IDE makes coding and development more efficient by providing tools like code highlighting, debugging, and version control integration. For editing Linux software, you have several options:

   - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A popular and versatile code editor with excellent support for various programming languages. Install the "C/C++" extension to work with C and C++ code commonly found in Linux projects.

   - **Eclipse:** A powerful IDE with a long history, known for its support for various languages and plugins. The "Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers" package is a good choice for Linux software development.

   - **CLion:** If you're specifically targeting C and C++ development, CLion is a commercial IDE by JetBrains that offers powerful features tailored to these languages.

2. **Install the Required Tools:**
   Depending on the projects you plan to work on, you might need to install development tools and libraries specific to the programming language and project. For C/C++ development, you may need to install packages like `build-essential`, `gcc`, `g++`, and other development libraries using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu, `dnf` for Fedora).

3. **Find an Open-Source Project:**
   Choose an open-source project that interests you and aligns with your programming language skills. Projects are typically hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Look for repositories that have "good first issue" or "beginner-friendly" labels.

4. **Clone the Repository:**
   Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on the code locally and contribute changes back to the project. You can use Git commands or IDE features for this.

5. **Read the Documentation:**
   Each project should have documentation on how to build, run, and contribute to the codebase. Follow the instructions carefully, as they may vary between projects.

6. **Start Small:**
   Begin by understanding the codebase, making small modifications, and gradually increasing your involvement. Fixing typos, improving comments, or adding small features are good ways to get started.

7. **Follow Coding Standards and Guidelines:**
   Projects often have coding standards and guidelines that contributors should follow. Familiarize yourself with these standards to ensure your contributions are consistent with the project's style.

9. **Version Control:**
   Use Git to manage your changes, create branches, and submit pull requests. This is how you contribute your changes back to the project.

10. **Collaboration and Communication:**
    Engage with the project's community. Use platforms like issue trackers, mailing lists, forums, or chat channels to ask questions and communicate with other contributors.

Remember, open-source contribution is a learning process. Start with small steps, be patient, and gradually increase your involvement as you become more comfortable with the codebase and the project's community.

**USER**: Ccaan you tell me why XSccrennsaver, the Linux and Mac X-Server Screensaver module has not been ported to windows?

**ASSISTANT**: As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I do not have real-time or the most up-to-date information. However, I can provide some general insights into why certain software may or may not be ported to different platforms.

XScreensaver is a popular screen saver application for Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS (X11-based systems). The reason why XScreensaver may not have been directly ported to Windows could be due to a variety of technical and non-technical factors:

1. **Platform Differences:** Windows and Unix-like systems have different underlying architectures and APIs. Porting software between these platforms often requires significant effort, especially if the software relies on platform-specific features or interfaces.

2. **X11 Dependency:** XScreensaver is tightly integrated with the X Window System (X11), which is the windowing system used on Unix-like systems. Porting XScreensaver to Windows would likely involve rewriting or adapting large portions of the code to work with Windows' graphics and display systems.

3. **Development and Resources:** Porting software to a new platform requires developers with expertise in both the source and target platforms. It's possible that the XScreensaver development community may not have had the resources or motivation to undertake a Windows port.

4. **Alternative Solutions:** Windows already has its own built-in screen saver functionality, which might lead to less demand for a ported version of XScreensaver. Users on Windows might opt for the native solutions or other third-party screen savers.

5. **Licensing and Open Source Compatibility:** XScreensaver is released under the MIT License, which is open-source and permissive. However, the licensing differences between Unix-like systems and Windows might present challenges when integrating or porting the code.

6. **Maintainer Priorities:** Open-source projects are typically driven by the interests and priorities of their maintainers and contributors. If the maintainers are primarily focused on Unix-like platforms, a Windows port might not be a priority.

It's worth noting that some alternatives may exist for Windows users who are interested in screen savers. Additionally, the landscape of software development is always changing, so it's possible that there have been developments since my last update. If you're interested in using XScreensaver-like functionality on Windows, you might explore other screen saver applications available for that platform.

**USER**: IS X Screensaver based on the X-Server or X-11 Window System?

**ASSISTANT**: XScreensaver is based on the X Window System (often referred to as X11 or simply X). The X Window System is a windowing system that provides the basic framework for creating and managing graphical user interfaces on Unix-like operating systems. XScreensaver was designed to work within the X Window System's architecture.

XScreensaver is a collection of screensavers for X11-based systems, including various Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS. It provides a wide range of visually appealing and often interactive screen savers that activate when a computer has been idle for a specified period.

Since XScreensaver is closely tied to the X Window System, it utilizes X11 libraries and APIs to create and manage its screen savers. This means that XScreensaver is primarily intended for use on Unix-like platforms that support the X11 windowing system.

It's important to note that while XScreensaver is based on X11 and is not natively designed for other windowing systems like those found in Windows or macOS (which use different graphics and display systems). As a result, porting XScreensaver to these platforms would likely require substantial modifications or a complete rewrite of the codebase.
