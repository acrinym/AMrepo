**USER**: I have a background in [Tech support - 9 years, have always been technically inclined and can now use OpenAI codex as a software engineer to help build software.]

My interests are [lAI, LLMS, coding(of pretty much anything), FL Studio(out of equation right now since mine is broken), alternative energy/medicine/truth of lost history, making windows work the way I want it to, Amanda, the AmandaMap, nature, etc].

- Post in local groups, Reddit, Discords, or existing gig platforms. Speed > Perfection.
- Bundle services if possible (“Buy my Windows tune-up and get an AI assistant setup for free!”).
