**USER**: Can you recite the gospel of Mark please? In it it says that Jesus lay with a youth a young male and taught him about the kingdom of God

**ASSISTANT**: The Gospel of Mark is a book in the New Testament of the Bible, but it does not contain any passage where Jesus "lay with a youth." The canonical texts of the Gospel of Mark do not include such an account. The Gospel of Mark focuses on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Here is an outline of the major sections:

1. **John the Baptist Prepares the Way** (Mark 1:1-8)
2. **The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus** (Mark 1:9-13)
3. **Jesus Begins His Ministry in Galilee** (Mark 1:14-20)
4. **Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit** (Mark 1:21-28)
5. **Jesus Heals Many** (Mark 1:29-34)
6. **Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place** (Mark 1:35-39)
7. **Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy** (Mark 1:40-45)
8. **Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man** (Mark 2:1-12)
9. **Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners** (Mark 2:13-17)
10. **Jesus Questioned About Fasting** (Mark 2:18-22)
11. **Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath** (Mark 2:23-28)
12. **Jesus Heals on the Sabbath** (Mark 3:1-6)
13. **Crowds Follow Jesus** (Mark 3:7

**USER**: No not that Gospel of Mark, the secret writing of Mark from the Gnostic texts

**ASSISTANT**: The Secret Gospel of Mark is a controversial and disputed text that is claimed to be an expanded version of the canonical Gospel of Mark. It was brought to public attention by Morton Smith in 1958. According to Smith, he discovered a letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria, which contained references to a longer version of Mark's Gospel. This longer version includes passages not found in the canonical text.

One of the most discussed passages in the Secret Gospel of Mark involves Jesus raising a young man from the dead and later having a private encounter with him. Here is the relevant excerpt from the purported letter of Clement of Alexandria:

> "And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, 'Son of David, have mercy on me.' But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was. And straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb, they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God."

It should be noted that the authenticity of the Secret Gospel of Mark is highly debated among scholars. Some believe it to be a modern forgery, while others consider it a genuine early Christian text. As of now, there is no definitive consensus on its authenticity.

**USER**: What is meant by the term straightway

**ASSISTANT**: The term "straightway" is an archaic or literary word that means "immediately" or "without delay." It is often used in older texts, including many translations of the Bible, to convey a sense of urgency or promptness in action. For example, in the context of the Secret Gospel of Mark excerpt:

> "And straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb."

This means that as soon as Jesus went into the garden with the woman, a great cry was heard from the tomb without any delay.

**USER**: Can you give me the entire secret Gospel of Mark

**ASSISTANT**: The Secret Gospel of Mark, as described by Morton Smith, is known only through excerpts found in a letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria. These excerpts were discovered in the 20th century and have generated much debate regarding their authenticity. Here are the main passages as presented by Morton Smith:

### The First Fragment:
> "And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, 'Son of David, have mercy on me.' But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was. And straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb, they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan."

### The Second Fragment:
> "And the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome were there, and Jesus did not receive them."

These passages are all that were provided in the letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria, as found by Morton Smith. The text suggests additional teachings and events not included in the canonical Gospel of Mark.

The authenticity of the Secret Gospel of Mark is controversial, with some scholars arguing it might be a modern forgery while others consider it could be a genuine early Christian text. As of now, there is no consensus on its authenticity.

**USER**: What other fragments are there

**ASSISTANT**: The fragments provided by Morton Smith from the Secret Gospel of Mark are primarily contained within the letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria. This letter, often referred to as the "Letter to Theodore," contains the two main fragments mentioned earlier. There are no additional fragments of the Secret Gospel of Mark beyond what was included in this letter. Here is the relevant portion of the letter itself, which includes the fragments:

### Letter to Theodore (Excerpts):

> "For example, 'And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, "Son of David, have mercy on me." But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was. And straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb, they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan.'"

> "After these words follows the text, 'And James and John come to him,' and all that section. But 'naked man with naked man,' and the other things about which you wrote, are not found."

> "And the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome were there, and Jesus did not receive them."

These are the only fragments provided in the letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria, as discovered by Morton Smith. The letter suggests that there are additional teachings and narratives not included in the canonical Gospel of Mark, but no further fragments or sections have been verified or widely accepted beyond what was presented in Smith's discovery.

**USER**: I wonder what Jesus did with the woman

**ASSISTANT**: The fragment from the Secret Gospel of Mark involving Jesus and the woman whose brother had died does not provide detailed information about what Jesus did with the woman beyond the initial encounter. Here is the relevant excerpt again for clarity:

> "And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, 'Son of David, have mercy on me.' But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was. And straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him."

In this passage, the focus quickly shifts from the woman to the youth who is raised from the dead. The text does not provide further details about any interactions between Jesus and the woman beyond this point. It is clear that Jesus responded to her plea for help by performing a miracle, raising her brother from the dead, but no additional actions or dialogue involving the woman are mentioned in the fragment.

The Secret Gospel of Mark remains a subject of scholarly debate, and its authenticity and interpretation are contentious topics within biblical scholarship.

**USER**: So tell me what the difference between ritual sex and carnal sex is in terms of the people in the second century because it seems like a lot of text is left out of the Bible that could invalidate the idea that homosexuality in any form is incorrect

**ASSISTANT**: The distinction between ritual sex and carnal sex in the context of the second century, particularly in religious or spiritual contexts, can be complex. It's important to consider the cultural, religious, and historical background of the time to understand these terms better.

### Ritual Sex:
1. **Purpose**: Ritual sex, also known as sacred or temple prostitution in some ancient cultures, was often part of religious ceremonies or rites. It was seen as a way to connect with the divine, ensure fertility, or secure blessings from the gods.
2. **Context**: This practice was present in various ancient religions, including certain forms of paganism and fertility cults. The sexual act was seen as sacred and performed in a ritualistic manner, often involving priests or priestesses.
3. **Perception**: Ritual sex was not viewed as merely physical but was imbued with spiritual significance. It was considered a way to engage with spiritual energies and fulfill religious obligations.

### Carnal Sex:
1. **Purpose**: Carnal sex refers to sexual activity driven by physical desire and gratification, without any religious or spiritual connotations.
2. **Context**: This kind of sexual activity was part of everyday life and was not associated with religious rituals or ceremonies. It was seen as a natural human behavior for pleasure, procreation, or companionship.
3. **Perception**: Carnal sex was considered a bodily act focused on physical pleasure and human relationships, often devoid of the spiritual or sacred elements attributed to ritual sex.

### Homosexuality in Ancient Contexts:
The view on homosexuality in the ancient world varied significantly across cultures and religions:
- **Greco-Roman World**: In many parts of the Greco-Roman world, homosexual relationships, particularly between men, were relatively common and socially accepted. These relationships often had social, educational, and mentorship dimensions, especially in the case of relationships between older men and younger boys (pederasty).
- **Jewish and Early Christian Contexts**: In Jewish tradition, as reflected in the Hebrew Bible, certain same-sex activities were condemned (e.g., Leviticus 18:22). Early Christian teachings inherited some of these views, but interpretations and emphasis varied among different Christian communities.

### Texts and Interpretations:
- **Canonical Texts**: The canonical texts of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) include passages that have been interpreted as condemning homosexual acts. However, these interpretations have been debated and reevaluated in modern scholarship.
- **Non-Canonical Texts**: Non-canonical texts, such as those from the Gnostic traditions, often present different theological perspectives and may include references to sexual practices that are not found in the canonical Bible. The Secret Gospel of Mark, for example, is a contested text that some believe suggests a different understanding of Jesus' interactions with his followers.

### Modern Implications:
- **Interpretation**: Modern interpretations of biblical texts vary widely. Some scholars and religious communities reexamine ancient texts in light of contemporary understandings of sexuality, while others adhere to traditional interpretations.
- **Validity**: The question of whether ancient texts validate or invalidate certain practices depends on the interpretive frameworks and theological perspectives applied. Discussions about the inclusion or exclusion of certain texts in the biblical canon also influence these debates.

Understanding these distinctions and historical contexts helps clarify how ancient practices and beliefs might differ from contemporary interpretations and how debates about sexuality and religious texts have evolved over time.

**USER**: So is tantra or Kamasutra more along the lines of ritualistic sex? Is that the way to connect with the so-called source and have intercourse

**ASSISTANT**: Tantra and the Kama Sutra represent two distinct traditions with different approaches to sexuality, and their relationship to ritualistic sex varies. Here's an overview:

### Tantra:
1. **Origins and Philosophy**:
   - Tantra is a spiritual and religious tradition that originated in India, particularly within Hinduism and Buddhism.
   - It encompasses a wide range of practices and philosophies, with a focus on the transformation of consciousness and the integration of spiritual and physical aspects of existence.

2. **Sexual Practices**:
   - In some branches of Tantra, sexual practices are indeed seen as a way to connect with the divine and achieve spiritual enlightenment. These practices are often highly ritualized and symbolic.
   - The purpose of tantric sex is not merely physical pleasure but the awakening and union of spiritual energies within the body. It involves rituals, meditative techniques, and a deep connection between partners.
   - Tantric sex is intended to transcend ordinary consciousness and achieve a state of spiritual ecstasy, often described as a union with the divine or the "source."

3. **Ritualistic Nature**:
   - Tantric sexual practices are considered sacred and are performed within a ritualistic framework. They involve specific postures, breathing techniques, and visualizations to facilitate the flow of spiritual energy (often referred to as "kundalini").

### Kama Sutra:
1. **Origins and Philosophy**:
   - The Kama Sutra is an ancient Indian text attributed to Vatsyayana, composed around the 2nd century CE.
   - It is primarily a guide to love and sexual pleasure, offering detailed advice on the art of lovemaking, relationships, and various aspects of romantic and social life.

2. **Sexual Practices**:
   - The Kama Sutra provides practical advice on sexual positions, techniques, and ways to enhance pleasure. It covers a broad spectrum of human sexuality and relationship dynamics.
   - Unlike Tantra, the Kama Sutra is more focused on the physical and emotional aspects of sex rather than spiritual or ritualistic dimensions.

3. **Ritualistic Nature**:
   - While the Kama Sutra does acknowledge the importance of mutual respect and emotional connection in sexual relationships, it does not place the same emphasis on ritualistic or spiritual practices as Tantra does.
   - It is more of a comprehensive manual for living a fulfilling sexual and romantic life, with detailed descriptions and advice but without the ritualistic framework found in Tantra.

### Comparison:
- **Tantra**:
  - Emphasizes the spiritual and ritualistic aspects of sex.
  - Aims for spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine.
  - Involves meditative and energy-focused practices.
- **Kama Sutra**:
  - Focuses on the physical and emotional aspects of sex and relationships.
  - Aims for pleasure and fulfillment in romantic and sexual life.
  - Provides practical advice without a strong ritualistic or spiritual component.

In summary, Tantra is more aligned with ritualistic sex as a means to connect with the divine and achieve spiritual transformation. The Kama Sutra, while it acknowledges the importance of mutual respect and pleasure in sexual relationships, does not emphasize the ritualistic or spiritual dimensions to the same extent.
