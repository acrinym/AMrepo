**USER**: What's the best Fortnite strat in the current season? There's I think 3 bots, and we have a trio

**ASSISTANT**: To maximize your chances of winning in Fortnite's current season (Chapter 5, Season 3), here are some strategies tailored to a trio team:

1. **Landing Spots and Early Game**:
   - **Redline Rig** and **Nitrodrome** are key new locations. Redline Rig has Nitro Splash and Nitro Barrels, which provide boosts for vehicles and players. Nitro-drome is ideal for gathering resources and preparing for mid-game engagements.
   - Landing at these locations can help you secure high-value loot and Nitro enhancements early on【6†source】.

2. **Movement and Cover**:
   - Use the Nitro-fied vehicles for rapid repositioning and aggressive plays. Nitro-fied vehicles have increased speed, explosive ramming power, and reduced fuel consumption, making them invaluable for mobility and combat【6†source】.
   - Always stay in cover. Move through buildings and natural cover to avoid being spotted. Using large bushes for concealment can also be effective【7†source】.

3. **Combat Tactics**:
   - Don't rush into fights unnecessarily. Wait for opportunities to third-party weakened enemies after they have engaged in combat with others【7†source】.
   - Use the new **Nitro Fists** for close combat. They allow for powerful combos and aerial attacks, which can give you an edge in close-quarter battles【6†source】.

4. **Weapon Loadout**:
   - Prioritize versatile weapons like the **Combat Shotgun** and **Warforged Assault Rifle** for flexibility in various combat scenarios. The **Boom Bolt** crossbow is also great for taking down vehicles from a distance【6†source】【7†source】.

5. **Team Coordination**:
   - Communication is key. Make sure to call out enemy positions, share resources, and coordinate attacks.
   - Utilize the **Visualize Sound Effects** option in the settings to get visual cues for enemy movements and gunfire, which can enhance your situational awareness and team coordination【7†source】.

By focusing on strategic landing spots, efficient use of cover, careful combat engagement, and strong team coordination, your trio can dominate the current season of Fortnite. Good luck!

**USER**: What is a good trio strat for winning with bots

**ASSISTANT**: When playing Fortnite with bots as part of your trio, it's important to leverage their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. Here are some strategies to help you win:

1. **Landing and Early Game**:
   - Choose landing spots that are less popular to avoid early confrontations. Locations like **Redline Rig** or **Nitrodrome** can provide good loot while giving you time to set up without immediate threats【6†source】.

2. **Resource Gathering**:
   - Take advantage of the bots' ability to gather resources efficiently. Direct them to harvest materials while you focus on securing weapons and strategic positions.
   - Use Nitro-fied vehicles for quick resource gathering and movement. These vehicles offer increased speed and explosive ramming power, which can be useful for quick rotations【6†source】.

3. **Combat Tactics**:
   - Position bots in defensive roles, such as guarding flanks or holding strategic points. Bots can provide covering fire and act as distractions while you and your teammate engage the enemy from better positions.
   - Equip bots with shotguns or SMGs, as they are more effective in close combat situations, where bots can be more predictable and effective.

4. **Building and Defense**:
   - Utilize basic defensive structures like U-shaped walls with ramps to protect your bots and provide them with cover. Bots can struggle with advanced building, so keep structures simple and effective【7†source】.
   - Encourage bots to stay within or around your built structures to ensure they have cover during firefights.

5. **End Game Strategy**:
   - In the final circles, use bots to apply pressure on enemies from multiple angles. Their presence can confuse and split enemy focus, giving you an opportunity to land decisive blows.
   - Keep bots in covered positions and use their firepower to suppress enemies while you maneuver for better positioning or set up ambushes.

6. **Team Coordination**:
   - Maintain constant communication with your teammate to manage bot behavior. Use voice or quick commands to direct bots and adjust their positions as needed.
   - Use the **Visualize Sound Effects** option to keep track of enemy movements and communicate these to your bots to enhance their responsiveness in battle【7†source】.

By focusing on strategic positioning, resource management, and effective use of bots in combat, you can increase your chances of winning Fortnite matches with a trio that includes bots.

**USER**: What's the longest time it took to match make in fortnite

**ASSISTANT**: The longest reported matchmaking time in Fortnite history was 54 hours. This extreme wait time was shared by a player on Reddit, highlighting an unusually long wait likely due to server issues or other anomalies【15†source】【17†source】.

For more context, typical matchmaking times are much shorter, often ranging from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on factors like server load, time of day, and the game mode being played【17†source】.

**USER**: And competitions

**ASSISTANT**: In Fortnite competitions, long matchmaking times have been a significant issue, particularly for high-ranking players. Some reported waiting over 10 minutes to find a match. Epic Games addressed this by updating the tournament matchmaking system to reduce wait times for players with high scores. This update aimed to improve the experience for competitive players, especially during major events like the Winter Royale【23†source】.

Overall, while regular matchmaking can sometimes experience delays, tournament wait times have seen specific improvements to mitigate excessively long waits.
