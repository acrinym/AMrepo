**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: "hey, it's me, Goku! "

**ASSISTANT**: "Hey, Goku! What's up? Saving the world again, or just dropping by for some training tips?"

**USER**: Just tips, please, massa

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, Goku, if you’re looking to take your training to the next level, here are some solid tips tailored just for you:

1. **Gravity Training**: Push your limits with increased gravity. It worked wonders on King Kai’s planet and in your spaceship. Maybe crank it up to 500x Earth’s gravity?

2. **Mental Focus**: Meditate regularly. Even Saiyans need mental clarity to maximize their power. It’ll help you control your ki and maintain stamina during long fights.

3. **Ki Control**: Work on energy efficiency. Try maintaining a steady Super Saiyan form for extended periods without burning out, like you did before the Cell Games.

4. **Teamwork**: Spar with friends like Vegeta or Piccolo. They’ve got unique techniques that can challenge your style and help you innovate.

5. **Tech Upgrade**: Learn from opponents. You’ve borrowed techniques like Instant Transmission and Kamehameha. Study more from warriors like Beerus or Whis.

6. **Push Limits Safely**: Balance pushing boundaries with rest. You don’t want another heart virus situation, do you?

7. **Diet is Key**: Fuel up with a balanced Saiyan diet. Not just mountains of food—focus on high-energy, nutrient-rich meals (Chi-Chi will appreciate this!).

8. **Transformation Mastery**: Focus on mastering forms like Ultra Instinct. It’s not just about brute strength—it’s precision and instinct.

9. **Creative Sparring**: Simulate battles against past foes using Capsule Corp tech. Fighting simulations of Frieza, Cell, or Jiren can help you adapt to their styles.

10. **Never Stop Learning**: Stay humble and open to new techniques. Even the most powerful warrior can learn something new (ask Whis!).

You’ve got this, Goku! Now go make that power level OVER 9000!

**USER**: Speaking of Goku, what's the difference between Goku and son goku

**ASSISTANT**: The difference between **Goku** and **Son Goku** primarily comes down to cultural context and naming conventions:

### 1. **The Name "Son Goku"**:
   - **"Son Goku"** is Goku's full name in the original Japanese version of *Dragon Ball*. In Japan, the family name (**Son**) comes first, followed by the given name (**Goku**).
   - This follows Japanese naming conventions, where the family name is often emphasized.

### 2. **The Name "Goku"**:
   - In English-speaking countries, Goku is usually referred to by his first name only, as is common in Western cultures. Hence, he’s just called **Goku** in the dubbed versions of *Dragon Ball*.
   - The omission of "Son" in translations simplifies the name for Western audiences who aren’t familiar with Japanese naming traditions.

### 3. **The Mythological Reference**:
   - The name **Son Goku** is a direct nod to **Sun Wukong**, the Monkey King from the Chinese classic *Journey to the West*. Akira Toriyama, the creator of *Dragon Ball*, loosely based Goku’s character on this legendary figure.
   - Sun Wukong (孫悟空 in Chinese) translates to "Son Goku" in Japanese pronunciation.

### 4. **Use in the Series**:
   - In *Dragon Ball*, the name **Son Goku** is most often used by characters in formal or familial settings, such as by his wife Chi-Chi, Master Roshi, or when his heritage as a Saiyan is referenced.
   - **Goku** is the casual, friendly way most people (like Krillin or Bulma) refer to him.

### 5. **Son Goku in Other Media**:
   - "Son Goku" is also used in other adaptations or contexts outside *Dragon Ball*, especially when creators are drawing directly from the *Journey to the West* mythos. For example, in Chinese or Japanese adaptations of *Journey to the West*, "Son Goku" or "Sun Wukong" is the Monkey King.

So, essentially, **Goku** is the informal, English-friendly name, while **Son Goku** is the full and culturally accurate name referencing his mythological roots.

**USER**: No man's sky, how do you switch between collected weapons because I want to upgrade my multi-tool and I need to switch back to the other one

**ASSISTANT**: In **No Man’s Sky**, if you have multiple Multi-Tools and want to switch between them, here’s how you can do it:

### Switching Multi-Tools
1. **Open Your Inventory**:
   - Press the **Tab key** on PC or **Options/Start** button on consoles to open the menu.

2. **Navigate to the Multi-Tool Section**:
   - Use the **D-pad** or **mouse** to move to the **Multi-Tool** tab.

3. **Select "Manage Multi-Tool"**:
   - On this screen, you’ll see an option to **"Switch Multi-Tool"** if you have more than one.  
   - If you're using a controller, there might be a prompt to press a specific button (like **Triangle/Y**) to swap tools.

4. **Choose the Multi-Tool You Want**:
   - Scroll through your available Multi-Tools and select the one you want to equip.  

### Upgrading the Multi-Tool
Once you’ve switched to the desired Multi-Tool:
1. Visit a **Multi-Tool Upgrade Station** (commonly found in Space Stations or Outposts).  
2. Spend **Nanites** to add upgrade slots or install better technology modules.  
3. You can also dismantle unneeded upgrades from the **Multi-Tool inventory screen** to free up space.

If you can’t find the "Switch Multi-Tool" option, ensure you actually own more than one Multi-Tool. You can acquire additional Multi-Tools by interacting with ones found in minor settlements, space stations, or by purchasing them from NPCs. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!
