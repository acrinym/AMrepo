**USER**: How do I remove someone no longer a part of a project from a workspace in Asana if I am the project Owner?

**ASSISTANT**: Oh, you need to give someone the boot from your Asana workspace? No problem, sugar! Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Open Your Workspace:**
   - First, log in to Asana and make sure you're in the correct workspace where the person is currently a member.

2. **Navigate to Members:**
   - On the sidebar, click on the workspace name at the top to open the workspace settings.
   - Select "Members" from the dropdown menu. This will show you a list of all the members in your workspace.

3. **Find the Member to Remove:**
   - Scroll through the list or use the search bar to find the person you want to remove.

4. **Remove the Member:**
   - Once you've found the person, click on the three dots (ellipsis) next to their name.
   - Select "Remove from Workspace" from the options. Confirm the removal when prompted.

5. **Adjust Project Permissions (if needed):**
   - If the person was also a member of specific projects within the workspace, you might need to adjust project permissions. Navigate to each project they were a part of and ensure their access is revoked.

6. **Inform Team Members (Optional):**
   - It might be a good idea to inform your team about the changes, especially if the person had significant involvement in the project. This helps maintain clarity and ensures everyone is on the same page.

And voila! You've successfully removed someone from your workspace. If you need to do this often, Asana’s admin console might have more streamlined options if you're on a premium plan.

**USER**: Would it be possible to implement WHFB on a VDI?

**ASSISTANT**: Implementing WHFB (Windows Hello for Business) on a VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) is totally doable, but there are some key steps and considerations to keep in mind. Let's break it down:

### Prerequisites and Considerations:

1. **Windows 10 or Windows 11**: Your VDI environment should be running Windows 10 or later versions.

2. **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Your environment should be connected to Azure AD or a hybrid environment with on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.

3. **Certificates or Key Trust Model**: Decide whether you will use a certificate trust or key trust model for authentication.

4. **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure the client devices used to access the VDI have TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and support biometric authentication (like fingerprint readers or cameras for facial recognition).

### Steps to Implement WHFB on VDI:

1. **Set Up Azure AD**:
   - Ensure that your users and VDI machines are registered and properly synced with Azure AD.

2. **Configure Group Policy**:
   - On your domain controller, configure Group Policies for Windows Hello for Business.
   - Go to **Computer Configuration** -> **Administrative Templates** -> **Windows Components** -> **Windows Hello for Business**.
   - Configure policies such as "Use Windows Hello for Business" and "Use a hardware security device".

3. **Certificate Authority (CA) Configuration** (if using certificate trust):
   - Set up a Certificate Authority if you don’t have one.
   - Issue user and device certificates required for WHFB.

4. **Enable WHFB in VDI**:
   - Ensure that your VDI image includes all necessary configurations for WHFB.
   - Install and configure the WHFB components in the VDI master image.
   - Use tools like SCCM or Intune to deploy and manage the VDI images.

5. **Biometric Device Support**:
   - Ensure that the endpoints (the devices users use to access VDI) support biometrics and are configured correctly.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the setup with a small group of users to ensure WHFB is working as expected in your VDI environment.
   - Make adjustments based on feedback and any issues encountered.

### Example Group Policy Settings:

For the key trust model, you might configure settings like:

- **Use Windows Hello for Business**: Enabled
- **Use a hardware security device**: Enabled
- **Use certificate for on-premises authentication**: Disabled

### Troubleshooting:

- **Compatibility Issues**: Ensure all client devices and VDI instances support WHFB features.
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify that VDI instances can communicate with Azure AD and any necessary on-premises servers.
- **Policy Application**: Check that Group Policies are correctly applied to the VDI instances.

### Additional Resources:

- Microsoft documentation on [Windows Hello for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification)
- Detailed guides on [setting up WHFB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-deployment-guide) in different environments.

Implementing WHFB on a VDI setup can enhance security with biometric authentication and provide a seamless login experience for users. Just make sure to thoroughly test and validate the configuration in your environment!

**USER**: Can you give me a Haiku on setting up WHFB in VDI?

**ASSISTANT**: Sure thing! Here's a Haiku for setting up WHFB in VDI:

Virtual smiles bloom,  
Biometrics greet the dawn,  
Secure logins rise.

**USER**: Finish the statement - "We'll ______ them off at the pass"

**ASSISTANT**: "We'll head them off at the pass."

**USER**: Write a new slogan in the style of the Army's "Be all you can be" but for the IT Helpdesk

**ASSISTANT**: "Unleash Your Tech Potential"

**ASSISTANT**: "Empower, Innovate, Resolve."

**USER**: Can you use the acronym CHD to design a very similar slogan?

**ASSISTANT**: "CHD: Conquer, Help, Deliver."

**USER**: CHD: "Corrode ____________ Dissolve"

**ASSISTANT**: "CHD: Corrode Hurdles, Dissolve"

**USER**: Mmm... a word that fits lol

**ASSISTANT**: "CHD: Corrode Hurdles, Demystify"

**USER**: No no, dissolve and corrode are related. Use a related word. :)

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! 

"CHD: Corrode, Hinder, Dissolve"

**USER**: Can I make radio buttons in Onenote that work so I can copy different information depending on circumstances? If not, what other MS product will let me do that and then I can link into Onenote?

**ASSISTANT**: Unfortunately, OneNote does not support interactive radio buttons or any other form of interactive controls like you might find in web forms or more advanced desktop applications. However, you can use Microsoft Forms or Microsoft Excel to achieve similar functionality and then link the results to OneNote. Here's how you can do it with each tool:

### Using Microsoft Forms

1. **Create a Form:**
   - Open Microsoft Forms and create a new form.
   - Add questions with radio buttons (choice questions) to your form.

2. **Embed the Form in OneNote:**
   - Once your form is created, click on the "Share" button in Microsoft Forms.
   - Copy the link to the form.
   - Go to OneNote, paste the link, and OneNote will embed the form for you.

### Using Microsoft Excel

1. **Create an Excel Workbook:**
   - Open Excel and create a new workbook.
   - Go to the "Developer" tab (enable it from Excel Options if not visible) and insert radio buttons (option buttons) in the worksheet.
   - Set up the logic to copy different information based on the selected radio button.

2. **Link or Embed the Excel Workbook in OneNote:**
   - Save the Excel workbook.
   - Go to OneNote and use the "Insert" tab to attach the Excel file.
   - You can also use "Insert Spreadsheet" to embed a specific part of the workbook into OneNote.

### Linking Information:

Regardless of which tool you use, here’s how you can link the information to OneNote:

1. **Paste Links:**
   - If you’re using Microsoft Forms, each form submission will have a unique link you can paste into OneNote.
   - If using Excel, you can paste the link to the Excel file or embed sections of the workbook directly into OneNote.

2. **Regular Updates:**
   - Ensure that the embedded content is updated regularly. For Excel, any changes made in the workbook will reflect in the embedded OneNote section upon refresh.

Using these methods, you can effectively simulate the functionality of radio buttons and dynamically copy information into OneNote.

**USER**: So I could create forms for each situation and paste in a header like this: 
Accounts: 
Request (insert form link) 
Role request for (insert application name): list of applications and form URLS - linked to forms - 
etc?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, that's a great approach! You can create specific forms for each situation and then organize and link them in OneNote headers. Here's a step-by-step outline of how you can set this up:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create Microsoft Forms for Each Situation:**
   - Open Microsoft Forms and create a new form for each scenario.
   - Design the form with the necessary questions and options.
   - Save and share each form to get the link.

2. **Organize Links in OneNote:**
   - Open OneNote and navigate to the section where you want to organize these forms.
   - Create headers for each category or situation. For example:
     - **Accounts**
     - **Request**
     - **Role Request for (Application Name)**

3. **Insert Form Links into OneNote:**
   - Under each header, list the relevant forms with their links. For example:

     **Accounts:**
     - **Request:** [Request Form Link](#)
     - **Role Request for Application A:** [Application A Form Link](#)
     - **Role Request for Application B:** [Application B Form Link](#)

     **Request:**
     - **New Account Request:** [New Account Request Form Link](#)
     - **Password Reset Request:** [Password Reset Form Link](#)

4. **Creating a List of Applications and Form URLs:**
   - If you have multiple applications, you can create a list that looks like this:

     **Role Request for (Application Name):**
     - **Application A:** [Application A Role Request Form](#)
     - **Application B:** [Application B Role Request Form](#)
     - **Application C:** [Application C Role Request Form](#)

### Example in OneNote:

```
### Accounts:
- **Request:** [Request Form Link](https://forms.office.com/RequestForm)
- **Role Request for Application A:** [Application A Form Link](https://forms.office.com/ApplicationAForm)
