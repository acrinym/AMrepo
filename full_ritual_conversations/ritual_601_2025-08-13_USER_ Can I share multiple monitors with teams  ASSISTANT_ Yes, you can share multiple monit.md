## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: Can I share multiple monitors with teams

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can share multiple monitors with Microsoft Teams, but it depends on how you approach screen sharing. Teams does not have a built-in feature to share multiple monitors simultaneously within a single sharing session, but here are ways to achieve this:

### 1. **Switch Between Monitors**
   - You can manually switch which monitor is being shared by stopping the current share and starting a new one with the other monitor. This is straightforward but not simultaneous.

### 2. **Share Desktop for Each Monitor**
   - If you have multiple monitors, you can share a specific monitor's entire desktop instead of individual applications.
   - To share a specific monitor:
     1. Click **Share Content** in Teams.
     2. Choose the desired monitor from the list (each monitor will appear as an option).

### 3. **Use Third-Party Software or Tools**
   - You can use screen management or presentation software (e.g., OBS Studio or dual-monitor management tools) to combine multiple monitors into one virtual display and then share that virtual display in Teams.
   - Alternatively, you can share your entire desktop and adjust the Teams meeting window to display across multiple monitors for participants.

### 4. **Join the Meeting from Two Devices**
   - Log in to the same Teams meeting from two devices or instances (e.g., a laptop and a PC).
   - Share one monitor from each device, allowing simultaneous sharing from both.

### 5. **Share a PowerPoint Presentation Spanning Multiple Monitors**
   - If you are presenting slides that span multiple monitors, share your desktop instead of the PowerPoint application directly. Ensure the presentation spans both monitors before sharing.
