If you'd like a detailed guide or a video tutorial specific to this model, I can look one up for you. Let me know!

**USER**: So I moved my c drive or actually my d drive to an ssd, but the SSD that was an nvme that's already in my system is only 120 gigs. That contained my c drive which I didn't realize. So when I put the SSD in my system, the c drive is still on the nvme but the d drive no longer exists because I took it out of the system. That was only one terabyte. Now the d drive on my system is the system underscore drv and there's a copy of Windows on the SSD that I just put in the system. Also the wind recovery drive is visible and it's the system underscore drv, and I don't want either of those visible except to partitioning applications. How do I fix this mess? I didn't think I was upgrading the d drive which was the drive I actually took out of the system. That drive no longer has a drive letter because the d drive which was the nvme was taken over by system_drv

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like there’s some confusion with the drive assignments, Windows installations, and visibility of system partitions. Here’s how to fix and clean up this situation:

---

### **Step 1: Verify the Current Disk Setup**
1. **Open Disk Management**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, and press Enter.
   - Review all disks, partitions, and drive letters.
   - Note which drive is the **NVMe SSD** (120 GB with the current C: drive), the **1 TB SSD** (previous D: drive), and the **new SSD**.

2. **Confirm Windows Boot Disk**:
   - Right-click on the C: drive (on the NVMe) and check if it’s labeled as **Boot** or **System**.
   - If the wrong partition is marked as Active/System, we’ll correct it later.

---

### **Step 2: Assign the 1 TB SSD as D Drive**
1. Identify the 1 TB drive (the one you removed and now reinstalled) in Disk Management. If it’s not showing:
   - Click **Action** > **Rescan Disks**.
   - If it appears but doesn’t have a drive letter, right-click on it, choose **Change Drive Letter and Paths**, and assign it **D:**.

---

### **Step 3: Hide the `System_Drv` and Recovery Partitions**
1. In Disk Management, locate the **System_Drv** and Recovery partitions.
2. Remove their drive letters:
   - Right-click on the partition, select **Change Drive Letter and Paths**, and choose **Remove**.

These partitions will remain functional and visible to partitioning tools but will not show up in File Explorer.

---

### **Step 4: Fix Duplicate Windows Installation**
1. To prevent confusion between the two Windows installations:
   - Boot into the Windows installation you want to keep (on the 120 GB NVMe SSD or the new SSD).
   - Open **System Configuration** (`Windows + R`, type `msconfig`, and press Enter).
   - Go to the **Boot** tab and remove the entry for the unwanted Windows installation.

2. **Optional Cleanup**:
   - If the old Windows installation on the new SSD is no longer needed, you can format that drive or delete its Windows-related files (e.g., `Windows`, `Program Files`, `Users` folders).

---

### **Step 5: Ensure Correct Boot Priority**
1. Reboot and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (`F2`, `Del`, or the key specific to your system).
2. Set the 120 GB NVMe SSD (or your preferred boot drive) as the first boot device.

---

### **Step 6: Recheck and Test**
1. Boot into Windows and confirm:
   - C: is your primary OS drive.
   - D: is your 1 TB data drive.
   - System_Drv and Recovery partitions are hidden.

2. Verify storage using Disk Management to ensure everything is as desired.

---

### **Optional: Clone D Drive Properly**
If you intended to migrate the data on the 1 TB SSD (D:) to the new SSD, you can use cloning software like **Macrium Reflect** or **AOMEI Backupper** to properly transfer the data, maintaining the same drive letter and partition structure.

---

If you need further clarification or encounter specific errors during these steps, let me know!

**USER**: It seems that Windows also doesn't know about my external drive that's plugged in via USB, which is the one I copied to the SSD inside my computer now. The one that's external in the USB used to be the d drive and I'll have to copy all the contents to the new SSD empty partition which has no drive letter at the moment. That should fix things, mostly. But the part I don't really understand is how the nvme that's in my computer made a copy of windows so there's two drives containing Windows now or to drive letters containing windows, one of them is on the nvme and one of them is on the new SSD that I just installed. I don't want windows on the ssd, I just want it on the nvme

**ASSISTANT**: To address your situation and clean up the setup while keeping Windows on the NVMe drive and removing it from the new SSD, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Reconnect and Verify the External Drive**
1. **Ensure External Drive Is Recognized**:
   - Plug the external drive back in and check if it appears in **Disk Management** (`Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, press Enter).
   - If it doesn’t appear, disconnect and reconnect the drive. If it still doesn’t show, try a different USB port or cable.
   - If it appears but lacks a drive letter, assign a letter by right-clicking the drive > **Change Drive Letter and Paths** > **Add**.

2. **Copy Data from the External Drive to the SSD**:
   - Once the external drive is recognized, copy its contents to the partition on the new SSD that currently has no drive letter.
   - Use **File Explorer** for the transfer or tools like **Robocopy** if you want a reliable and fast copy with error handling.

---

### **Step 2: Confirm the Bootable Windows Installation**
1. **Determine Which Drive is Booting Windows**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `msinfo32`, and press Enter.
   - Under **System Summary**, check the value for **Boot Device**. This will confirm whether your NVMe drive or the new SSD is the active boot drive.

2. **Verify Drive Content**:
   - Open File Explorer and navigate to both C: (NVMe) and the new SSD.
   - Look for Windows installation folders (`Windows`, `Program Files`, etc.) on both drives.
   - Ensure the NVMe drive is the active boot drive (it should have these folders), while the SSD shouldn’t contain these files.

---

### **Step 3: Remove Windows from the New SSD**
To avoid issues caused by having two copies of Windows:

1. **Delete the Windows Installation on the SSD**:
   - Open **Disk Management**.
   - Right-click the partition on the new SSD containing Windows (be cautious to select the correct partition) and choose **Format** or **Delete Volume**.
   - This will erase all data on the partition and free up space for other use.

2. **Reassign Unallocated Space**:
   - After deleting the Windows partition, you can extend an adjacent partition or create a new partition for data storage on the SSD.

---

### **Step 4: Hide System Partitions**
1. In **Disk Management**, locate the `System_Drv` and Recovery partitions.
2. Right-click each partition and select **Change Drive Letter and Paths** > **Remove**.
   - This makes the partitions invisible in File Explorer while keeping them functional.

---

### **Step 5: Set NVMe as the Boot Device**
1. **Enter BIOS/UEFI**:
   - Restart your system and enter BIOS/UEFI settings (press `F2`, `Del`, or a similar key during startup).

2. **Set Boot Priority**:
   - Ensure the NVMe drive is set as the first boot device.
   - Save changes and exit.

---

### **Step 6: Assign Proper Drive Letters**
1. Open **Disk Management** again.
2. Assign appropriate drive letters to the partitions:
   - Assign D: to the new SSD partition after copying data.
   - Keep the NVMe as C: and ensure the external drive (if needed) gets a new letter.

---

### **Step 7: Verify Configuration**
1. Reboot the system and confirm that:
   - Windows boots from the NVMe.
   - The new SSD is a data drive.
   - External drives are recognized and accessible.
   - `System_Drv` and Recovery partitions are hidden.

---

### Additional Notes:
- **Why Two Windows Copies Exist**:
   - Likely during the cloning process or setup, the Windows installation on the NVMe was copied to the new SSD, resulting in two installations.
   - Deleting the Windows files from the new SSD (Step 3) resolves this duplication.
  
- **Prevent Future Issues**:
   - Always confirm which drives contain bootable installations before installing or cloning drives.
   - Label your drives in Disk Management for easy identification.

Let me know if you need clarification or run into issues during any of these steps!

**USER**: So I removed the extra copy of Windows and formatted that drive, but now when I try to use the new SSD that I just installed and format the unallocated space to create the d drive, I create a volume using the windows discs and volumes applet and it acts as if it creates it and then doesn't do anything.

**ASSISTANT**: If Windows Disk Management is not properly formatting the unallocated space and creating a usable volume on your new SSD, here’s how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Step 1: Verify the New SSD**
1. **Open Disk Management**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, and press Enter.
   - Locate the new SSD (the unallocated space should be visible).

2. **Check the SSD's Status**:
   - Right-click the disk (not the partitions, but the disk label like "Disk 1") and select **Properties**.
   - Look under the **Volumes** tab for the partition style:
     - **MBR (Master Boot Record)** or **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**.
   - If no partition style is listed, it means the drive is not initialized.

3. **Initialize the Disk** (if needed):
   - Right-click the disk and select **Initialize Disk**.
   - Choose **GPT** if your system uses UEFI, or **MBR** for older systems.
   - After initialization, the unallocated space will be ready for partitioning.

---

### **Step 2: Create a New Volume**
1. Right-click the unallocated space on the new SSD and select **New Simple Volume**.
2. Follow the wizard:
   - Assign a drive letter (e.g., **D:**).
   - Choose **NTFS** as the file system and leave the allocation unit size as **Default**.
   - Check the box for **Perform a quick format**.

3. Complete the process and verify that the drive appears in **File Explorer**.

---

### **Step 3: If the Volume Still Doesn’t Appear**
If Disk Management doesn’t create the volume properly, there may be an issue with the partition table or the drive itself.

#### **Option 1: Use Diskpart (Command Line Tool)**
1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - Type `diskpart` and press Enter.

2. **List and Select the Drive**:
   - Type `list disk` and press Enter to see all disks.
   - Identify the new SSD (by size).
   - Type `select disk X` (replace **X** with the disk number of your new SSD) and press Enter.

3. **Clean the Disk**:
   - Type `clean` and press Enter. This will remove all existing partitions and data.

4. **Create a New Partition**:
   - Type `create partition primary` and press Enter.
   - Type `format fs=ntfs quick` and press Enter to format the partition as NTFS.
   - Type `assign letter=D` and press Enter to assign the drive letter **D**.

5. **Exit Diskpart**:
   - Type `exit` and press Enter to close Diskpart.
   - Check File Explorer to verify the new drive.

---

#### **Option 2: Use Third-Party Partitioning Tools**
If Disk Management or Diskpart doesn’t work, use a third-party tool like:
- **MiniTool Partition Wizard** (free version).
- **EaseUS Partition Master** (free version).
- **AOMEI Partition Assistant** (free version).

These tools often handle partitioning issues better than Windows native tools.

---

### **Step 4: Check for Hardware or Driver Issues**
1. **Update SSD Firmware**:
   - Check the manufacturer's website for firmware updates for your SSD.

2. **Update Storage Drivers**:
   - Open **Device Manager** (`Windows + X`, then click **Device Manager**).
   - Expand **Disk Drives**, right-click your SSD, and select **Update Driver**.
   - Choose **Search automatically for drivers**.

3. **Run Hardware Diagnostics**:
   - Use tools like **CrystalDiskInfo** to check the health of the SSD.
   - If the drive has errors, it may need to be replaced.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Write Permissions**
1. **Check Volume Permissions**:
   - After creating the volume, right-click the new drive in **File Explorer** and select **Properties** > **Security**.
   - Ensure your user account has **Full Control** permissions.

2. **Disable Disk Write Protection**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Type `diskpart` and press Enter.
   - Select the disk using `select disk X` (replace **X** with the SSD number).
   - Type `attributes disk clear readonly` and press Enter.
   - Exit Diskpart and retry formatting.

---

### **Step 6: Test the Drive**
If none of the above steps work, the SSD may be faulty. Try testing the drive:
- **On another computer**: Install the SSD and attempt to format it.
- **With a different connection**: If it's an external SSD, try a different USB port or cable.

Let me know how these steps work for you!

**USER**: Why can't initialize the drive cuz that's the one that contains Windows now since I just wiped Windows off of the drive inside the computer already

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, I see what happened now: the new SSD you installed is already being used as a system drive since you wiped Windows off the original internal drive. If that drive currently contains Windows, you can't initialize or format it because it's actively in use as the **system/boot drive**. To resolve this situation while keeping Windows on the NVMe drive (not the new SSD), you need to carefully reconfigure the setup. Here's the step-by-step guide:

---

### **Step 1: Ensure the NVMe Drive Still Has Windows**
1. **Verify Boot Configuration**:
   - Check if the NVMe drive still has the Windows installation intact (it should have the `C:\Windows` directory).
   - If it does not, you may need to **reinstall Windows** on the NVMe drive.

2. **Boot from the NVMe**:
   - Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI (usually by pressing `Del`, `F2`, or `Esc` during boot).
   - Set the **NVMe drive** as the first boot device in the boot priority list.
   - Save changes and reboot.

3. **Verify Which Windows Installation is Active**:
   - After booting, open **System Information** (`Windows + R`, type `msinfo32`, and press Enter).
   - Check the **Boot Device** under System Summary. It should point to the NVMe drive.

---

### **Step 2: Remove Windows from the New SSD**
Since the new SSD contains an unwanted copy of Windows, it is currently preventing you from formatting it or using it for data. To remove Windows safely:

1. **Boot from the NVMe Drive**:
   - Confirm you’re booted into the Windows installation on the NVMe drive.

2. **Delete Windows on the New SSD**:
   - Open **Disk Management** (`Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, and press Enter).
   - Identify the new SSD in the list.
   - Right-click its partitions (e.g., the one containing Windows) and choose **Delete Volume**.

3. **Format the New SSD**:
   - Right-click the unallocated space and select **New Simple Volume**.
   - Follow the wizard to format the drive as NTFS and assign a drive letter (e.g., **D:**).

---

### **Step 3: Hide System Partitions**
If the new SSD still contains system partitions (e.g., EFI or Recovery), you can remove their drive letters to prevent them from appearing in File Explorer:

1. In **Disk Management**, locate the **System_Drv** or Recovery partitions.
2. Right-click each and select **Change Drive Letter and Paths** > **Remove**.

This will hide the partitions while keeping them functional for the bootloader, if needed.

---

### **Step 4: Reconfigure the Bootloader (Optional)**
If the system still tries to boot from the new SSD instead of the NVMe drive:

1. **Use BCDEdit to Adjust Boot Entries**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Type `bcdedit` and press Enter to view the current boot configuration.
   - Identify the entry for the new SSD's Windows installation and note its identifier (e.g., `{current}` or a long GUID).
   - Remove the unwanted entry:
     ```cmd
     bcdedit /delete {identifier}
     ```
   - Replace `{identifier}` with the correct value from the `bcdedit` output.

2. **Rebuild the Boot Configuration (if needed)**:
   - If the system struggles to boot, use a Windows installation media to repair the bootloader:
     - Boot from the Windows installation USB.
     - Select **Repair your computer** > **Troubleshoot** > **Advanced options** > **Command Prompt**.
     - Run:
       ```cmd
       bootrec /fixmbr
       bootrec /fixboot
       bootrec /scanos
       bootrec /rebuildbcd
       ```

---

### **Step 5: Copy Data to the New SSD**
Now that the new SSD is formatted and Windows is fully removed, you can copy data from your external drive or other sources to the new SSD.

---

### **Step 6: Test and Verify**
1. **Reboot the System**:
   - Confirm the NVMe drive is the active boot drive.
   - Verify the new SSD is functional and accessible in File Explorer.
   - Ensure system partitions (e.g., Recovery, System_Drv) are hidden.

2. **Clean Up**:
   - Remove any lingering bootloader entries for the new SSD in `msconfig` > **Boot** tab.
   - Run `diskmgmt.msc` one last time to ensure partitions and drive letters are correctly assigned.

---

### Key Notes:
- If you're unable to boot from the NVMe drive, you may need to reinstall Windows on it using installation media.
- Be cautious when deleting partitions—ensure you're only affecting the new SSD and not the NVMe or other drives.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

**USER**: Oh yeah, I changed UEFI to be secondary boot even though it's still booting I said that in CMOS

**ASSISTANT**: Changing the UEFI boot mode to secondary in your BIOS/CMOS settings can lead to some unintended consequences, especially if your system is configured to prioritize a certain boot mode (e.g., UEFI or Legacy). Let’s address your situation to ensure everything works properly.

---

### **Why It Matters**
- **UEFI Boot Mode**: UEFI is the modern standard for booting, offering faster startup times and support for larger drives (>2 TB) and GPT partitioning.
- **Legacy Boot Mode**: This is used for older systems or drives formatted with MBR.

If your system is still booting after making UEFI secondary, it's likely defaulting to Legacy Boot or a backup UEFI configuration. However, this setup might cause issues with certain drives or partitions not being recognized.

---

### **How to Fix This Setup**
To restore proper functionality and ensure everything boots correctly:

#### **Step 1: Set UEFI as Primary Boot Mode**
1. **Enter BIOS/CMOS Settings**:
   - Restart your computer and press the key to enter BIOS/CMOS (usually `Del`, `F2`, or `Esc` during startup).
   
2. **Locate Boot Mode Settings**:
   - Look for an option labeled **Boot Mode**, **UEFI/Legacy Boot**, or similar.
   - Ensure **UEFI** is set as the **primary** or default boot mode.

3. **Save and Exit**:
   - Save the changes (often `F10`) and reboot.

---

#### **Step 2: Ensure NVMe Drive Is the Boot Device**
1. **Adjust Boot Priority**:
   - Still in the BIOS, go to the **Boot Order** or **Boot Priority** section.
   - Set the NVMe drive as the **first boot device**.

2. **Disable Boot Options for Other Drives** (Optional):
   - If you still have the new SSD or external drive connected, make sure they are not listed in the boot order (or move them below the NVMe drive).

---

#### **Step 3: Verify Partition Style**
1. **Check Disk Partitioning**:
   - Open **Disk Management** in Windows (`Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, press Enter).
   - Right-click the NVMe drive and select **Properties** > **Volumes**.
   - Confirm that the partition style is **GPT** (not MBR). GPT is required for UEFI.

2. **Convert Partition Style** (if needed):
   - If the NVMe drive is using MBR, you’ll need to convert it to GPT. This step will require wiping the drive, so backup your data first:
     - Use a tool like **Disk Management**, **Diskpart**, or third-party software (e.g., AOMEI Partition Assistant) to convert it.
     - Reinstall Windows on the NVMe after conversion.

---

#### **Step 4: Cleanup and Test**
1. **Test Booting**:
   - Reboot the system and ensure it boots from the NVMe drive in UEFI mode.
   - Check the boot drive in **System Information** (`Windows + R`, type `msinfo32`).

2. **Hide System Partitions**:
   - If any system partitions (e.g., Recovery or System_Drv) appear in File Explorer, hide them:
     - Open **Disk Management**.
     - Right-click the partition, select **Change Drive Letter and Paths**, and click **Remove**.

3. **Reconnect Drives**:
   - Once everything is stable, reconnect the new SSD and external drive.
   - Format and assign drive letters to the new SSD partitions as needed.

---

### **Important Notes**
- **UEFI is Recommended**: Keeping UEFI as primary ensures compatibility with modern hardware and software.
- **Legacy Mode Should Be Avoided**: Switching to Legacy can cause boot issues with GPT-partitioned drives.
- **NVMe Drive Must Be Bootable**: Ensure the NVMe drive contains the active Windows installation and is configured correctly for UEFI.

If you’re still having trouble or want to confirm the current state of your system, let me know what’s happening after following these steps!

**USER**: I guess that wasn't the case because I switched it back in order to boot in the first place. I'm building windows back up to see what is set up

**ASSISTANT**: Got it. Rebuilding Windows is a solid step to ensure your system is set up properly, especially since there have been some configuration issues. Here's a concise guide to ensure the rebuild works smoothly and the system is properly configured after installation:

---

### **Step 1: Install Windows on the Correct Drive**
1. **Boot from Installation Media**:
   - Use a USB with the Windows installation tool.
   - Restart your computer and boot into the USB drive (set it as the first boot option in the BIOS if necessary).

2. **Select the NVMe Drive**:
   - During the installation process, ensure you select the NVMe SSD as the target drive for Windows.
   - Format the NVMe drive if necessary to ensure it’s clean and ready.

3. **Partition Style**:
   - If prompted, allow the Windows installer to set up the partitions (UEFI mode will create GPT partitions automatically).

---

### **Step 2: Configure BIOS Boot Settings**
1. **Set UEFI as Primary Boot Mode**:
   - Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings and set **UEFI** as the primary boot mode.
   - Disable Legacy Boot if it’s enabled.

2. **Set Boot Priority**:
   - Ensure the NVMe drive is listed as the first boot device.
   - Save and exit the BIOS.

---

### **Step 3: Complete Windows Setup**
1. Follow the Windows installation steps to set up the system.
2. Once Windows is installed, ensure it boots directly from the NVMe SSD.

---

### **Step 4: Reconfigure Other Drives**
After Windows is fully installed and working properly:

1. **Reconnect the New SSD**:
   - Connect the new SSD and ensure it’s visible in **Disk Management**.
   - Format and partition the new SSD as desired (e.g., assign it as the **D:** drive).

2. **Check for System Partitions**:
   - Ensure no unnecessary system partitions are on the new SSD. If they are, you can safely delete them using Disk Management or a partitioning tool.

3. **Hide Recovery and System Partitions**:
   - For partitions like `System_Drv` or Recovery that may appear in File Explorer, remove their drive letters via **Disk Management**.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Boot Configuration**
1. **Check System Information**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `msinfo32`, and press Enter.
   - Confirm the **Boot Device** points to the NVMe drive.

2. **Clean Up Bootloader Entries**:
   - Open **msconfig** (`Windows + R`, type `msconfig`).
   - Go to the **Boot** tab and remove any duplicate or invalid entries.

---

### **Step 6: Test Stability**
1. Reboot the system multiple times to confirm it consistently boots from the NVMe drive.
2. Check File Explorer to ensure the new SSD is properly formatted and assigned a drive letter.

---

This should resolve any lingering issues with your setup

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, thanks for clarifying! If you're troubleshooting **booting issues** instead of rebuilding Windows, here's how to systematically address the problem to ensure your system boots correctly from the NVMe drive.

---

     bootrec /scanos
     bootrec /rebuildbcd
     ```
   - If prompted, add the NVMe drive to the bootloader.

---

### **Step 3: Remove Other Boot Configurations**
If Windows is trying to boot from the new SSD or any other drive:

1. **Check Boot Entries**:
   - Open Command Prompt via a bootable USB or from within Windows.
   - Type `bcdedit` and press Enter.
   - Look for multiple Windows installations. Identify the one associated with the NVMe drive.

2. **Remove Incorrect Entries**:
   - Use `bcdedit /delete {identifier}` (replace `{identifier}` with the GUID of the unwanted entry).

---

### **Step 4: Disconnect Extra Drives (Optional)**
If the system still isn’t booting correctly:
1. Disconnect the new SSD and any external drives temporarily.
2. Boot with only the NVMe drive connected.
3. Once booting works, reconnect the drives and ensure the NVMe remains the primary boot device.

---

1. **Check Disk Health**:
   - Boot into Windows or use a live USB tool to check the NVMe drive's health with software like **CrystalDiskInfo**.
   
2. **Repair Windows Installation** (if needed):
   - Boot from a Windows installation USB, select **Repair Your Computer**, and choose **Startup Repair**.

---

### **Step 6: Test the System**
1. Reboot multiple times to confirm it consistently boots from the NVMe drive.
2. Verify in **msinfo32** that the NVMe drive is the active boot device.

---

Let me know if you encounter specific issues during these steps!

**USER**: Okay, now did you drive is back to being the way it should, and the c drive is back to being windows. But I still don't see the empty one terabyte of space that should be on the Windows drive

**ASSISTANT**: If you're not seeing the 1TB of space that should be on your Windows drive (the one with Windows on the C: partition), it might be unallocated or not properly formatted. Here’s how to resolve this:

---

### **Step 1: Check Disk Management**
1. **Open Disk Management**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, and press Enter.
   - Review all your connected drives and their partitions.

2. **Locate the Unallocated Space**:
   - Look for your Windows drive in the list (likely marked as **Disk 0** or **Disk 1**).
   - Check if there is unallocated space listed on the drive (it will appear as a black bar).

---

### **Step 2: Use Unallocated Space**
If you find unallocated space, you can either expand your existing C: drive or create a new partition.

#### **Option 1: Expand C: Drive**
1. Right-click the C: partition and choose **Extend Volume**.
2. Follow the wizard to use the unallocated space to expand the C: drive.

#### **Option 2: Create a New Partition**
1. Right-click the unallocated space and select **New Simple Volume**.
2. Follow the wizard to:
   - Assign a drive letter (e.g., **D:**).
   - Format the space as **NTFS**.
3. Once completed, the 1TB space should appear as a new partition in **File Explorer**.

---

### **Step 3: Verify Partition Layout**
If you don’t see the unallocated space, there may be a hidden partition or the space might be assigned incorrectly.

1. **Check for Hidden Partitions**:
   - In Disk Management, see if there’s a large partition without a drive letter.
   - Right-click it, select **Change Drive Letter and Paths**, and assign it a letter.

2. **Use Diskpart to Investigate**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type:
     ```cmd
     diskpart
     list disk
     select disk X (replace X with the disk number for your Windows drive)
     list partition
     ```
   - Look for any large partitions that are not assigned a drive letter.

---

### **Step 4: Check BIOS/UEFI Configuration**
Sometimes BIOS settings can cause confusion about available storage space:
1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI.
2. Check that all installed drives are recognized.
3. Save and exit.

---

### **Step 5: Test with Third-Party Tools**
If the unallocated space or partitions are still missing, use a tool like:
- **MiniTool Partition Wizard**
- **EaseUS Partition Master**
- **AOMEI Partition Assistant**

These tools often provide more visibility and control over partitions and can help recover or reassign missing space.

---

### **Step 6: Verify Drive Formatting**
1. If the drive was recently modified, ensure it is formatted as **GPT** (for UEFI systems) or **MBR** (for Legacy systems).
2. If the drive uses GPT, some space may be reserved for EFI or recovery partitions, which can’t easily be modified.

   list disk
   ```
   - Find the disk number for the new SSD with the unallocated 1TB of space.

4. **Select the Disk**:
   ```cmd
   select disk X
   ```
   Replace **X** with the disk number.

5. **Clean the Disk (Optional)**:
   - If there’s any issue with the partition table, run:
     ```cmd
     clean
     ```
     **Warning**: This removes all data and partitions from the disk.

6. **Create a Partition**:
   ```cmd
   create partition primary
   ```

7. **Format the Partition**:
   ```cmd
   format fs=ntfs quick
   ```

8. **Assign a Drive Letter**:
   ```cmd
   assign letter=D
   ```

9. **Exit Diskpart**:
   ```cmd
   exit
   ```

Check File Explorer to see if the drive is now visible.

---

### **Step 3: Use Third-Party Partitioning Tools**
If Disk Management and Diskpart don’t resolve the issue, try a third-party partition manager. These tools often handle partitioning better than Windows’ built-in utilities:
1. **Download Tools**:
   - **MiniTool Partition Wizard** (Free)
   - **EaseUS Partition Master** (Free)
   - **AOMEI Partition Assistant** (Free)

2. **Steps to Format the Drive**:
   - Open the tool and locate the unallocated 1TB space.
   - Create a new partition on the unallocated space.
   - Format it as NTFS or exFAT and assign a drive letter.

---

### **Step 4: Check for Potential Issues**
If the above steps fail:
1. **Verify the SSD Firmware**:
   - Check the SSD manufacturer’s website for firmware updates.

2. **Check the Drive for Errors**:
   - Use **CHKDSK**:
     ```cmd
     chkdsk X: /f /r
     ```
     Replace **X** with the drive letter.

3. **Test the SSD Health**:
   - Use tools like **CrystalDiskInfo** or the manufacturer’s SSD utility (e.g., Samsung Magician, Crucial Storage Executive) to check for issues.

4. **Try Another Port**:
   - If your SSD is SATA, try a different SATA port or cable.
   - For NVMe SSDs, ensure it's seated properly in the M.2 slot.

---

### **Final Steps**
1. Reboot the computer and reattempt formatting or partitioning after trying the above steps.
2. If the issue persists, the SSD may have a hardware problem. Consider testing it in another system to rule out motherboard compatibility issues.

1. Once Parted Magic is loaded, look for **GParted** in the menu or file explorer.
2. Open it to manage your partitions as needed:
   - Format the unallocated space.
   - Resize or create new partitions.

---

#### **Step 3: Apply Changes and Exit**
1. After making partition changes, apply them in GParted.
2. Reboot your system and remove the USB drive.

### **If Parted Magic Has Issues Booting**
If Parted Magic also struggles to boot, you might face similar hardware compatibility issues as with GParted Live. In that case:
- **Verify BIOS Settings** (e.g., UEFI vs. Legacy, disable Secure Boot).
- **Try Alternative Tools**:
  - **Xubuntu Live** (as you mentioned earlier).
  - **Ventoy** to boot multiple ISOs (including GParted and Parted Magic).

**USER**: My medicat USB is built on ventoy, how do I rebuild the ventoi menu since it's not showing all the isos I've got on my drive

**ASSISTANT**: If your Ventoy-based Medicat USB isn't displaying all the ISOs, the issue may be with the Ventoy menu configuration, corrupted files, or unsupported ISOs. Here's how to rebuild the Ventoy menu and ensure it displays all your ISOs:

---

### **Step 1: Verify Ventoy Version**
1. **Check Your Ventoy Version**:
   - Boot into the Ventoy menu.
   - Look for the version number at the bottom of the screen.

2. **Update Ventoy**:
   - Visit the official Ventoy site: [Ventoy Downloads](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html).
   - Download the latest version.
   - Use the Ventoy update tool to update the bootloader on your USB drive:
     - Run the **Ventoy2Disk.exe** (Windows) or the equivalent script for Linux.
     - Select your USB drive and click **Update** (this won't erase the data on your drive).

---

### **Step 2: Refresh the Ventoy Menu**
1. **Ensure Correct Directory for ISOs**:
   - Ventoy automatically scans for ISOs in the root directory or subdirectories of your USB drive.
   - Place all your ISO files directly in the root folder or organize them into folders (e.g., `ISOs` or `Bootable`).

2. **Regenerate the Menu**:
   - After organizing your ISOs, reboot into Ventoy.
   - Ventoy will scan for and rebuild the menu dynamically.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Unsupported ISOs**
1. **Verify ISO Compatibility**:
   - Some ISOs may not be natively supported by Ventoy. Check the compatibility list: [Ventoy Compatibility](https://www.ventoy.net/en/isolist.html).
   - Unsupported ISOs can sometimes work by enabling **ISO Boot Plugins** (Step 4).

2. **Rename ISOs if Necessary**:
   - Avoid special characters, spaces, or excessively long filenames.
   - Rename files to simpler names like `ubuntu.iso` or `medicat.iso`.

---

### **Step 4: Enable Ventoy Plugins for Advanced ISOs**
If certain ISOs still don’t appear, configure Ventoy plugins:

1. **Create a `ventoy.json` File**:
   - Inside the root of your USB drive, create a file named `ventoy.json`.

2. **Example `ventoy.json`**:
   ```json
   {
       "control": [
           { "VTOY_DEFAULT_MENU_MODE": "1" },
           { "VTOY_TREE_VIEW_MENU_STYLE": "1" }
       ]
   }
   ```
   - This enables a tree-view menu and forces certain ISOs to display.

3. **Place Plugins in a Folder**:
   - Put the `ventoy.json` file in a folder named `ventoy`.

4. **Reboot Ventoy**:
   - Boot into Ventoy and check if the missing ISOs appear.

---

### **Step 5: Test for Corruption**
1. **Verify ISOs**:
   - Ensure the ISOs are not corrupted by testing them on another system or using a checksum verification tool (e.g., `SHA256`).

2. **Reformat USB (if necessary)**:
   - Back up your ISOs and reformat the USB drive using the Ventoy tool.
   - Reinstall Ventoy and copy your ISOs back to the USB.

---

### **Step 6: Debugging in Ventoy**
1. **Enable Debug Mode**:
   - Press `Ctrl + I` in the Ventoy boot menu to enter interactive mode and debug ISO loading issues.
2. **Log Errors**:
   - Look for errors related to the missing ISOs in the debug output.

---

### **Final Check**
After completing these steps:
- Boot into Ventoy and ensure all ISOs are displayed.
- If an ISO still doesn't show, test it on another Ventoy USB to rule out hardware or file-specific issues.
