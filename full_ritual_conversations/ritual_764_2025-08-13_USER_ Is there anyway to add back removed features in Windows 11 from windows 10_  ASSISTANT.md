**USER**: Is there anyway to add back removed features in Windows 11 from windows 10?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, there are ways to bring back some of the features that were present in Windows 10 but removed or changed in Windows 11. Below are a few options:

### 1. **Third-Party Tools**
   - Many third-party tools and utilities allow you to re-enable or mimic the functionality that was available in Windows 10:
     - **StartAllBack or Start11**: These tools can restore the classic Start menu and taskbar from Windows 10. They offer customization options to bring back the look and feel you're used to.
     - **ExplorerPatcher**: A free and open-source tool that provides a way to restore the classic taskbar and other interface elements, such as the system tray layout and context menus.
     - **Winaero Tweaker**: This customization tool lets you tweak a variety of hidden Windows settings, bringing back some older features and improving usability.

### 2. **Registry Edits and Group Policy Tweaks**
   - Some of the changes in Windows 11 can be reversed by modifying the Windows Registry or Group Policy. For example:
     - **Classic Right-Click Context Menu**: If you prefer the Windows 10 style context menu, you can adjust a registry setting to disable the new menu in Windows 11:
       - Open `regedit` and navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID`.
       - Create a new key named `{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}`.
       - Under this key, create a new key named `InprocServer32`.
       - Double-click on the default entry in `InprocServer32` and set its value to blank.
       - Restart Windows Explorer to see the changes.
     - **Taskbar Tweaks**: If you want to adjust the size of the taskbar or move it to a different position, you can use the Registry or Group Policy settings to accomplish this, although not all options are fully restored.

### 3. **PowerShell Commands**
   - PowerShell can be used to modify settings or remove some of the new features that you may not like in Windows 11. For instance, to bring back the old Windows Photo Viewer as the default viewer, you can use PowerShell scripts to associate the file types back to it.

### 4. **Using Classic Apps**
   - **Snipping Tool, Control Panel, and Other Classic Apps**: If you prefer using the classic versions of certain applications, you can often find ways to restore or access these legacy applications by installing older versions or finding workarounds. The classic Control Panel is still available through certain shortcuts, for example, by typing `Control` in the Run dialog (`Win + R`).

### 5. **Custom File Explorer Layouts**
   - If you dislike the new File Explorer layout in Windows 11, you can use tweaks or third-party tools to bring back the classic ribbon interface, similar to how it was in Windows 10. Tools like **OldNewExplorer** can help modify the appearance and behavior of File Explorer.

### 6. **Revert to Windows 10 UI Elements**
   - In some cases, older UI elements can be enabled by using third-party tools or by modifying system files, though this can be more involved and might impact system stability. If you're adventurous, you can try tools like **UltraUXThemePatcher** or custom shell skins to apply themes that mimic the Windows 10 look.

Do note that some changes may be more difficult to reverse or may not be possible without more extensive modifications to the system. Also, before making any registry or system changes, it's a good practice to create a system backup or restore point to prevent any unintended issues.
