**USER**: Build me a powershell to graphically show why today I have much less space on my HDD compared to yesterday.

**USER**: Well, I mean I don't have a backup of anything, we're generating this on the fly, so it has to be from today, back to yesterday, with nothing to go on but files.

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Justin—here’s a **PowerShell script** that visually compares your disk usage between today and yesterday. This script will:

- Take a snapshot of your current drive usage (per folder, at the root of C: or any specified path).
- Retrieve a snapshot from a previous date (or let you point to an exported CSV from yesterday).
- Generate a simple bar graph showing which folders grew or shrank in size.
- **Requirements:**  
  - PowerShell 5.1+ (native on Win10/11).
  - Windows Forms or WPF (for graphical output), or optionally **Out-GridView** for interactive grids.
  - Optionally, [PSWriteHTML](https://evotec.xyz/powershell-pswritehtml/) or [ImportExcel](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel) module for HTML/Excel charting if you want pretty charts.

**Here’s a script for a graphical, no-modules-required comparison using Windows Forms** (just run as-is in PowerShell):

---

### Step 1: Save a Baseline (run at the end of each day)

```powershell
# Save a snapshot of folder sizes at the root of C:\
$yesterday = Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd'
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Directory | 
    ForEach-Object {
        $size = (Get-ChildItem -Path $_.FullName -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum
        [PSCustomObject]@{Folder = $_.FullName; SizeGB = [math]::Round($size / 1GB, 2) }
    } | Export-Csv -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\HDDUsage_$yesterday.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
> **Do this once each day, or as a scheduled task.**

---

### Step 2: Compare and Visualize (run this anytime)

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms

function Show-BarChart ($data) {
    [void][Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.Windows.Forms")
    [void][Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.Drawing")

    $form = New-Object Windows.Forms.Form
    $form.Text = "HDD Usage Change by Folder"
    $form.Width = 900
    $form.Height = 600

    $bmp = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $form.Width, $form.Height
    $g = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bmp)
    $font = New-Object Drawing.Font "Arial",10
    $brush = [Drawing.Brushes]::Black

    $margin = 60
    $maxDiff = [Math]::Max([Math]::Abs(($data.ChangeGB | Measure-Object -Maximum).Maximum), [Math]::Abs(($data.ChangeGB | Measure-Object -Minimum).Minimum))
    $scale = ($form.Height - 2*$margin) / ($maxDiff * 2 + 1)

    for ($i = 0; $i -lt $data.Count; $i++) {
        $folder = $data[$i].Folder
        $diff = $data[$i].ChangeGB
        $x = $margin + $i * 70
        $y0 = $form.Height/2
        $y1 = $y0 - ($diff * $scale)
        $color = if ($diff -gt 0) { [Drawing.Brushes]::Red } elseif ($diff -lt 0) { [Drawing.Brushes]::Green } else { [Drawing.Brushes]::Gray }
        $g.FillRectangle($color, $x, [Math]::Min($y0,$y1), 40, [Math]::Abs($y1-$y0))
        $g.DrawString(("{0:N2} GB" -f $diff), $font, $brush, $x, $y1-20)
        $g.DrawString(($folder -replace '^.*\\([^\\]+)$','$1'), $font, $brush, $x, $form.Height-40)
    }

    $picBox = New-Object Windows.Forms.PictureBox
    $picBox.Image = $bmp
    $picBox.Dock = "Fill"
    $form.Controls.Add($picBox)

    $form.ShowDialog()
}

# Choose two CSV files (yesterday and today)
[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.windows.forms") | Out-Null
$yesterdayFile = [System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog]::new()
$yesterdayFile.Title = "Select Yesterday's CSV"
$yesterdayFile.Filter = "CSV Files|*.csv"
$null = $yesterdayFile.ShowDialog()
$csv1 = Import-Csv $yesterdayFile.FileName

$today = Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd'
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\" -Directory | 
    ForEach-Object {
        $size = (Get-ChildItem -Path $_.FullName -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum
        [PSCustomObject]@{Folder = $_.FullName; SizeGB = [math]::Round($size / 1GB, 2) }
    } | Export-Csv -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\HDDUsage_$today.csv" -NoTypeInformation

$csv2 = Import-Csv "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\HDDUsage_$today.csv"

# Join and compute difference
$diff = foreach ($row in $csv2) {
    $yest = $csv1 | Where-Object { $_.Folder -eq $row.Folder }
    if ($yest) {
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Folder = $row.Folder
            TodayGB = [double]$row.SizeGB
            YesterdayGB = [double]$yest.SizeGB
            ChangeGB = [math]::Round([double]$row.SizeGB - [double]$yest.SizeGB,2)
        }
    }
}

# Only show where there’s a change
$chartData = $diff | Where-Object { $_.ChangeGB -ne 0 } | Sort-Object ChangeGB -Descending

Show-BarChart $chartData
```

### 🟩 **How it Works**
- **Step 1:** Run the *snapshot* script at the end of each day (or before a big install/uninstall).  
- **Step 2:** Run the *comparison* script. It will:
    - Prompt you for yesterday’s CSV,
    - Take a new snapshot,
    - Generate a simple per-folder bar chart of changes (red = gained space, green = lost space).

---

#### 🔹 **Options:**
- Want **pie charts or Excel/HTML output**? Ask, and I’ll adapt for PSWriteHTML/ImportExcel!
- Want to target a different drive or deeper subfolders? Just change `"C:\"` in both scripts.

---

Let me know if you want this as a downloadable `.ps1`, or need a **one-click GUI** for ongoing comparisons (or advanced reporting by filetype, user, etc.).  
**This is 100% local—no cloud/telemetry.** Enjoy!

**ASSISTANT**: Great clarification!  
You want to **analyze your HDD right now** and, *without any pre-existing snapshots or logs*, **find out what changed since yesterday**—what’s taking up new space, and where.

**Windows does not natively track folder size history,** so here’s what you can do, *using only the files and metadata currently on your system*:

---

## 🟩 Powershell Solution: “What Grew Since Yesterday?” (No Prior Log Needed)

We’ll:
- Find all files modified **in the last 24 hours** (or since midnight yesterday).
- Group them by folder.
- Calculate how much **new/changed data** appeared in each folder.
- Show the top “growth” culprits graphically.

**This gives you a “reverse diff”—where did new/changed data accumulate since yesterday?**

---

### 🟦 PowerShell Script (With Graphical Output)

Paste this into PowerShell (it runs on Win10/11):

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing

# === 1. Set Parameters ===
$root = "C:\"   # or whatever drive/folder you want to analyze
$since = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)

# === 2. Gather Modified Files ===
Write-Host "Scanning files modified since $since ... (may take a while)"
$recentFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $root -Recurse -File -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
    Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -gt $since }

# === 3. Group by Top-Level Folder ===
$data = $recentFiles | Group-Object {
    $folder = $_.Directory.FullName
    # Just top-level folder under $root:
    if ($folder -like "$root*") {
        ($folder -replace [regex]::Escape($root), '').Split('\')[0]
    } else { $folder }
} | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Folder = if ($_.Name -eq "") { $root } else { Join-Path $root $_.Name }
        ChangedMB = [math]::Round(($_.Group | Measure-Object Length -Sum).Sum / 1MB, 2)
        FileCount = $_.Group.Count
    }
}

# === 4. Filter/Sort Results ===
$data = $data | Where-Object { $_.ChangedMB -gt 0 } | Sort-Object ChangedMB -Descending

if (-not $data) {
    [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("No folders changed significantly in the last 24 hours.","HDD Usage Diff")
    return
}

# === 5. Draw Bar Chart ===
$form = New-Object Windows.Forms.Form
$form.Text = "Folders Gaining Space Since Yesterday"
$form.Width = 900
$form.Height = 600

$bmp = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $form.Width, $form.Height
$g = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bmp)
$font = New-Object Drawing.Font "Arial",10
$brush = [Drawing.Brushes]::Black

$margin = 80
$barWidth = 40
$gap = 20
$max = ($data.ChangedMB | Measure-Object -Maximum).Maximum
if ($max -eq 0) { $max = 1 }
$heightScale = ($form.Height - 2 * $margin) / $max

for ($i = 0; $i -lt $data.Count; $i++) {
    $folder = $data[$i].Folder
    $val = $data[$i].ChangedMB
    $count = $data[$i].FileCount
    $x = $margin + $i * ($barWidth + $gap)
    $y = $form.Height - $margin - ($val * $heightScale)
    $color = [Drawing.Brushes]::Red
    $g.FillRectangle($color, $x, $y, $barWidth, $val * $heightScale)
    $g.DrawString("$($val) MB", $font, $brush, $x, $y-20)
    $g.DrawString("$($folder -replace '^.*\\([^\\]+)$','$1')", $font, $brush, $x-10, $form.Height-50)
    $g.DrawString("$count files", $font, $brush, $x-10, $form.Height-35)
}

$picBox = New-Object Windows.Forms.PictureBox
$picBox.Image = $bmp
$picBox.Dock = "Fill"
$form.Controls.Add($picBox)
$form.ShowDialog()
```

## 🟪 **What does this do?**
- **Scans all files** under the chosen drive/folder.
- **Finds everything changed in the last 24 hours.**
- **Groups and sums by top-level folder** (e.g., `C:\Users`, `C:\ProgramData`, `C:\Windows`…).
- **Displays a bar chart** showing which folders gained the most data, with MB changed and file count.

---

## 🟨 **You can:**
- Change `$root` to another drive/folder (e.g., `"D:\"`).
- Adjust `$since` to scan further back if needed (e.g., `.AddDays(-2)` for 48 hours).

---

**Let me know if you want:**
- File-level breakdowns (not just folders).
- Pie charts or Excel exports.
- A top-100 file list instead of folder chart.
- Any other custom tweak.

You can run this script instantly—no backup or log needed!  
**If you want a one-liner that just shows the top folders in plain text (no chart), just ask.**
