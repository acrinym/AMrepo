**USER**: How do I obtain computer serial with WMI cmd

**ASSISTANT**: You can obtain the serial number of a computer using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) via the Command Prompt. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2. **Run the WMI Command:**
   Enter the following command:

   ```cmd
   wmic bios get serialnumber
   ```

   This will return the serial number of the computer.

### Explanation:
- **`wmic`**: This is the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line tool.
- **`bios get serialnumber`**: Fetches the serial number from the system's BIOS.

### Example Output:
```cmd
SerialNumber
1234-ABCD-5678
```

If the serial number appears as `To Be Filled By OEM` or is blank, it means the manufacturer didn't program a serial number into the BIOS.

**USER**: Is there a javascript command/ script that I can run or you can make to export a bmc remedy helix ticket to txt or html?

**ASSISTANT**: Creating a JavaScript script to export a BMC Remedy Helix ticket as a `.txt` or `.html` file requires access to the platform's APIs. BMC Remedy Helix provides REST APIs for interacting with the system, including fetching ticket details. Here's a general approach:

### Prerequisites
1. **API Access**: Ensure you have API credentials (username, password, or token) and endpoint details from your BMC Helix Remedy administrator.
2. **API Documentation**: Refer to the BMC Helix REST API documentation for endpoint details and supported data formats.

### Example JavaScript Script
Below is a script that fetches ticket details using the BMC Helix REST API and saves them as a `.txt` or `.html` file:

```javascript
// Include a library like Axios for easier HTTP requests
const axios = require('axios');
const fs = require('fs');

// Configuration
const apiUrl = 'https://your-bmc-remedy-helix-instance/api/arsys/v1/entry/';
const username = 'your-username';
const password = 'your-password';
const ticketId = 'TICKET-ID'; // Replace with the actual ticket ID

// Function to fetch ticket details
async function fetchTicketDetails() {
    try {
        // Authenticate and fetch ticket data
        const response = await axios.get(`${apiUrl}/Ticket/${ticketId}`, {
            auth: {
                username: username,
                password: password,
            },
        });

        // Ticket details
        const ticket = response.data;

        // Format ticket details
        const textData = `Ticket ID: ${ticketId}
Summary: ${ticket.values.Summary}
Description: ${ticket.values.Description}
Status: ${ticket.values.Status}
Created Date: ${ticket.values.CreatedDate}`;

        const htmlData = `
        <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Ticket Details</h1>
            <p><b>Ticket ID:</b> ${ticketId}</p>
            <p><b>Summary:</b> ${ticket.values.Summary}</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> ${ticket.values.Description}</p>
            <p><b>Status:</b> ${ticket.values.Status}</p>
            <p><b>Created Date:</b> ${ticket.values.CreatedDate}</p>
        </body>
        </html>`;

        // Save as .txt
        fs.writeFileSync(`${ticketId}.txt`, textData);
        console.log('Ticket exported to TXT.');

        // Save as .html
        fs.writeFileSync(`${ticketId}.html`, htmlData);
        console.log('Ticket exported to HTML.');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching ticket details:', error.message);
    }
}

// Run the function
fetchTicketDetails();
```

### How It Works
1. **API Call**: The script sends a GET request to the BMC Remedy Helix REST API to retrieve ticket details.
2. **Formatting**: The response data is formatted as plain text (`.txt`) and HTML (`.html`).
3. **File Export**: The formatted data is saved to files using Node.js' `fs` module.

### Notes
- Replace placeholders (`apiUrl`, `username`, `password`, `ticketId`) with actual values from your environment.
- If running in a browser, you can adapt this script using `fetch` instead of `axios` and handle file download via Blob and `URL.createObjectURL`.
- Ensure API credentials are stored securely.
- Test API endpoints and responses using tools like Postman to confirm the required parameters.
