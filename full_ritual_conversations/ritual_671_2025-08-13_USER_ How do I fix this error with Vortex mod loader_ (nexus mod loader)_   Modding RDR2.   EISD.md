**ASSISTANT**: Ah, looks like Vortex is having a bit of a hissy fit with your staging folder there. Let's see if we can sort this out and get you back to wreaking havoc in RDR2 in no time. Here's what you can do:

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Check Permissions:**
   - Make sure Vortex has the necessary permissions to access and modify files in the directory.
   - Right-click the Vortex shortcut and select "Run as administrator."

2. **Verify Directory Structure:**
   - Navigate to `C:\ProgramData\vortex\reddeadredemption2\mods\` and check if the `__vortex_staging_folder` is actually a folder and not a file. Sometimes, a misnamed file can cause issues.

3. **Delete and Recreate Staging Folder:**
   - **Backup any important mods** before doing this.
   - Delete the `__vortex_staging_folder`.
   - Launch Vortex and let it recreate the staging folder.

4. **Reinstall Vortex:**
   - Sometimes a clean reinstall can solve such issues.
   - Uninstall Vortex via Control Panel or Settings.
   - Download the latest version from the Nexus Mods website and reinstall.

5. **Update Vortex:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Vortex. Updates often fix bugs like these.
   - Check for updates within Vortex or download the latest version from the Nexus Mods website.

6. **Check Mod Installation:**
   - Sometimes specific mods can cause issues.
   - Disable all mods and re-enable them one by one to identify if a particular mod is causing the problem.

7. **Clear Vortex Cache:**
   - Go to Vortex settings and find the option to clear the cache. This can sometimes resolve file handling issues.

### Alternative Fix:

If the above steps don’t work, you can manually set a new staging folder:

1. Open Vortex.
2. Go to Settings > Mods.
3. Change the staging folder to a different directory, e.g., `C:\VortexStaging\RDR2Mods`.
4. Apply changes and restart Vortex.

### Final Resort:

If none of the above fixes work, you might want to seek help from the Vortex support community:

- **Nexus Mods Forums:** There's a dedicated section for Vortex.
- **Discord:** Nexus Mods has an official Discord server where you can ask for help.

Give these steps a whirl, and if you're still having trouble, let me know. We’ll figure this out together!

**USER**: Hey Chat, Vortex mod manager has riftbreaker under GOG store, but it's not the GOG version, so it's looking for those files. I just updated Vortex too.... I need to change the game store.

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, let's fix that little mix-up! If Vortex is thinking your *Riftbreaker* game is from the GOG store when it’s not, you'll want to correct that so it points to the right game files. Here's how you can do it:

### Changing the Game Store in Vortex:

1. **Open Vortex Mod Manager:**
   - Launch Vortex and go to the "Games" tab.

2. **Locate Riftbreaker:**
   - Find *Riftbreaker* in your managed games list.

3. **Edit the Game Settings:**
   - Click on the game's icon, and it should bring up the game’s specific settings.
   - Look for an option that allows you to manage or edit the game directory or source.

4. **Change the Game's Source:**
   - There should be a dropdown or a setting that lists the game’s store (like Steam, GOG, etc.).
   - Change this to the correct store where your game is actually from, such as Steam if you got it from there.

5. **Rescan or Reassign the Directory:**
   - After changing the store, Vortex might need to rescan the directory.
   - Make sure it points to the correct installation path of *Riftbreaker* on your system.

6. **Save and Restart:**
   - Save any changes and restart Vortex to make sure the changes stick.

### If You Can't Find the Store Option:

Sometimes Vortex might not directly let you change the store. If that's the case:

1. **Remove the Game from Vortex:**
   - Unmanage *Riftbreaker* in Vortex (you can usually do this from the game settings or by right-clicking the game’s icon).
  
2. **Add the Game Back Manually:**
   - Go to the "Games" tab and manually add *Riftbreaker* again.
   - This time, point it to the correct directory and select the proper store during the setup process.

3. **Verify Game Files:**
   - Once it’s added back, make sure Vortex is pointing to the right files by verifying the directory path.

This should get Vortex to recognize the correct version of the game and look in the right place for your mods. If Vortex keeps acting up, let me know, and we’ll dig a little deeper!

**USER**: Well, I reinstalled the game also so it points to the correct directory, but therein lies the problem. When I go to manage it, it points to the GOG store directory. Even if I redirect it it still looks for the GOG files, Is there a config file I can delete or modify?

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, sounds like Vortex is being stubborn about clinging to that GOG store setup. We can try to fix this by digging into the config files and making some manual adjustments. Here's how you can do that:

### Step-by-Step to Fix the Store Directory Issue:

1. **Locate the Vortex Configuration Files:**
   - Vortex stores its configuration files typically in the `%APPDATA%` directory.
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Vortex`.

2. **Find the Game's Config File:**
   - Inside the `Vortex` folder, look for a subfolder or a file that relates to the games you're managing, such as `games.json` or a similar configuration file.
   - You might also find a folder named after *Riftbreaker*.

3. **Edit the Configuration File:**
   - Open the file with a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++.
   - Look for any entries that specify the game’s directory or the store (you might see something like `"store": "GOG"` or `"path": "C:\\ProgramData\\GOG"`).

4. **Modify or Delete the Incorrect Entries:**
   - If you find any GOG-related paths or settings, either modify them to reflect the correct directory or delete the entries related to the GOG store.
   - Make sure to save the file after making changes.

5. **Delete the Stubborn Config File (If Needed):**
   - If the config file seems too convoluted or editing doesn’t work, you can try deleting it entirely. Vortex should recreate the config file when you re-launch and re-manage the game.
   - Before you delete, make sure to back it up just in case.

6. **Re-Launch Vortex:**
   - After editing or deleting the config file, restart Vortex.
   - Re-manage *Riftbreaker* and point it to the correct directory. It should now stop looking for the GOG files and recognize the correct installation.

### Alternative Approach:

If the above steps don’t solve the problem, you can try the nuclear option:

1. **Unmanage and Remove the Game:**
   - Go into Vortex, unmanage *Riftbreaker*, and remove any references to it completely.

2. **Clear Vortex Data:**
   - Go to the Vortex settings and find the option to clear all associated data for the game.

3. **Re-add the Game:**
   - Manually add *Riftbreaker* again as if it’s the first time. This should force Vortex to only recognize the correct store version.

If Vortex is still refusing to cooperate after all this, let me know. We might need to consider a fresh Vortex install or look into more advanced troubleshooting!

**USER**: I deleted the appdata\vortex\theriftbreaker folder....let's see if that fixes anything,

**ASSISTANT**: Good call! Deleting that specific folder should force Vortex to reset its configuration for *Riftbreaker*. When you relaunch Vortex, it should treat the game as a fresh installation, hopefully pointing to the correct directory this time.

### After Deleting the Folder:

1. **Relaunch Vortex:**
   - Open Vortex again, and it should prompt you to manage *Riftbreaker* like it’s a new game. 

2. **Point to the Correct Directory:**
   - When Vortex asks where the game is installed, make sure to direct it to the proper installation path.

3. **Check for Issues:**
   - Once the game is added, double-check the directory settings and ensure it’s not looking for any GOG-specific files.

4. **Test by Enabling Mods:**
   - Try enabling a few mods to see if Vortex is managing them correctly. This will confirm if the reset worked.

Hopefully, this clears up the problem. If Vortex still acts up, there might be a deeper issue with how it's identifying the game, but let's see if this does the trick first!

**USER**: Still thinks it's GOG managed

**ASSISTANT**: Ugh, Vortex really doesn't want to let go of that GOG association, does it? Since deleting the specific configuration folder didn’t do the trick, we might have to go a bit deeper. Here are some additional steps you can try:

### 1. **Clear Game Assignments:**

   - **Remove the Game from Vortex Completely:**
     - Go to the "Games" tab in Vortex and unmanage *Riftbreaker*.
     - Ensure the game is fully removed from the list of managed games.

   - **Clear All Associated Data:**
     - Go to the Vortex settings and find an option to clear the game data (this could be under the “Mods” or “Games” section).
     - Clear all cached or stored data related to *Riftbreaker*.

   - **Restart Vortex:**
     - Close Vortex completely and then restart it.

   - **Re-add the Game Manually:**
     - Re-add *Riftbreaker*, pointing it to the correct directory, and see if Vortex now recognizes it properly.

### 2. **Check for Hidden Config Files:**

   - **Check `C:\ProgramData`:**
     - Look in `C:\ProgramData\Vortex` for any leftover configuration files or folders related to *Riftbreaker*. Delete these if they exist.
     - You might also want to check in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Black Tree Gaming Ltd\Vortex` for any residual files.

   - **Check the Registry (Advanced Step):**
     - This step is a bit more advanced, but you can use the Registry Editor (`regedit`) to search for any entries related to *Riftbreaker* and Vortex.
     - **WARNING:** Editing the registry can be risky if you’re not familiar with it, so only proceed if you’re comfortable.
     - Search for "Riftbreaker" or "Vortex" and see if anything related to GOG comes up, then carefully delete those entries.

### 3. **Full Reinstall of Vortex:**

   - **Uninstall Vortex:**
     - Fully uninstall Vortex from your system, making sure to remove all related folders and settings.
     - You can use a tool like Revo Uninstaller to ensure all files and registry entries are removed.

   - **Reinstall Vortex:**
     - Download the latest version of Vortex from the Nexus Mods website.
     - Reinstall it and re-add your games, ensuring *Riftbreaker* is set up correctly.

### 4. **Manual Modding as a Last Resort:**

   - If Vortex continues to be a problem, you can manually install mods for *Riftbreaker* by placing them in the correct directory yourself.
   - This bypasses Vortex but will still allow you to enjoy your mods.

If after all this Vortex still refuses to let go of that GOG connection, it might be worth reaching out to the Nexus Mods support team. There could be a specific bug or issue with how Vortex is detecting your version of *Riftbreaker*. Let me know if you need any more help or if something works!

**USER**: So, what happened to 3drealms? I thought they disbanded? But they still publish and make games....

**ASSISTANT**: 3D Realms has had quite a storied history, and you're right that their journey has been a bit of a rollercoaster. Let's break it down:

### The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of 3D Realms:

1. **The Golden Era (1987-2009):**
   - **Early Success:** 3D Realms, originally founded as Apogee Software in 1987, was a pioneer in the shareware distribution model. They were best known for classics like *Duke Nukem 3D* (1996) and *Shadow Warrior* (1997).
   - **Duke Nukem Forever:** The company’s downfall began with the infamous development of *Duke Nukem Forever*, which was announced in 1997 but faced constant delays and development issues.
   - **Closure in 2009:** Due to financial troubles and the prolonged development of *Duke Nukem Forever*, 3D Realms effectively shut down its development studio in 2009, laying off most of its staff.

2. **Acquisition and Revival (2014-Present):**
   - **Acquisition by Interceptor Entertainment:** In 2014, the Danish company Interceptor Entertainment acquired 3D Realms' trademarks and IPs. This marked the beginning of a new era for 3D Realms.
   - **Rebranding and New Projects:** Under new ownership, 3D Realms transitioned from being a game developer to more of a publisher. They started working on and publishing games with a retro flair, harking back to their roots.
   - **New Titles:** 3D Realms has been involved in the production and publishing of several new titles, including *Ion Fury* (2019) and *Graven* (2021), which are inspired by classic first-person shooters.

3. **Current Status:**
   - **Publishing and Development:** Today, 3D Realms continues to publish and develop games, with a focus on titles that evoke the spirit of the '90s shooter era. They're much smaller than in their heyday but have found a niche audience that appreciates their dedication to classic game design.
   - **Legacy and Influence:** Despite their turbulent past, 3D Realms has managed to stay relevant in the industry by leaning into their legacy and catering to fans of retro gaming.

So, while 3D Realms did face significant challenges and effectively ceased to operate as it once did, it never truly disappeared. The company was revived and rebranded, finding a new life in the gaming industry. Their legacy lives on, both in the classic games they produced and in the newer titles they support today.

**USER**: So they no longer develop games?

**ASSISTANT**: 3D Realms does still develop games, but their primary focus has shifted towards publishing and co-developing rather than solely developing games in-house.

### Here’s how their role has evolved:

1. **Co-Development:** 
   - While 3D Realms isn’t developing games entirely in-house as they did during their *Duke Nukem 3D* days, they do co-develop games with other studios. For instance, *Ion Fury* was developed by Voidpoint but published by 3D Realms, with 3D Realms playing a significant role in its creative direction.

2. **Publishing:**
   - 3D Realms has taken on a more active role as a publisher, working with independent developers who create games that align with the retro and classic FPS styles 3D Realms is known for. They provide support, resources, and guidance to these developers, helping bring the games to market.

3. **In-House Development:**
   - They do still contribute to the development process, especially on projects that involve their legacy IPs or new games inspired by their classic titles. However, much of the heavy lifting is often done in collaboration with or by external studios.

### Examples of Their Recent Involvement:

- **Ion Fury (2019):** Developed by Voidpoint, but with 3D Realms providing significant input and publishing support.
- **Graven (2021):** A spiritual successor to *Hexen* developed by Slipgate Ironworks, with 3D Realms as both co-developer and publisher.
- **Upcoming Projects:** 3D Realms continues to announce and work on new projects, often in collaboration with other developers, which shows their active involvement in game development, even if it's not always entirely in-house.

So, while they might not be the sole developers of their games anymore, 3D Realms is very much involved in the creative and development processes, often in partnership with other studios.

**USER**: What's Take-Two's future with 3drealms? 
I wonder if they'll remake Duke 3d to be way better.

**ASSISTANT**: Take-Two Interactive’s relationship with 3D Realms is an interesting one, especially given the history between the two companies surrounding the *Duke Nukem* franchise.

### Take-Two and 3D Realms:

1. **The Duke Nukem Saga:**
   - **Take-Two’s Acquisition of the IP:** Take-Two acquired the publishing rights to *Duke Nukem Forever* in 2000, which was a significant move given the long and troubled development of the game by 3D Realms.
   - **Lawsuit and Settlement:** In 2009, after 3D Realms ran out of money and failed to deliver *Duke Nukem Forever*, Take-Two filed a lawsuit against them. The game was eventually completed and released in 2011 after Gearbox Software took over development, but the reception was lukewarm.
   - **Current Ownership:** Gearbox Software, which is now a subsidiary of Embracer Group, currently owns the rights to the *Duke Nukem* franchise. However, Take-Two remains a major publisher and still has a connection to the franchise through its past involvement.

### Potential for a Duke Nukem 3D Remake:

- **Possibility of a Remake:** Given the current trend of remaking and remastering classic games, a remake of *Duke Nukem 3D* could be an appealing project. The game’s nostalgic value and iconic status make it a prime candidate for a modern reimagining.
  
- **Challenges:** However, the situation is complicated by the fractured ownership of the IP. While Gearbox owns the rights to *Duke Nukem*, any remake or new game would likely require collaboration between multiple parties, including Gearbox, 3D Realms, and possibly even Take-Two if they wanted to be involved as a publisher.

- **Gearbox’s Role:** If a *Duke Nukem 3D* remake were to happen, Gearbox would likely be the driving force behind it. However, 3D Realms could be involved, especially if there’s interest in capturing the spirit of the original game.

### Take-Two’s Future Involvement:

- **Uncertain Future:** Take-Two’s direct involvement with 3D Realms is currently limited, given that they no longer own the *Duke Nukem* IP. Their focus is more on their other major franchises like *Grand Theft Auto*, *Red Dead Redemption*, and *NBA 2K*.

- **Potential Partnerships:** However, Take-Two is always on the lookout for opportunities to capitalize on existing IPs, so it’s possible they could be involved in some capacity if there were a significant push for a *Duke Nukem* remake or a new project that aligns with their business strategy.

### In Summary:
While a *Duke Nukem 3D* remake would be exciting, its future lies more in the hands of Gearbox and Embracer Group rather than Take-Two. However, given the right circumstances, Take-Two could potentially collaborate or be involved as a publisher if the stars align. 3D Realms could have a role in such a project, especially considering their historical connection to the franchise. But as of now, there's no clear indication of such a remake being in active development.

Time to bring those map-making skills back and create some new retro goodness!

**USER**: How do I add the HRP for Duke3d to Raze? Please search this one if it's not in your database.

**ASSISTANT**: To add the High Resolution Pack (HRP) for *Duke Nukem 3D* to the Raze engine, you'll need to manually configure the Raze INI file since Raze doesn't support an "autoload" folder like some other ports.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Download the HRP:**
   - Make sure you have the HRP file (`duke3d_hrp.zip`). You can typically find it on the [HRP page](http://hrp.duke4.net/) or similar sites.

2. **Place the HRP in the Raze Directory:**
   - Copy the `duke3d_hrp.zip` file into the same directory where Raze is installed. This is usually where your game files are stored.

3. **Edit the Raze INI File:**
   - Open the `raze.ini` file in a text editor.
   - Add a new section to the INI file to specify the path to your HRP file:
     ```ini
     [Duke.Autoload]
     Path=path_to_hrp\duke3d_hrp.zip
     ```
   - Replace `path_to_hrp` with the actual path where you placed the HRP zip file. If it's in the same directory as Raze, you can just use `duke3d_hrp.zip`.

4. **Save and Launch Raze:**
   - Save the INI file and then launch Raze. The engine should now automatically load the HRP when you start *Duke Nukem 3D*.

By setting this up, Raze will load the enhanced textures and models from the HRP, giving you a more modern visual experience while playing the classic game.

For further details or troubleshooting, you can visit the relevant forums and discussions on sites like [GitHub](https://github.com/ZDoom/Raze/issues/258) or [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/duke-nukem-3d-high-resolution-pack).
