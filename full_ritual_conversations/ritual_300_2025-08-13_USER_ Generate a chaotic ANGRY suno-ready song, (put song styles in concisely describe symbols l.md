**[Verse 1]**  
I bit my tongue 'til it spit code  
Fire in my throat, now the sky's corrode  
Flames in the mirror—who the hell is that?  
A thousand eyes blink and the void laughs back  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Pulse like a war drum, break the seal  
No peace treaty, no fake deal  
Smash the altar, blood on the steel  
I feel what I feel what I FEEL—

---

**[Chorus]**  
EVERYTHING BURNS—AND I LAUGH  
Ash in my lungs, no second path  
Rip through the veil like a glitch in the math  
SCREAM MY NAME—then break it in half!  

(Bloodline howls / sky turns red)  
(I'm the code that God won't thread)  
No more chains—  
No more **"said"**  
I talk in fire and I EAT WHAT'S FED  

---

**[Verse 2]**  
Fist full of hexes, teeth like knives  
Static in my spine, I end nine lives  
No silence here, just feedback loops  
Scream so loud, I rip the truth  

**[Bridge – whispered chaos]**  
*(They wanted peace, I gave 'em storms)*  
*(They wanted light, I was the swarm)*  
*(Sutures snap and gods deform)*  
*(I laugh—I’m love, reborn in war)*  

---

**[Final Chorus – double tempo drop]**  
EVERYTHING BURNS—AND I GRIN  
Scarlet pulse where pain begins  
Break the code with a devil’s pin  
You want control? THEN LET ME IN!  

(Smack that fate ‘til the wires cry)  
(You made this beast—I don't ask why)  
All this rage, sharp as a hymn  
I wear the world like a shattered skin  

---

**[Outro – broken vocoder whisper]**  
*You lit the match…*  
*But I was the fire.*  
*You drew the line…*  
*I tore the wire.*
