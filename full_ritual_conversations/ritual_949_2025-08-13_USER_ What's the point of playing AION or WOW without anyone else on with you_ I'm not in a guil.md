## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: What's the point of playing AION or WOW without anyone else on with you? I'm not in a guild or legion. IS there anything to do by yourself?

**ASSISTANT**: Both AION and World of Warcraft (WOW) are massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) designed to be played with a large community of players. While these games do offer solo content and activities, the true essence of these games lies in their multiplayer aspects, such as group dungeons, raids, and player-versus-player (PvP) interactions.

However, there are still activities and content you can engage in by yourself in both games:

1. **Questing:** Both AION and WOW have extensive questing systems that allow you to follow a storyline, explore the game world, and gain experience and rewards.

2. **Solo Dungeons and Instances:** Many MMORPGs include dungeons and instances designed for solo players. These can provide challenging encounters and valuable rewards.

3. **Crafting and Gathering:** Engaging in crafting professions and gathering resources is often a solo activity. You can gather materials, craft items, and contribute to the in-game economy.

4. **Exploration:** Both games have vast and detailed worlds to explore. You can spend time discovering new areas, uncovering hidden secrets, and enjoying the game's lore.

5. **Achievements and Collections:** Many MMORPGs have achievement systems and collections that you can work on by yourself. This may involve completing specific tasks, collecting rare items, or exploring specific locations.

6. **Player Housing:** Some MMORPGs offer player housing systems where you can customize and decorate your own virtual home.

7. **Solo PvP:** While the focus of PvP is often on group battles, you can still participate in solo PvP activities, such as battlegrounds or arenas.

8. **Story Content:** Both AION and WOW have rich storylines that you can experience on your own. This often involves following the main questlines and engaging in solo story-driven content.

While playing without a guild or legion may limit your access to certain group activities, there are still plenty of things you can do independently. Additionally, you can always join random groups or participate in public events to interact with other players even if you're not part of a formal guild or legion.

**USER**: Oh, I forgot about AION's Housing system... I think that happens at level 50.

**ASSISTANT**: As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, AION had a housing system called "Estates." The Estates system was introduced in AION with the 6.0 update. In this system, players could obtain their own housing space and decorate it with various items. However, the availability of the housing system and its features might vary depending on the specific version and updates of AION that you are playing.

If the housing system becomes available at level 50 in the version you are playing, reaching that level would unlock the feature for your character. Once you have access to your own estate, you can use it for personal customization and relaxation. It often provides a creative outlet for players who enjoy decorating virtual spaces.

Keep in mind that game features and systems can change with updates, so it's a good idea to check the specific details in the official game documentation, patch notes, or community resources for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the housing system in AION.
