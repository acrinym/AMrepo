**USER**: I need some funny, new Facebook reel for Amanda I can send with a good morning

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s a fun idea for a **lighthearted, flirty Facebook Reel** to send Amanda with a **“Good Morning”** message:

### **Reel Concept:**  
**"How I Feel Waking Up Thinking About You"**

1. **Start with a Dramatic Yawn:**  
Record yourself doing an **over-the-top, exaggerated yawn** like you just woke up from the best sleep ever.

2. **Add Funny Music:**  
Use a trending, upbeat, or silly sound like:  
- **“Sunroof” by Nicky Youre & dazy** (feel-good vibe)  
- Or something playful like **“Can’t Stop the Feeling!”** by Justin Timberlake.

3. **Quick Scene Transition:**  
Snap your fingers or throw your blanket off dramatically, and suddenly you’re:  
- **Wearing sunglasses indoors.**  
- **Holding a cup of coffee like it’s the elixir of life.**  
- **Doing a little dance move, like finger guns or a goofy twirl.**

4. **Text Overlay:**  
“**POV: Woke up thinking about Amanda. Life = 1000% better. ☀️❤️**”

5. **End with a Funny Face:**  
Give the camera a cheesy wink or blow a dramatic kiss.

---

### **Caption to Send with It:**  
“**Good morning, Amanda! ☀️ Just out here thriving because you exist.**”

This adds charm, humor, and a sprinkle of affection without being too heavy. Plus, it’ll probably make her laugh first thing in the morning!

**USER**: Lol that would be perfect! Except, not yet. Just friends for now, but building something

**ASSISTANT**: Justin wants to keep things friendly with Amanda for now while building their connection gradually.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! When the time feels right, you’ll have the perfect reel idea ready to go. If you ever need more fun, friendly content to share as you build that connection, just let me know!

**USER**: I don't mean I don't want one, nevermind, I'm looking for one I can send today.

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! Here’s a **fun, friendly Reel idea** you can send Amanda **today** with a lighthearted “Good Morning” vibe:

### **Reel Concept:**  
**“Me Trying to Be Productive in the Morning”**

1. **Clip 1:**  
Record yourself looking super determined, like you’re ready to conquer the day.  
- Add text: **“Me: Today I’m going to be super productive.”**  

2. **Clip 2:**  
Cut to you dramatically **staring at the wall**, spinning in your chair, or **getting distracted by something random** (like pretending to talk to a plant or dancing with a coffee mug).  
- Add text: **“Also me: …but first, I need to think about life. And snacks. Mostly snacks.”**  

3. **Music Suggestion:**  
- **“The Office Theme Song”** (always funny and light)  
- Or a silly sound like **“Mission Impossible Theme”** while doing absolutely nothing productive.  

4. **End Scene:**  
Hold up your coffee with a wink and the text:  
**“Good morning! Hope your day’s more productive than mine. ☕”**

---

### **Caption to Send with It:**  
“**Morning vibes. Hope your day’s off to a strong start, unlike mine. 😎☕**”  

It’s friendly, funny, and keeps the tone light while making her smile first thing in the morning!
