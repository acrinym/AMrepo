**USER**: How do I install Unreal Gold GOG with Wine or Wine Ztricks or Proton? (not using Steam)

**ASSISTANT**: Installing Unreal Gold GOG with Wine or Wine Tricks involves a few steps. Here's a general guide to help you through the process. Please note that the steps may vary depending on your Linux distribution and system configuration.

### Prerequisites:

1. **Wine Installation:**
   Make sure you have Wine installed on your system. You can usually install it through your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install wine
   ```

2. **Download Unreal Gold from GOG:**
   Purchase and download the Unreal Gold game from the GOG website.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Navigate to the GOG Installer:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the GOG installer for Unreal Gold.

2. **Run the Installer with Wine:**
   Use the following command to run the GOG installer with Wine:

   ```bash
   wine setup_unreal_gold.exe
   ```
   Replace `setup_unreal_gold.exe` with the actual name of the GOG installer file.

3. **Follow the Installation Wizard:**
   The GOG installer should launch with Wine, and you'll see the installation wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

   Open Steam, go to "Library," and click on the "+ ADD A GAME" button at the bottom left. Choose "Add a Non-Steam Game" and select the Unreal Gold executable (Unreal.exe) in the game directory.

3. **Configure Proton:**
   Right-click on the newly added game in your Steam library, choose "Properties," and go to the "Compatibility" tab. Check the box that says "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool" and choose a Proton version from the dropdown menu.

4. **Run the Game:**
   Click "PLAY" in your Steam library to launch the game using Proton.

These instructions provide a general guide, and the details may vary depending on your specific Linux distribution and system configuration. Adjust the commands and steps accordingly based on your needs.

**USER**: When I try to run unreal tournament 2004 with steam proton, nothing actually launches, Steam says it is running for a moment, and then it says "play" again.

**ASSISTANT**: If Unreal Tournament 2004 is not launching properly with Steam Proton, there are several things you can try to troubleshoot and fix the issue. Here are some steps you can take:

### 1. Verify Game Files:

1. Right-click on Unreal Tournament 2004 in your Steam library.

### 2. Proton Compatibility:

1. Right-click on Unreal Tournament 2004 in your Steam library.
2. Select "Properties."
3. Go to the "Compatibility" tab.
4. Try different versions of Proton. You can experiment with both the latest version and older versions to see if one works better.

### 3. Launch Options:

1. Right-click on Unreal Tournament 2004 in your Steam library.
2. Select "Properties."
3. Go to the "General" tab.
4. Click on "SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."
5. Try adding the following launch options:

   ```
   PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%
   ```

   Click "OK" to apply the changes.

### 4. Wine Prefix Configuration:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the Steam Proton directory. This is typically in the Steam installation folder under `steamapps/common/Proton/`.
3. Go to the `compatibilitytools.d` directory.
4. Open the Proton version directory you are using (e.g., `Proton x.x`).
5. Inside that directory, open the `user_settings.sample` file using a text editor.
6. Add the following line:

   ```
   PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1
   ```

   Save the file.

### 5. Winecfg:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command to open Winecfg:

   ```bash
   winecfg
   ```

3. In the "Libraries" tab, add the following overrides:

   - `d3dx9`
   - `msvcrt`

   Click "Apply" and then "OK."

### 6. Log Files:

Check the Steam log files for any error messages. You can find these logs in the Steam installation directory under `steam/logs/content_log.txt`. Look for any error messages related to Unreal Tournament 2004.

### 7. Native Libraries:

Try using native libraries by replacing some of the game's DLL files with native Windows versions. This may require some trial and error.

### 8. Protontricks:

You can use the `protontricks` tool to apply various fixes and tweaks. Install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install protontricks
```

Then run:

```bash
protontricks <steam_appid> <command>
```

Replace `<steam_appid>` with the Steam App ID for Unreal Tournament 2004.

### 9. Community Discussions:

Check Steam community forums, Proton GitHub discussions, or other Linux gaming communities for specific solutions or workarounds that users might have found for Unreal Tournament 2004.

Remember to experiment with different combinations of these steps to find the solution that works best for your system.

**USER**: Where is the Steamapps folder in Ubuntu linux?

**ASSISTANT**: In Ubuntu and many other Linux distributions, the Steamapps folder is typically located within the Steam installation directory. The default path for the Steam installation directory on Ubuntu is:

```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps
```

Here's how you can access it using the command line:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the Steam installation directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.steam/steam
   ```

3. The `steamapps` folder should be within this directory.

Keep in mind that the `~` symbol represents your home directory. If you installed Steam in a different location, you would need to adjust the path accordingly.

If you are unable to find the Steam installation directory in the default location, you can use the `find` command to search for it:

```bash
find ~ -type d -name steam
```

This command will search for a directory named "steam" within your home directory (`~`). Once you locate the Steam directory, you can navigate to the `steam/steamapps` subdirectory as mentioned earlier.

**USER**: Changing the proton version and adding the prefixes you mentioned did not help to run unreal unfortunately.

**ASSISTANT**: If changing the Proton version and adding launch options did not resolve the issue with Unreal Tournament 2004, here are some additional steps and considerations you can try:

1. **OpenGL Compatibility:**
   Some games may have issues with DirectX under Proton. Try forcing the use of OpenGL instead by adding the following launch option:

   ```
   PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 PROTON_NO_D3D11=1 %command%
   ```

2. **Wine Debugging:**
   Enable Wine debugging to get more information about what might be causing the issue. Run the game with the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   WINEDEBUG=+all wine path/to/UnrealTournament2004.exe
   ```

   Replace `path/to/UnrealTournament2004.exe` with the actual path to your game executable.

3. **Install Additional Libraries:**
   Make sure you have installed necessary 32-bit libraries that the game might depend on. You can install them using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install lib32gcc1
   ```

4. **Clean Wine Prefix:**
   If you made several changes, it might be helpful to start with a clean Wine prefix. You can rename or delete the existing Wine prefix for the game, and then let Proton recreate it.

   ```bash
   mv ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/<game_appid> ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/<game_appid>_backup
   ```

   Replace `<game_appid>` with the actual Steam App ID for Unreal Tournament 2004.

5. **Community Discussions:**
   Check community forums, Steam discussions, or other Linux gaming communities for specific information regarding Unreal Tournament 2004. Other users may have encountered and solved similar issues.

6. **Proton GE:**
   Consider trying Proton GE, a community-maintained version of Proton that often includes additional patches and improvements. You can find it on GitHub: [Proton GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom)

7. **Update Graphics Drivers:**
   Ensure that your graphics drivers are up to date. Use the appropriate method for your graphics card (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) to install the latest drivers.

8. **Check System Logs:**
   Examine system logs for any error messages related to the game launch. You can use the `dmesg` and `journalctl` commands to check for system logs.

```bash
dmesg | grep -i wine
journalctl | grep -i wine
```

Remember to try these steps one at a time, and check if the issue is resolved after each attempt. If none of these solutions work, it might be beneficial to seek help from the community or the developers of Proton for more specific assistance.
