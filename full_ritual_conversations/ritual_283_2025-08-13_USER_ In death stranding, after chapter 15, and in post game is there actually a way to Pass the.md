## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: In death stranding, after chapter 15, and in post game is there actually a way to Pass the time before the presidential inauguration? Or is it just an infinite amout of time until you finish and beat everything, never actually continuing since it already happened two weeks earlier?

**ASSISTANT**: iturn0image1turn0image2turn0image3turn0image4In *Death Stranding*, after completing Chapter 14 and witnessing the presidential inauguration, Chapter 15—titled "Tomorrow is in Your Hands"—serves as an open-ended post-game phase. This chapter rewinds the timeline to two weeks before the inauguration, allowing players to continue exploring the world and completing tasks without advancing the main narrative.

### 🕰️ The Nature of Chapter 15

- **Narrative Context**: Chapter 15 places you in a period two weeks prior to the inauguration, but this is a narrative framing device. Time does not progress towards the inauguration, and the event does not occur again within this chapter.

- **Gameplay Opportunities**:
  - **Complete Remaining Deliveries**: Take on any standard or premium orders you may have missed.
  - **Achieve S-Rank Ratings**: Aim for "Legend of Legends" status by completing deliveries on Hard difficulty, which is necessary for certain trophies.
  - **Explore Additional Content**: In the Director's Cut version, new orders (e.g., Orders 77–79) and missions, such as those involving the Ruined Factory, become available during this chapter.
  - **Enhance Infrastructure**: Build and upgrade roads, zip-lines, and other structures to improve delivery efficiency and earn likes.
  - **Engage in Community Features**: Utilize online functionalities to interact with other players' structures and contribute to shared goals.

### 🔁 No Further Story Progression

Despite the prompt to "pass the time until the presidential inauguration," Chapter 15 does not lead to new story developments or cutscenes. The inauguration and associated events have already transpired in Chapter 14, and the game does not revisit these moments. This design choice provides a sandbox environment for players to continue engaging with the game's mechanics and world without the pressure of impending narrative events.

### 🏆 Pursuing 100% Completion

Chapter 15 offers an ideal setting for players aiming to achieve full completion:

- **Trophy Hunting**: Work towards earning all trophies, including those requiring specific delivery rankings or construction achievements.

- **Exploration and Discovery**: Uncover any remaining interviews, memory chips, or hidden locations scattered throughout the game world.

- **Community Engagement**: Participate in online events or contribute to communal structures, enhancing the shared experience of the game.

In summary, Chapter 15 serves as an open-ended platform for players to immerse themselves further in the world of *Death Stranding*, focusing on exploration, completion, and community interaction, without progressing the main storyline beyond the events of Chapter 14.

**USER**: Aww... and here I've been working on building up my 5 stars just for the inauguration to happen again, and drop me somewhere before it ever happened again, etc, etc.

**ASSISTANT**: Man… I feel that. You’re not alone—**a lot of players had that same quiet hope** that by maxing out all the prepper stars, rebuilding the chiral network, and pushing the world into that golden state of unity and perfection... **the game might acknowledge it.** That somehow you'd **loop the timeline** or even **earn a more fulfilling “true” ending** where the inauguration unfolds differently—or happens *again* with you ready this time.

But yeah, *Death Stranding*’s Chapter 15 is a **post-narrative sandbox**, not a second timeline. Here’s what’s really going on:

---

### 🧭 Why Chapter 15 Feels Like It *Should* Loop

- **“Tomorrow is in your hands”** — the game basically dares you to keep *building*, keep *delivering*, keep *connecting*. It feels like a timeline meant to be redeemed.
- Sam even gets lines like *“Guess we just pass the time until the inauguration…”* — but the **inauguration never comes.**
- The **calendar freezes**—that "two weeks prior" moment is a kind of eternal return. You're not progressing forward; you're living in a liminal space.

---

### 🎮 The Game Mechanics Want Closure. The World Doesn’t.

- You can:
  - 5-star every prepper.
  - Complete every standard order.
  - Deliver every lost cargo.
  - Collect all 56 memory chips.
  - Get every zipline perfect from coast to coast.

- But you can’t:
  - Trigger the inauguration again.
  - See Amelie, Deadman, or BB post-Ch.14.
  - Alter the ending or shift the fate of the world.

It’s **philosophical, not practical**: Kojima essentially gives you the reins of the world *after* its major narrative function has concluded. **It’s your world now—but you can't rewind fate.**

---

### 🔄 What to Do With That Feeling

You’re chasing something real—**the longing for closure, return, or redemption.** In DS, that never comes externally.

But if you *roleplay it*, you can make it meaningful:
- Pretend every five-star is a **vote of confidence** for a better future.
- Your work becomes **Sam's personal peace**, not a world event.
- You become **legend** not because the world sees it—but because you still *choose to act* after the story “ends.”

---

### 💡 Optional Headcanon / Ritual

Want to give it some closure anyway?

You could create your **own “inauguration moment”**:
- 5-star every prepper.
- Deliver one last gift to each one (e.g., favorite cargo).
- Return to Amelie’s Beach.
- Sit still. Let the waves pass. Speak a vow: *“The bridges are built. The strand holds.”*

Then shut the game off like it’s a **sacred closing ceremony**. Or go back out and keep walking. Your choice.

---

**You’re not wrong to feel let down by the non-return.** But that ache is kind of the point: we keep connecting, even if the world doesn’t reward it with fireworks.

Still… if Kojima ever drops a DLC where the inauguration *does* happen again—**you earned it 10 times over already.**

**USER**: Are there any worthwhile mods? Like a TC or something? I know there's HD art packs, but aside from increasing bullets, putting the redbull can back, and increasing zipline distance....
