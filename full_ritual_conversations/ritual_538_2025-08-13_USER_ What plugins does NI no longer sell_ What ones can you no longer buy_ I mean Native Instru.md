## FULL CONVERSATION CONTENT

**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: What plugins does NI no longer sell? What ones can you no longer buy? I mean Native Instruments

**TOOL**: **Unraveling plugin history**

I’m digging into the Native Instruments catalog to identify plugins they no longer sell. This involves examining their past offerings, which include discontinued products like Pro-53, B4, Kore 2, Vokator, Spektral Delay, and the Kore line.

**Tracing plugin shifts**

Native Instruments has phased out Absynth (circa 2022), B4 (v.2), Pro-53, Spektral Delay, Vokator, and Kore. Older instruments might have been updated or replaced.

**ASSISTANT**: Native Instruments (NI) has quite a storied past, with a handful of instruments and effects that—while once popular or even iconic—have been discontinued. Some of these disappeared quietly; others were explicitly replaced by newer offerings. Below is a rundown of the major NI plugins and products that are no longer officially sold or maintained by Native Instruments:

---

## 1. Absynth
**Discontinued:** 2022

**Overview:**  
Absynth was a long-standing semi-modular synth that specialized in evolving and layered soundscapes. It had a devoted following thanks to its unique granular and spectral synthesis capabilities. However, after many years of minimal updates, NI officially discontinued Absynth in 2022, and it’s no longer available to purchase.

---

## 2. Pro-53
**Discontinued:** 2009 (approx.)

**Overview:**  
A virtual analog classic, Pro-53 was the successor to the Pro-52, itself based on the famed Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. Pro-53 was beloved for its strong analog character. However, Native Instruments ultimately phased it out, presumably due to licensing changes with Dave Smith Instruments and to focus on newer synths in the NI lineup.

---

## 3. B4 & B4 II
**Discontinued:** Mid to Late 2000s

**Overview:**  
The B4 series was Native Instruments’ meticulously sampled tonewheel organ emulation, modeled on the classic Hammond B3. It was considered one of the best digital organ emulations for its time. Eventually, it got replaced by the “Vintage Organs” Kontakt library, and NI removed B4 from sale.

---

## 4. Vokator
**Discontinued:** 2000s

**Overview:**  
Vokator was a vocoder and advanced sound processor plugin capable of elaborate time-stretching and spectral manipulation. It was quite futuristic for its day but was eventually overshadowed by changes in the NI product line and by other instruments that had partial overlapping features.

---

## 5. Spektral Delay
**Discontinued:** 2000s

**Overview:**  
Spektral Delay was an effect plugin that offered real-time FFT-based spectral processing, letting you divide the incoming audio signal into individual frequency bands for elaborate delays. Like Vokator, it was removed from NI’s official lineup around the same time, presumably due to shifts in user demand and product focus.

---

## 6. Kore & Kore 2
**Discontinued:** Early 2010s

**Overview:**  
Kore was both hardware and software designed as a central “hub” for NI sounds, instruments, and effects. It allowed for patch morphing and was meant to unify the NI ecosystem under a single interface. Despite strong initial hype, NI replaced Kore’s core functionality with the Maschine and Komplete Kontrol platforms, leading to Kore’s complete discontinuation.

---

## 7. Bandstand
**Discontinued:** 2000s

**Overview:**  
Bandstand was a GM (General MIDI) sound library that provided a broad palette of GM-compliant instruments. It wasn’t as widely adopted as NI’s more specialized instruments, and with GM libraries becoming less of a focus in modern production, NI ultimately removed Bandstand from the store.

---

### Honorable Mention: Legacy Versions and Bundles

- **Reaktor Session** (a stripped-down version of Reaktor) is long since superseded by the fully fledged Reaktor.  
- Early Komplete bundles included some of the above instruments before NI’s lineup was consolidated and older titles were phased out.

---

## Where to Find Them Now?
Though official sales have been discontinued, you can sometimes find old license transfers on third-party marketplaces like KVR Audio or from individual sellers looking to pass along their serials (if NI’s license transfer policy allows it). Beware that NI provides no official updates or support for these legacy products, and compatibility with newer operating systems can be hit or miss.

---

### Final Thoughts
Discontinuing older or lower-demand instruments is not unique to Native Instruments; many audio companies constantly reshuffle their product lines to keep up with evolving technology. The good news is that NI frequently introduces new synths, effects, and libraries—so while some classics fade away, new ones emerge that can often outperform or expand upon the original in new and exciting ways. 

If you have a particular nostalgic love for one of these discontinued plugins, your best bet is to track down a second-hand license and prepare a compatible setup (often an older operating system and DAW version) to keep the memory of these NI gems alive.

**USER**: What recent plugins has Cakewalk discontinued?

**TOOL**: **Assessing recent changes**

Cakewalk, under BandLab's ownership, has moved away from some older SONAR plugins like Rapture, Dimension Pro, and Z3TA+.

**Taking a closer look**

Hmm, I wonder if BandLab has kept older SONAR plugins like Sonitus FX alive. Since Cakewalk's current version is free, older paid expansions might have been shelved.

**Revisiting discontinued plugins**

It's interesting to see that BandLab's Cakewalk skipped Rapture, Dimension Pro, and Z3TA+ 2. Some older exclusives like SONAR Platinum's expansions might also be history.

**Mapping discontinued plugins**

I'm piecing together Cakewalk's trends, including Rapture, Dimension, and Session Drummer, and noting software transitions like V-Vocal to Melodyne.

**ASSISTANT**: Cakewalk (the company) has gone through multiple transitions over the past decade, from being owned by Gibson to subsequently being acquired by BandLab in 2018. Throughout these changes, several Cakewalk-branded plugins (especially those bundled with older SONAR versions) have been left behind. While BandLab’s free Cakewalk DAW continues to include a core set of effects and instruments, some of the more advanced or premium plugins have been discontinued or are simply no longer offered for separate purchase.

Below is an overview of Cakewalk-related plugins that have effectively been discontinued or are no longer developed and sold:

---

## 1. Rapture Pro
**Status:** Discontinued around 2017–2018 (prior to the BandLab acquisition)  
**Overview:**  
Rapture Pro was an evolution of the original Rapture instrument, merging functionality from Dimension Pro and Rapture into a single flagship synthesizer/sample-based instrument. After Gibson ceased Cakewalk’s operations, Rapture Pro was no longer developed or sold. BandLab did not revive or continue Rapture Pro when relaunching Cakewalk as a free DAW.

---

## 2. Dimension Pro
**Status:** Discontinued (after Gibson’s closure of Cakewalk)  
**Overview:**  
Dimension Pro was one of Cakewalk’s longest-standing virtual instruments—a powerful sample-based synthesizer offering a large library of sounds. Although BandLab’s Cakewalk still supports Dimension Pro if you already own it, the instrument itself is no longer available for new purchase or official updates.

---

## 3. Z3TA+ & Z3TA+ 2
**Status:** Discontinued (no longer sold through Cakewalk/BandLab)  
**Overview:**  
Z3TA+ was a highly regarded waveshaping synth that gained a substantial following for its distinctive sound design capabilities. Z3TA+ 2 introduced a more modern interface and additional features. When Gibson shut down Cakewalk, official sales ended. Though you might still find old license keys in third-party marketplaces, the plugin is no longer officially distributed by Cakewalk/BandLab.

---

## 4. Cakewalk Sound Center & Expansion Packs
**Status:** Legacy products (bundled with older SONAR editions, no standalone sales)  
**Overview:**  
Cakewalk Sound Center was a rompler-style plugin included in older SONAR editions, sometimes accompanied by expansion packs. While not as advanced as Dimension Pro, it provided basic GM and instrument patches. BandLab’s Cakewalk does not offer it for separate download or sale, and updates have not been released for many years.

---

## 5. Session Drummer 3
**Status:** Discontinued (no new sales)  
**Overview:**  
Session Drummer 3 was Cakewalk’s in-house drum sampler plugin included in certain SONAR bundles. It had various kits and MIDI patterns. Although BandLab’s Cakewalk includes some integrated drum options (e.g., the Studio Instruments Drum Kit for basic sketches), Session Drummer 3 itself was phased out and is not separately offered.

---

## 6. Perfect Space (Convolution Reverb)
**Status:** Discontinued (no longer bundled)  
**Overview:**  
Perfect Space was a third-party reverb plugin (licensed from Voxengo under the name “Pristine Space”) that came bundled with older SONAR versions. After the switch to BandLab, Perfect Space was no longer included as a built-in effect, and there’s no official re-release of it in the current Cakewalk DAW.

---

## 7. Legacy ProChannel Modules
**Status:** Some are discontinued / no longer for sale  
**Overview:**  
Cakewalk’s SONAR Platinum included special ProChannel modules (like the CA-2A T-Type Leveling Amplifier, PC4K S-Type Expander/Gate, etc.). While BandLab’s Cakewalk maintains basic ProChannel functionality, certain premium or 3rd-party-licensed modules that used to be sold separately are no longer officially available or updated.

---

### Are Any of These Still Obtainable?
- **Old License Transfers**: Sometimes you can find legitimate secondhand licenses (for Z3TA+, Dimension Pro, etc.) that individuals are willing to sell or transfer, but the legality and success of reauthorizing them can vary depending on the plugin and old Cakewalk activation servers.  
- **Already Owned SONAR Content**: If you had a SONAR account with previous installs/serial numbers from the Gibson or Roland eras, you may still be able to download or install older plugins within BandLab’s Cakewalk, but new official purchases are not possible.

---

### In Summary
When BandLab resurrected Cakewalk as a free product, it focused on the core DAW and essential stock plugins rather than reviving or continuing all the older paid plugins. Consequently, instruments like Rapture Pro, Dimension Pro, and Z3TA+ (along with various bundled expansions) are effectively discontinued. If you didn’t acquire them before Cakewalk’s shift from Gibson to BandLab, there is no authorized source to purchase them anymore—and there have been no updates or re-releases since their discontinuation.

**USER**: What are some synth VSTS that are well known that are discontinued (minus Nexus and Nexus 2)

**TOOL**: ### Reflecting on discontinued synth VSTs

I'm working through popular synthesizer VSTs from earlier years that are no longer available, like Pro-53, Camel Audio Alchemy (Windows version), and Hypersonic, among others.

### Identifying discontinued synth VSTs

I’m gathering info on discontinued synth VSTs like NI Pro-53, Camel Audio's Alchemy, Steinberg's Hypersonic 2, and ReFX Vanguard (reintroduced as Vanguard 2), excluding ReFX Nexus.

**Clarifying the criteria**

Keeping the focus on well-known discontinued synth VSTs, like Steinberg's Embracer and Monologue from the 32-bit era, and excluding Edirol Orchestral since it's more of a GM library.

**Highlighting notable discontinuations**

I'm mapping out key discontinued synth VSTs like NI Pro-53, Camel Audio's Alchemy, and Steinberg's Hypersonic 2. Absynth's 2022 discontinuation is also significant, along with other notable mentions.

**ASSISTANT**: Below is a curated list of once-popular, now-discontinued (or at least no longer available for new purchases) synth VSTs. I’ve left out Nexus/Nexus 2, as you specifically requested. Keep in mind that while some of these were “fully discontinued,” others live on in updated forms or got folded into other products, so “discontinued” might mean “no longer sold as a separate plugin.”

---

## 1. Camel Audio Alchemy (Windows Version)
**Status:** Discontinued for Windows in 2015 (acquired by Apple)  
**Overview:**  
- Alchemy was famous for its advanced sample-manipulation and virtual analog capabilities, plus granular and spectral synthesis.  
- When Apple purchased Camel Audio in 2015, Alchemy became an exclusive part of Logic Pro.  
- Windows users can no longer buy a standalone version of Alchemy, making the original cross-platform VST effectively discontinued.

---

## 2. Steinberg Hypersonic 2
**Status:** Discontinued mid-2000s  
**Overview:**  
- Hypersonic 2 was a ROMpler-meets-synth workstation that offered a massive library of bread-and-butter sounds as well as synth patches.  
- Steinberg ended development and sales after splitting from Wizoo (the developer behind Hypersonic) years ago.  
- Some fans still pine for it, but official licenses can only be found secondhand, and it’s no longer updated.

---

## 3. Native Instruments Pro-53
**Status:** Discontinued around 2009  
**Overview:**  
- Pro-53 was an homage to the classic Sequential Circuits Prophet-5.  
- Its analog-modeled engine made it a go-to for many producers seeking a vintage Prophet vibe.  
- NI eventually dropped it from the product line, likely due to licensing agreements and the shift toward more modern synth engines.

---

## 4. Native Instruments Absynth
**Status:** Discontinued in 2022  
**Overview:**  
- Though not as “traditional” a subtractive synth, Absynth’s semi-modular approach, sample-based oscillators, and powerful spectral morphing made it a legend in the ambient and cinematic space.  
- NI quietly removed it from sale after years of minimal updates, leading many longtime fans to lament the end of this uniquely capable instrument.

---

## 5. reFX Vanguard (Original Version)
**Status:** Original version was discontinued; replaced by Vanguard 2 in 2022  
**Overview:**  
- The original Vanguard had a strong following in the trance, EDM, and dance music production community thanks to its easy, big-sounding supersaw leads and arpeggiators.  
- reFX ended sales/support of the original Vanguard for quite some time.  
- Vanguard 2 was released in 2022, but the original is no longer available for purchase or supported.

---

## Bonus Mentions

### Spectrasonics Atmosphere
- **Replaced by**: Omnisphere  
- Atmosphere was a beloved “dream synth” focused on lush pads and atmospheric soundscapes, but Spectrasonics retired it when they introduced Omnisphere. While Omnisphere is considered the rightful successor with all of Atmosphere’s sonic palette (and more), the original plugin no longer has an official purchase path.

### Cakewalk Z3TA+ (and Z3TA+ 2)
- **Status**: Discontinued by Cakewalk after its acquisition turmoil  
- A waveshaping powerhouse and a staple for many trance/EDM producers. Although Z3TA+ 2 was sold for a while, once Gibson shut down Cakewalk, new licenses became unavailable. BandLab didn’t resume its sale.

## Finding Discontinued Gems
If you’re set on tracking down any of these discontinued synths, your best chance is often a legitimate secondhand license (if the developer still has a license-transfer policy in place) or using older installers you already own. There can be compatibility issues with modern operating systems and DAWs—so plan on setting up an environment that can still run these classics.

While it’s a bummer to lose beloved plugins, many have updated successors or alternative instruments that surpass them in features, stability, and integration with modern workflows. Still, for nostalgic producers or sound designers chasing specific sonic quirks, these discontinued synths remain forever special.

**USER**: What other Minamalistic VSTS were discontinued....recently?

**ASSISTANT**: Several minimalist VSTs have been discontinued in recent years, often replaced by more complex offerings or simply abandoned due to shifting market demands. These lightweight synths or plugins typically focused on specific tasks, simple interfaces, or streamlined functionality, making them beloved by producers looking for quick and easy sound design tools. Here’s a list of minimalist VSTs that have been discontinued relatively recently:

---

## Where Minimalism is Headed:
Minimalist VSTs are becoming rare as modern plugins trend toward feature richness and "all-in-one" solutions. However, demand for lightweight tools still exists, and some developers focus on streamlined, niche instruments and effects that continue the minimalist tradition. 

If you’re nostalgic for these lightweight tools, legacy versions might still work in older setups, or newer minimalist plugins (like *Baby Audio’s free tools* or *TAL’s range of synths*) can offer similar functionality.
