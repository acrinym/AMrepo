**NO SUMMARIZATION - COMPLETE DETAILS BELOW**

**USER**: In Control, how do I find a way into the room to bind the X-ray light box

**ASSISTANT**: To access the room with the X-ray light box in *Control* and bind the Object of Power, you'll need to complete a specific sequence of actions:

1. **Reach the Research Sector:** Make your way to the Research Sector. The X-ray light box is located in the *Hypnosis Lab*, which you can find in the *Parapsychology* section of the Research Sector.

2. **Clear the Area:** Before you can enter the Hypnosis Lab, you'll likely encounter some Hiss enemies. Clear them out to safely explore the area.

3. **Locate the Hypnosis Lab:** Once you've dealt with the enemies, find the Hypnosis Lab door. It might be locked initially, but you'll need to find a way to unlock it.

4. **Power the Door:** To unlock the door, you need to find and interact with the power supply. Look for a power generator nearby that requires power cores. You'll find the power cores in the vicinity. Pick them up using your Launch ability and place them into the generator.

5. **Enter the Hypnosis Lab:** Once the door is powered and unlocked, enter the Hypnosis Lab. Inside, you'll find the X-ray light box Object of Power.

6. **Bind the Object of Power:** Interact with the X-ray light box to begin the binding process. This will trigger an Astral Plane challenge, where you'll need to complete a sequence to bind the Object of Power and gain a new ability.

After completing the challenge, the X-ray light box will be bound, and you'll gain a new ability, which can help you in your journey through *Control*.

Let me know if you need more detailed steps or further assistance!

**USER**: You need to interact with power cores and stuff? Where are they? Where is the generator

**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for the confusion earlier. In *Control*, to access the room containing the X-ray light box Object of Power, you don't need to interact with power cores or generators. Instead, you’ll need to find the correct path to the room. Here's a detailed guide to help you get there:

### Steps to Access the X-ray Light Box

1. **Navigate to the Parapsychology Area:**
   - Head to the Research Sector, and from there, navigate towards the Parapsychology area. This is where you’ll find the Hypnosis Lab, which contains the X-ray light box.

2. **Locate the Hypnosis Lab:**
   - Once you're in the Parapsychology area, keep an eye out for signs pointing to the Hypnosis Lab. The lab is located off the main hallway in Parapsychology.

3. **Finding the X-ray Light Box Room:**
   - As you approach the Hypnosis Lab, you’ll notice that the door to the room where the X-ray light box is located is closed and might appear locked.

4. **Interact with the Door:**
   - Simply approach the door to open it. There is no need for power cores or a generator. However, if the door is locked, it might require a keycard, or you may need to clear nearby enemies first.

5. **Binding the Object of Power:**
   - Once inside, you’ll find the X-ray light box. Interact with it to initiate the binding process. This will transport you to the Astral Plane, where you must complete a challenge to bind the Object of Power.

6. **Completing the Astral Plane Challenge:**
   - The challenge in the Astral Plane typically involves navigating a series of platforms and potentially dealing with enemies. Complete the challenge, and you’ll successfully bind the X-ray light box, gaining a new ability.

### Notes:
- The Hypnosis Lab door should open automatically once you reach it, assuming you’ve progressed far enough in the game.
- If the door is locked or doesn’t open, ensure you’ve cleared any nearby enemies or that you have the required clearance level.
- Binding the X-ray light box grants you the Seize ability, allowing you to take control of weakened enemies in combat.

If you're having trouble finding the lab or if the door is not opening as expected, let me know, and I can provide more specific guidance!

**USER**: Yes the doors locked, it doesn't have any power. Although the way to open the door is apparently plugged in so I'm not really sure how it's lacking power so I think you're missing something

**ASSISTANT**: Justin is currently playing Control and is attempting to access the room with the X-ray light box, but the door is locked due to a lack of power.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the clarification. If the door is locked due to a lack of power, you’re right that there’s a specific mechanism you need to engage to restore power to open it. Here’s how you can resolve this:

1. **Locate the Power Cores:**
   - Near the Hypnosis Lab or along the path leading to it, you should find power cores. These are blue glowing cubes that you can interact with using your Launch ability. They are usually placed in wall sockets or power devices nearby.

2. **Insert the Power Cores:**
   - Look for a power socket or generator near the door that’s locked. There should be one or more empty slots where you need to place the power cores. Use your Launch ability to pick up a power core and insert it into the socket. This should restore power to the door.

3. **Check Nearby Rooms:**
   - If you don’t see any power cores immediately near the door, check nearby rooms or areas for power cores. Sometimes they’re placed a little bit away from where you need them.

4. **Return to the Door:**
   - Once you’ve inserted the power core(s) and restored power, the door should unlock, allowing you access to the Hypnosis Lab.

5. **Bind the X-ray Light Box:**
   - After gaining access, you can interact with the X-ray light box and bind it as mentioned before.

If the power core isn’t immediately visible or if you’re still having trouble, try retracing your steps back to where you first entered the Parapsychology area, as sometimes power cores can be found along the way or in adjacent rooms.

Let me know if this helps or if you need further guidance!
