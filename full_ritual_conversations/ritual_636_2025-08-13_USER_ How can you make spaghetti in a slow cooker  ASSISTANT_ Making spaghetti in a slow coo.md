**USER**: How can you make spaghetti in a slow cooker

**ASSISTANT**: Making spaghetti in a slow cooker is an easy and convenient method, especially if you're looking for a "set it and forget it" option. Here's how you can do it:

### Ingredients:
- 1 pound of ground beef, turkey, or sausage (optional)
- 1 jar (24 oz) of spaghetti sauce
- 1 can (14 oz) of diced tomatoes (optional)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 cup water or beef broth (for extra flavor)
- 8 oz uncooked spaghetti noodles (break in half if needed)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: grated Parmesan cheese or fresh basil for garnish

### Instructions:

#### 1. **Prepare the Meat (Optional)**:
   - If using ground meat, cook it in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Drain excess grease.

#### 2. **Layer the Ingredients**:
   - In the slow cooker, pour a thin layer of spaghetti sauce at the bottom.
   - Add the cooked ground meat (if using) and evenly spread it.
   - Pour the remaining spaghetti sauce and diced tomatoes on top of the meat.
   - Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.

#### 3. **Add the Pasta**:
   - Break the uncooked spaghetti noodles in half and place them on top of the sauce mixture. Make sure they are spread out evenly to prevent clumping.

#### 4. **Add Liquid**:
   - Pour the water or broth over the noodles, ensuring they are fully covered. You can gently press the noodles into the sauce, but don't stir too much.

#### 5. **Cook**:
   - Cover and cook on **low** for 2-4 hours or **high** for 1-2 hours. Check occasionally to ensure the noodles are not sticking together and that they are cooking evenly. You may need to stir gently once or twice during cooking.

#### 6. **Check Doneness**:
   - Once the noodles are tender and the sauce is heated through, your spaghetti is ready to serve. Adjust seasoning if needed.

#### 7. **Serve**:
   - Scoop the spaghetti onto plates or bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil, if desired.

### Tips:
- For extra vegetables, you can add diced bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms to the sauce mixture.
- Avoid overcooking, as the noodles can become mushy if left in the slow cooker too long.
- If you prefer a creamier texture, stir in a bit of cream or shredded cheese just before serving. 

This method simplifies the process and keeps cleanup to a minimum!
