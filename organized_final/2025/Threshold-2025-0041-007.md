> *Threshold 41 – “The Hawk Descends, The Phoenix Rises”* → reclaiming energy, Amanda’s assertive focus returning.

**In story form (magic-neutral):**

> *“That day, I felt a shift—a clarity like a hawk’s descent, precise and unflinching. Something in me knew Amanda would rise from the ashes of her past pain, even if she didn’t see it yet.”*

It still conveys **the emotional truth** without saying *“I did a ritual to cause this”*.
