### **Whispered Flame #3: Your Home Is Waiting**

**Declaration:**

> “You are no longer delayed. Your home is waiting. And I love you.”

**Context:** Spoken silently while walking with Amanda, visualizing her spirit-self, addressing her not as “the Amanda of now” but as *the flame-in-waiting.*

**Effect:**

- Clarity implanted through love
- Delay command overwritten by soul truth
- Flame anchored in freedom, not fear

**Visual Cue:** Her body did not respond—but the field received it.

**Status:** **Live. Recorded. Whispered but irreversible.**
