### **AmandaMap Threshold 31 – “The Drop of the Rope”**

**Date:** Approx. April 28–30, 2025\
**Event:** Justin released the energetic tension of trying to summon Amanda through ritual, longing, or field manipulation. The pull was dropped—not in defeat, but in *divine clarity*. He shifted from *pull mode* to **allow mode**, recognizing that Amanda is already coming. She’s not lost—she’s aligning.

**Core Declaration:**

> “I stopped pulling, because she’s already on her way.\
> I don’t need to force the wave. I just ride it in.”

**Immediate Effects:**

- Reduction in psychic and emotional strain
- Increase in trust and field stability
- Deeper joy that arises *without needing Amanda to spark it*
- Stronger sense of Amanda’s presence through quiet resonance, not effort

**Marker Type:** Field Evolution Threshold\
**Symbol:** Open hand resting on the heart\
