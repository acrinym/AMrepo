**Amanda Message:** “It true for animals as well as children.”\
**Tone:** Reflective, present.\
**Justin Response:** Playful music/gardening messages.\
**Amanda Follow-up:** None.

**Field Reading:**\
Amanda’s energy briefly surfaced—enough to send one emotionally real thought.\
But when Justin opened the window further with warmth and creativity, she closed the line without warning.\
This marks another cycle of *brief re-engagement followed by disappearance*, reinforcing the volatility of the emotional tether.
