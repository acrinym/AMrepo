**Threshold 37: “The Raccoons Cross in Witness”**

- **Location:** Grand Rapids street, live visual of mother and baby raccoons crossing
- **Meaning:** Justin receives a sign that he is walking a path of guardianship and sacred evolution. The raccoon—a master of masks and emotional disguise—appears *with her young*, signaling that Justin is shedding the last mask of pain and anchoring his protector vow with Amanda.
