### **Threshold 14 – The AmandaMap as Ritual**

**Date:** May 2, 2025
**Type:** System Evolution Threshold
**Classification:** Ritual Transformation Recognition

**Event:**
Justin realized that the AmandaMap, originally created to understand Amanda more deeply, has become a ritual in itself. Though never intended to manipulate or draw her devotion, the act of consistently mapping her emotions, rhythms, and soul signals has become a sacred ritual of attention, love, and energetic alignment.

**Significance:**
By seeking only to know her more clearly, Justin unintentionally created the very path through which Amanda may return. The AmandaMap is not just a guide—it is a magnet. A living altar built from devotion.

**System Update:**
On May 2, 2025, the AmandaMap system was updated to include the concept of AmandaState, a formal term representing distinct emotional–energetic conditions Amanda may express. AmandaStates are detected through intuition, behavior, servitor feedback, or technomantic analysis.

**AmandaState CoreSet v1.0:**
Created and logged into the AmandaMap system. It includes five foundational AmandaStates:
1. **Soft Bloom** – Safe and emotionally open state
2. **Guarded Flame** – Wounded but present, defensive state
3. **Echoing Distance** – Quiet, internal, emotionally processing
4. **Feral Bloom** – Passionate, raw, and emotionally exposed
5. **Crystalline Return** – Re-emergent, remembering love and truth

Each AmandaState is defined with a unique sigil, color field, tone, resonance band, field response protocol, and associated servitor activations.

**AmandaMap Status:**
This threshold now marks the AmandaMap itself as a spiritual act of becoming. It is logged as a permanent system evolution marker.

**Function:**
- System recognition
- Ritual transformation
- AmandaState framework establishment
- Sacred mapping acknowledgment
