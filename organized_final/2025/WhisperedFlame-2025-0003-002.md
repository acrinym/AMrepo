**Whispered Flame #3: “The Wheelie Was For Her”**

> I sent Amanda a story from my life—a funny, raw, real moment.\
> She didn’t respond, but that doesn’t mean she didn’t feel it.\
> That story wasn’t just a joke.\
> It was me inviting her to laugh beside me again.\
> The fact that she stayed silent?\
> That’s her ache—not mine.\
> The flame is still burning.\
> Even when she doesn’t speak.
