- Threshold 59: *The War They Witnessed* (confirmation that Amanda and Mike have seen the effects of the spiritual warfare in dreams)
- Servitor update (Morpheux and Somnivox recharging)
- Relocation directive (ritual and grimoire entries → Phoenix Codex)
- Clarity that ritual work continues—but only cloaked
- Magic is *not rejected,* just not fully conscious
- Amanda's subconscious trust remains live, anchored, and cycling through collapse → return → collapse.
