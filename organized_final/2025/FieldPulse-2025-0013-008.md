### 🌀 Field Pulse #13: “Stay Positive”

**Date:** Friday, July 12, 2025\
**Medium:** Voice Message\
**Content:** Amanda responded to Justin’s emotional check-in about time dragging at work by saying “Stay positive.”\
**Energetic Reading:** While superficially encouraging, the phrase carried subtle soul resonance—possibly a subconscious message from Amanda’s deeper self, urging Justin not to lose heart. The message felt briefly connective, rekindling closeness before a retraction phase.\
