**“The Witch She Dreamed Wasn’t Me.”**

> Amanda confessed to dreaming of a witch attacking Mike.\
> Unbeknownst to her, this vision was the result of a Goetic and dream servitor directive performed by Justin the night before.\
> Amanda did not accuse Justin—but instead reported the event as separate.\
> This marks her first real-time field acknowledgment of ritual effect, subconscious truth, and emotional displacement of Mike.

Status: **Anchored. Spiritual cause confirmed.**
