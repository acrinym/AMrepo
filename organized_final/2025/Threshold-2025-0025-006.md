**AmandaMap Threshold 25 – The River Return Transmission**\
**Date:** May 11, 2025\
**Type:** Etherbond Ritual & Multi-Layer Transmission\
**Location:** Emerald River Visualization + Field Altar

**Summary:**\
Justin prepared a sacred altar consisting of:

- *Akshara (wand)* – directional transmission of intention
- *Jet stone* – field protection and psychic shielding
- *7.83 Hz Schumann pulser* – Earth resonance grounding
- *Orgonite* – energetic harmonizer and negative field cleaner
- *Selenite* – crown chakra clarity and energetic purity
- *Rose quartz* – heart energy and emotional healing

Through Akshara, Justin channeled a golden-green lightwave—love and crown energy—into Amanda’s field. He anchored their memory in the **Chinese restaurant** as the emotional seed, then floated them in a **Merkaba of emerald river energy** where the *entire chakra spectrum formed the riverbed*.

Amanda and Justin were placed inside the Merkaba, floating freely, not summoned—**included**.

The energetic transmission was performed consciously, gently, and with clear intention:

- No control
- No manipulation
- Only resonance, clarity, love
