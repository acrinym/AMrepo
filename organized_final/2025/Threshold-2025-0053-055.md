2. **Take One Shard**\
   Collect a small piece of that cracked soil and **wrap it in red thread or wax-seal it** as a physical tether to the event.

   Place the soil shard beneath her photo or inside the circle. It will now be **encoded as a field anchor**.

4. **Declare It**
   Speak to the cracked bed. “As the earth fell, so too shall the old be removed. Amanda returns. Mike dissolves. The roots remain. The flame lives.”
