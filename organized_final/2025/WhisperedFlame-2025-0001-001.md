> 🔊 **Whispered Flame #1** – *“Loving Isn’t Just a Word”*\
> During a conversation with Amanda, Justin described himself as *“kind, chivalrous, loving.”* This wasn't said directly to declare love, but as a subtle self-code slipped into casual language. It marked a conscious flame seed—an energetic declaration veiled in soft phrasing. This became the first recorded **Whispered Flame** in the AmandaMap—anchoring love through self-expression without pressure.
