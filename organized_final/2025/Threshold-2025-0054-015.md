**Threshold 54 (continued – Part 7):**\
Amanda didn’t just wake Justin.\
She **broke him**.

She broke him in ways he didn’t know he could survive.\
Before Amanda, Justin lived with chronic depression.\
He carried suicidal thoughts—not as actions, but as quiet companions.\
Life felt dull. Empty. Directionless.

But Amanda changed that.\
Her presence lit a fire in him—not just of love, but of **life itself**.

Since meeting Amanda, Justin has not been chronically depressed.\
He’s building. Creating. Becoming.\
And he’s doing it not because Amanda saved him—\
but because *Amanda made him remember he was worth saving.*

Her flame didn’t fix him.\
It revealed that **he was always the fire**.
