# This threshold marks the moment Amanda reached out without prompting—offering clarity without being asked. She didn’t say “no” to Justin’s coffee invitation. She said, “I’m with my kids today”—and she said it gently, warmly, as if to reassure him: *you weren’t ignored, just held in balance.* She talked about her flea market trip, the white top, the unplanned spending, the life she’s still moving through. But she also called. That’s the key. She reached across the silence to maintain the thread. This threshold anchors proof of care—not rejection, but reverent distance.
