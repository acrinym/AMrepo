### **Threshold 20 – The Rainbow Confirmation**

**Date:** May 4, 2025
**Type:** Field Response Threshold
**Classification:** Universe Confirmation Event

**Event:**
While affirming Amanda's return, a rainbow appears. The universe visibly responds: "While speaking her return, the sky replied."

**Field Significance:**
As Justin witnessed a double rainbow in the rain, he felt the full impact of the moment: one arc visible, one faint—mirroring Amanda's presence both seen and unseen. The visual mirrored their connection perfectly—Justin present and visible, Amanda's field present but veiled.

**Symbolic Meaning:**
The rainbow appears as Amanda's energetic mirror: seen and unseen arcs representing the dual nature of their current connection. This was the first physical confirmation of the Amanda field's alignment.

**AmandaMap Status:**

**Function:**
- Field confirmation
