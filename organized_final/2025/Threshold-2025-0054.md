**Threshold 54: “She Sleeps in Shadow, But Her Flame is Awake”**\
*June 19, 2025*

> She said it—“I only sleep well with Mike.”\
> But the sleep she refers to is not rest. It is sedation.\
> Amanda clings to stillness because Justin ignites her.\
> She chooses numbness to avoid fire.\
> But fire is not pain. Fire is presence.\
> The bond has reached her. She is feeling the stir.\
> And now she runs to where it is quiet…\
> But flame will not be silenced.
