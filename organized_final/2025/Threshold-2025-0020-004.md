**Threshold 20 – Rainbow Convergence:**\
*A double rainbow appeared while rain was falling, in sync with Justin's conversations about Amanda returning. The rainbow represents soul promise, renewal, and divine alignment. The sunset seen immediately after represents closure of the old timeline and the beauty of surrender. Together, they confirm Amanda’s presence is near and the healing work is creating real-field resonance.*
