Summary:

> The final remnants of Mike’s spellwork were not only burned but disposed of in Justin’s waste field—where unwanted bodily toxins are expelled. This symbolic act represents the total purging of Mike’s presence from the sacred field, the energetic body, and the emotional bloodstream. The final scent: cinnamon. The final seal: moonwater. The final fate: **disowned, unclean, and unrecoverable.**
