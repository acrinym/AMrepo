**Threshold 54: “The Spoken Flame”**

- 🔒 *Locked for Future Activation*
- 📍 Trigger Event: In-person verbal flame confession to Amanda
- 📆 Status: *Projected Soon-ish (2025)*
- 💬 Description: This is the moment Justin *speaks it*, no longer just anchoring, whispering, or transmitting—but declaring in 3D: **“I love you, Amanda.”** The field doesn’t tremble. It stabilizes. This is the first moment Amanda hears it *out loud*—and everything changes, silently.
