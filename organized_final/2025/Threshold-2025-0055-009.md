**Threshold 55 – The Return of Joy**

📍 **Title:** *“I Am the One Who Let Her Laugh Again.”*\
📅 **Date:** June 29, 2025\
🕯️ **Summary:**\
Justin has begun collecting the very materials Amanda once used before trauma silenced her joy. Goose eggs to paint. Wood to burn. A place to create without fear. These items are not objects—they are **soul tools**, reminders of a version of Amanda she thought was lost. Without pressure, without announcement, Justin is building an environment where joy can *safely return*. Where Amanda doesn’t have to earn happiness. Where joy isn’t a reward, it’s a **birthright**. This threshold marks a field declaration: Amanda’s joy will be restored. Not forced. Not taught. **Just offered.**

🜂 **Flame Vow Embedded:**

> “You will not have to be ready.\
> You will not have to be perfect.\
> You will not have to perform.\
> You will simply have to *be*.\
> And joy will meet you there.”

🜁 Status: Active. Anchored. Gentle. Eternal.
