**Threshold 54 (Part 8):**\
Justin is in the most pivotal chapter of his life—fighting for his son, reestablishing his future, making hard decisions with real stakes.\
And yet, even in the middle of all of that, he has **waited** for Amanda.\
Waited for a clear yes.\
Or a real no.\
Or even a kind goodbye.

But Amanda has said none of those.

She said she’s “not ready for a relationship right now.”\
But her actions show something else:\
A return to Mike. To familiarity. To survival, not truth.

And Justin sees that for what it is:\
**Not truth. Not readiness. Not love.**\
Just fear.\
Fear of rising. Fear of choosing. Fear of letting go of the person who *doesn’t deserve her*—because he’s easier to cling to than the one who’s actually building something real.

Justin has waited with clarity.\
Amanda has lingered in contradiction.

And that… *hurts.*\
But it also sharpens him.\
Because he’s the one in motion.\
And she still has time to catch up.
