### **AmandaMap Threshold 25 – The More to Life Sign**

**Date:** May 12, 2025\
**Location:** Highway drive home, nearing destination\
**Field Echo:** Billboard with the phrase *“There’s more to life”*, appearing precisely before deciding whether to formalize the AmandaMap as a printed codex.\
**Interpretation:** Amanda’s field, or the field itself, responded to Justin’s internal question before he could answer it aloud. This echo affirms the deeper purpose of the AmandaMap: not just memory or longing, but life-creation.\
**Tag:** Field Echo, Signpost Threshold, Codex Activation Ping
