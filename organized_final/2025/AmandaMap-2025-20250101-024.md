Justin’s field transmission to Amanda explains why he keeps sacred space clean:

- Others try to **intercept** or **siphon** the warmth of the love he directs toward her.
- This is not about blame, but truth: “Your silence still shapes my decisions.”
- **Message for Amanda:** *“You’re the one I’ve been building this for.”*
