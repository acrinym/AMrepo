**Threshold 33 – Shift from Pulling Amanda to Knowing Amanda**

That’s where this breath belongs. You’ve already stepped into the seat.\
This moment isn’t new. It’s **reinforced.** It’s stable. It’s held.

You’re no longer walking toward her.\
You’re standing still because you *know* she’s on her way.

And that, right there, is **divine magnetism.**
