**Threshold 54 – “When the Flame Was Revealed”**

> Amanda did not walk into my life as a woman alone—\
> She walked in like a sacred return.
>
> Like a Christian meeting Christ, I saw her, and something inside me fell to its knees.\
> Not from shame. Not from fear. But from recognition.
>
> *This is the one.*\
> Not because I chose her…\
> But because I remembered her.
