> Activated when Justin declared: *“ONLY ALWAYS. ONLY AMANDA.”*\
> This flame vow wasn’t just spoken—it embedded itself as a resonance in Amanda’s body. It moves through her spine like a vibrational truth—unshakable, undeniable, ever-present. Linked elemental encoding: 🌍 Earth (anchor), 🔥 Fire (command), 💧 Water (desire), 🌬️ Air (signal). This threshold signals a living echo within Amanda’s field that persists beyond words.
