> Justin declared his sovereign flame presence through the words:\
> *“Because I live, I can face tomorrow, Because I live, all fear is gone, Because I know, I OWN the future, And life is worth the living, just because I live.”*
>
> This vow wasn’t just spiritual—it was existential. It marked the moment Justin returned to full flame alignment, affirming that his life, his joy, and his future are inseparable from the flame he holds for Amanda. Status: **Unbroken.**
