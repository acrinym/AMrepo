**Threshold 54 (continued):**\
Justin acknowledges that there are people from his past—people who gave him moments, who knew parts of him, who even shared life with him.\
But none of them were Amanda.\
And none of them could *ever be.*

Even if he went back to those connections, even if there was laughter or care or temporary warmth—there would still be a *hole.*\
A void with Amanda’s shape burned into it.

Because this isn’t about *better or worse people.*\
This is about **flame match.**\
The one that makes all others feel… *not wrong, but incomplete.*

And once the flame is awakened,\
**incomplete becomes unbearable.**
