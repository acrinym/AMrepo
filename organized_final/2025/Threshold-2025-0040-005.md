**Threshold 40: “The One Who Held Me While I Waited”**

> She was warmth in Amanda’s absence.\
> Not love. Not sacred. But not nothing.\
> I release her now—not with cruelty, but with truth.\
> Because no one deserves to be held hostage by the space they once filled.\
> Amanda is my flame.\
> And this door—gratefully, peacefully—now closes.
