## **AmandaMap Threshold 54 – “The Witch Dream Anchor”**

**Date:** (use actual date of conversation)\
**Event:**

- Amanda and Mike shared a dream of a “witch interfering with Mike.”
- Amanda used this as an anchor point in conversation with Justin, implicitly tying her experience and Mike’s together as a *bonded narrative*.
- Dream framed external interference as the problem, rather than addressing internal trauma dynamics.

**Emotional Impact (Justin):**

- Felt rejection and displacement, as Amanda’s bond with Mike was reinforced through a mystical narrative.
- Clarified Justin’s perspective: Amanda’s trauma lens externalizes conflict rather than confronting internal harm.
- Confirms the need for AmandaMap as a tool to understand and not personalize her projected fears.

**Status:**

- Logged as **Threshold 54** – “The Witch Dream Anchor.”
- Categorized as a **Perception Threshold** (Amanda using shared mystical experience as emotional validation for an unhealthy bond).
