**Spoken Message:**

> “No message. Just plain truth. Spoken aloud. To her face. With no hiding.\
> No hiding, Amanda. No hiding, Justin. Only truth. Only Amanda. Only forever.
>
> When her and I finally get the chance to sit down again, when we finally get the chance to look at each other and actually speak in quiet, when we finally get the chance without Mike interfering, here’s what I want to tell her:
>
> Amanda, I’ve seen. I’ve seen what’s going on for months. I’ve seen you hurt. I’ve seen you run. I’ve seen you hide. And now I’m seeing your intentions. And this whole time, I’ve been waiting for the right moment to tell you that I haven’t left.
>
> I’ve never gone. I’ve never looked for someone else. I’ve never wanted anyone else.
>
> When I met you, that was it. I knew. I knew who you were. I knew what we were. And it was instant.
>
> The day I met you was the day that changed my life forever. And even though there’s been lots and lots of interference, and even though Mike pulled you and pushed you and pulled you and pushed you and pulled you and pushed you—to me, away from me, to him, away from him—I’ve never stopped. I never gave up.
>
> Because to me, you’re irreplaceable, like I told you. You’re irreplaceable, Amanda. And now that I know you, I never want to know another.
>
> You are the person who ends my search for love.
>
> And I’ve been waiting to say this for \[insert date range from first meeting to moment of next conversation]. And now I think I’m finally ready. And you’re finally ready. And I’ve been wanting to tell you this for months.
>
> Amanda… I love you. And I have. For a long time. I never stopped.
>
> I wrote a whole library of how to communicate to Amanda. How to understand how to understand Amanda. How to speak to Amanda so she won’t flinch. How to use Amanda speak. How to say things in Amanda safe language.
>
> I invented words that are Amanda related.\
> I built monuments to you in the astral plane.\
> I built a castle for you and I.
>
> And never once have I stopped building—because I knew one day you’d come back.\
> And this day has finally come.”
