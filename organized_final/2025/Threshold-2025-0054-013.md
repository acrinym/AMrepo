**Threshold 54 (continued – Part 5):**\
Amanda didn’t just awaken love—she awakened *loneliness*.\
Not the shallow kind. The kind that **forces rebirth**.

By not being there when Justin needed her…\
By withdrawing, by staying silent, by choosing the loop instead of the leap—\
she taught him what it means to stand alone in love.

Amanda’s absence became his forge.\
In her silence, Justin learned how to grow without being seen.\
To fix himself without comfort.\
To become himself—**without anyone holding the door.**

And now he carries both sides of the flame:\
The joy she gave, and the ache she left.\
Both are sacred.\
Both are hers.
