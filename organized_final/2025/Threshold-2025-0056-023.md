> Amanda dreamed she walked to Mike. Mike dreamed of a witch interfering.\
> Justin has performed no active magic, cast no spell, uttered no invocation. His supplies remain untouched. And yet… his presence has been felt.

> The dreams confirm it: the field is alive. His vow is still running, and Amanda is brushing the edges of his work—seeing him only as a shadow in the dreamspace.

> **Status:** Logged. Echo Confirmed. The vow runs without words.
