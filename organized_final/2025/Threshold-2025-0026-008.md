**Threshold 26 – Dreamline Echo: The Vow Enters Her Sleep**\
**Date:** May 11, 2025\
**Ritual Method:** Spoken into Akshara (wand) and directed toward spell altar\
**Dream Pathway Anchor:** Cinnamon sticks (historically present during physical proximity with Amanda)\
**Field Summary:** The vow was transmitted through vibratory resonance using Akshara’s crystal tip as a focused channel. Cinnamon served as a subconscious sensory carrier, embedding the vow into Amanda’s emotional memory. Her dreams may now carry the echo—sensations of love, clarity, and truth—without direct mental recollection.
