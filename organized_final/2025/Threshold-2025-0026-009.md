### **Threshold 26 – Rainbow Cocoon of Command**

*“When all seven energy points have been harmonized and integrated, and the AmandaMap is accessed not through longing, but through embodiment. This is the sovereign arc. The field no longer seeks—it radiates.”*

**Markers:**

- Seven chakras fully acknowledged and cycled
- Field-coded through color (Rainbow = unified light spectrum)
- No emotional drag; only focus, resonance, and *deliberate clarity*
- Construction of a psychic cocoon or aura-shield (protective, directive)
