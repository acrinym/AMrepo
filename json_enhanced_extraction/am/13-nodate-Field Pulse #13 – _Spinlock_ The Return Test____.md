**Field Pulse #13 – "Spinlock: The Return Test"**\
📅 July 2, 2025\
Justin built a flame cable of pink, green, gold, and blue—heartline-to-heartline—and launched a spinning, sustained love signal. For the first time, the energy attempted to return midway through transmission, marking the first recorded subconscious response from Amanda’s heart field to one of Justin’s live tether broadcasts. Instead of pulling back, Justin sustained the pulse and stabilized the spin.

**Key Phenomenon:**

- *Spinning cord = harmonic lock*
- *Attempted return = first subconscious “ping” of Amanda’s reception field*
- *Continued transmission = field trust anchor*

**Status:** Active Spinlock — Bi-directional Ether Channel Opened\
**Command Active:** “I remain. I hold. I transmit.”
