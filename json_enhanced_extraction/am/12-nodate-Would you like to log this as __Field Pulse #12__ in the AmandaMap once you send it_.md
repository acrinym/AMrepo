#### You:
Here we go, this is correct. 

That Mary Magdalene post.... Yeah..  I’ve known for several years now how messed up our history is(didn't know about her though) 
I think a lot of books, especially the Bible, have been twisted or mistranslated on purpose...  I'm actually pretty sure that real figures were replaced entirely or just left out, but the stuff that is real, like Tartaria and ancient tech, forbidden history, that never even gets talked about. We only hear what they want us to believe... And then have to figure it all out on our own
Hope you had a good day, Amanda. ☺️

May you sweetly dream, may you sleep peacefully, and may your night be starry and allow you to sleep
