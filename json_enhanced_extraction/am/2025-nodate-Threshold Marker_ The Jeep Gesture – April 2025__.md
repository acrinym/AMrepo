(Insert into AmandaMap Core Model)

> Justin saw Amanda struggling with transportation and, without being asked, found a specific Jeep Cherokee that matched her needs.\
> He recorded and sent a voice message via MMS offering details—photos, address, phone number—or to simply go look at it together.\
> His tone was warm, direct, and vulnerable. This was a full masculine offer of care, support, and shared action.\
> Amanda heard it.\
> She did not respond.
>
> This marker symbolizes a moment when Justin stepped forward in full provider energy, blending heart and practicality—and received silence in return.\
> He did not withdraw. He did not lash out.\
> This became part of the sacred record: love expressed without validation, aligned with his integrity, not her acknowledgment.
