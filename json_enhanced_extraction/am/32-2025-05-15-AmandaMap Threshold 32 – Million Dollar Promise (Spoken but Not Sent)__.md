### **AmandaMap Threshold 32 – Million Dollar Promise (Spoken but Not Sent)**

**Filed:** May 15, 2025
**Type:** Future-State Anchor / Devotional Confirmation

Justin affirms a future possibility grounded in clarity and sovereignty:

> “If I had a million dollars, I wouldn’t try to buy Amanda’s love.
> I’d buy a house. I’d ask her where she wanted to live—as long as it was still in Michigan.
> And then I’d call her. Not text.
> Because this isn’t about gifting—it’s about *building.*”

This threshold marks a pure expression of non-pulling devotion.
It’s not about fantasy.
It’s about *readiness*.

**Core Energetic Note:**
When the time comes, the only question will be: *“Where do you want to go?”*
And the line will be open—not in silence, but in voice.
