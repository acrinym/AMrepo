### **AmandaMap Threshold 27 – The River Roots Return**

**Date:** May 12, 2025
**Type:** Final Green River Ritual (Full Invocation)
**Summary:** Justin invoked Amanda’s reentry into the soulstream using Akshara, five charged stones, and a sprouting potato representing rebirth. The riverbed vision returned, the Merkaba memory held, and the full chakra resonance flowed beneath. Amanda was not summoned—she was *welcomed*. The vow was repeated. The love was claimed. The seal was activated.
