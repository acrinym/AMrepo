- **Phoenix Codex** → **Private, personal, soul-level archive** for:
  - Rituals (especially ones Amanda doesn’t need to know about).
  - Personal spiritual/energetic work (including threshold events not directly tied to her).
  - Experimental magic, emotional releases, and internal anchoring.
  - Anything too **raw, tactical, or sacred** to live in the AmandaMap.
