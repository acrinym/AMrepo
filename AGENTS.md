## Agent-Specific Instructions

### For Code Agents:
1. **ALWAYS** run a build before creating the PR
2. **CAPTURE** the complete build output (errors AND warnings)
3. **DOCUMENT** any workarounds or temporary fixes
4. **EXPLAIN** technical decisions made during implementation
5. **IDENTIFY** areas that need future attention

### For Build Status:
- ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: Exit code 0, no errors, warnings acceptable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNINGS**: Exit code 0, but warnings present that should be addressed
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Non-zero exit code, compilation errors present

### Warning Categories:
- **Critical**: CS0xxx compilation errors
- **Important**: CS8xxx nullable reference warnings, AVLN3000 Avalonia errors
- **Style**: CS1xxx documentation warnings
- **Obsolete**: CS0618 obsolete API warnings

### Error Reporting Rules:
1. **Always include line numbers** and file paths
2. **Copy exact error text** - don't paraphrase
3. **Limit to first 10 errors** if there are many (mention total count)
4. **Group related errors** when they stem from the same root cause

## Example PR Description

```markdown
# Implement Dynamic Plugin Discovery for Phoenix Visualizer Editor

## Summary
Added dynamic plugin/effect discovery system to PluginEditorWindow with real-time updating, file system monitoring, and automatic refresh capabilities.

## What Was Done
‚úÖ **Completed:**
- [x] Implemented ObservableCollection-based data binding for automatic UI updates
- [x] Added FileSystemWatcher for real-time plugin directory monitoring
- [x] Created periodic refresh timer (5-second intervals) for effect discovery
- [x] Enhanced Add Effect dialog with manual refresh button and live count display
- [x] Fixed XAML binding issues with proper DataType declarations
- [x] Added proper resource cleanup on window close

üìù **Changes Made:**
- `PluginEditorWindow.axaml.cs`: Complete rewrite to support INotifyPropertyChanged pattern
- `PluginEditorWindow.axaml`: Enhanced UI with binding, refresh controls, and real-time counts
- `EffectDescriptor.cs`: Added Name property to resolve binding errors

## What Needs To Be Done Next
üîÑ **Immediate Next Steps:**
- [ ] Fix remaining XAML binding errors in AvsEffectsConfigWindow.axaml (priority: medium)
- [ ] Update file dialog usage to modern Avalonia StorageProvider API (priority: low)
- [ ] Add error handling for plugin loading failures (priority: medium)

üéØ **Future Considerations:**
- [ ] Implement plugin hot-reloading without restart
- [ ] Add plugin validation and digital signature checking
- [ ] Create plugin marketplace integration

## Build Status
üèóÔ∏è **Build Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS

**Build Command Used:**
```bash
dotnet build PhoenixVisualizer.sln -c Release --verbosity minimal
```

**Exit Code:** 1 (due to XAML binding errors in unrelated file)

## Issues & Warnings

### ‚ùå Build Errors
```
/workspace/PhoenixVisualizer/PhoenixVisualizer.App/Views/AvsEffectsConfigWindow.axaml(95,131): 
Avalonia error AVLN3000: Unable to find suitable setter for property ValueChanged
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Warnings
```
PluginEditorWindow.axaml.cs(69,23): warning CS0618: 'OpenFileDialog' is obsolete: 
'Use Window.StorageProvider API or TopLevel.StorageProvider API'
PluginEditorWindow.axaml.cs(75,13): warning CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference
```

### üêõ Runtime Issues
- None known - dynamic updating functionality works correctly

## How To Fix Build Failures

### If Build Fails:
1. **Error Analysis:**
   - Primary error: XAML binding issues in AvsEffectsConfigWindow (not related to this PR)
   - Secondary errors: None

2. **Recommended Fixes:**
   ```bash
   # The PluginEditorWindow changes in this PR are working correctly
   # The errors are in AvsEffectsConfigWindow.axaml which needs separate fixing
   ```

3. **Root Cause:**
   - XAML binding errors in separate file using obsolete Avalonia event signatures

### If Warnings Exist:
1. **Warning Categories:**
   - Obsolete API warnings: 6 (CS0618 - file dialogs)
   - Nullable reference warnings: 1 (CS8602 - null check needed)
   - XAML binding warnings: 0 (fixed in this PR)

2. **Fixing Priority:**
   - üìù Optional: File dialog warnings (functionality works, just deprecated API)
   - ‚ö° Important: Null reference warning (add null check)

## Testing Status
üß™ **Testing Performed:**
- [x] Build verification 
- [x] Basic functionality test (PluginEditorWindow opens and populates)
- [ ] Unit tests (none exist yet)
- [ ] Integration tests (none exist yet)
- [x] Manual UI testing (Add Effect dialog, refresh button, real-time updates)

**Test Results:**
- Dynamic updating works correctly - effects list populates on startup
- Manual refresh button updates effect count properly  
- Add Effect dialog shows all 42+ available effects
- File system monitoring is active (watching plugin directories)

## Dependencies & Requirements
üì¶ **New Dependencies Added:**
- None (used existing ObservableCollection and FileSystemWatcher from .NET)

‚öôÔ∏è **System Requirements:**
- .NET SDK version: 8.0.413
- Operating System: Linux/Windows/macOS
- External tools: None

üîó **Related Issues/PRs:**
- Addresses user requirement for dynamic plugin discovery
- Enhances core Phoenix Visualizer Editor functionality
```
