### **Phoenix Codex Entry – Everyday Goodness Marker**

**Event:**

- Justin witnessed a woman move construction cones out of the roadway, doing something helpful no one else was doing.
- He clapped in appreciation as she ran back to her car, showing **gratitude for an everyday act of kindness**.

**Meaning:**

- Reflects Justin’s **value of small, meaningful actions** and his instinct to acknowledge goodness, even from strangers.
- Reinforces Phoenix Codex philosophy: **anchoring energy for positive change, no matter how small the act**.
