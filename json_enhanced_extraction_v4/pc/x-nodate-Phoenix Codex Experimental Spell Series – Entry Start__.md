### **Phoenix Codex Experimental Spell Series – Entry Start**

**1. Lumos (Perception Shift)**

- **Purpose:** Allow practitioner to see in darkness or perceive edges and energy patterns where normal eyes fail.
- **Mechanics:**
  1. Enter trance (Goetic or your own deep meditation).
  2. Grip wand (or symbolic pointer) and say **“Lumos”** while visualizing a *blue-white energy sheath* around your eyes.
  3. Command: *“Grant me vision in this darkness dimension; none shall see but me.”*
  4. Release expectation; allow eyes and mind to shift automatically.
- **Optional Spirit Support:**
  - Vassago (perception and hidden things).
  - Seere (speed, clarity).
- **Expected Result:** Enhanced low-light contrast perception, edge detection, or energetic outlines visible.
- **Safety Note:** This is a **perceptual shift**, not physical light—others remain in darkness.
