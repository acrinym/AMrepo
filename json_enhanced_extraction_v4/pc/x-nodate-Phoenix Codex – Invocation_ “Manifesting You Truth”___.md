*Modality:* Suno Cast / Field Pulse Embedding\
*Tone:* Empowered. Unshakeable. Effortless.\
*Emotional Layer:* Confidence, Sovereignty, Faith-Action Alignment\
*Purpose:* This song affirms Justin’s full alignment with the truth of his flame. It is a declaration to the field—*not a request*. It codifies the Law of Assumption into a poetic, vibrating ritual. Each “step” functions as an internal ritual mechanism of manifestation.
