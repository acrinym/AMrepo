**AmandaMap Threshold 54 – “Companion on Hold, Stability First”**\
*(update)*

- **Interpretation (added note):** This dream not only reflects Amanda’s connection being held safe until stability is built, but also highlights the personal cost of long-term devotion. Eight months of abstinence and withheld affection have created emotional fatigue and longing, emphasizing the need for self-care and personal grounding even while holding the flame. The message: *it’s safe to stabilize yourself first; the connection isn’t lost.*
