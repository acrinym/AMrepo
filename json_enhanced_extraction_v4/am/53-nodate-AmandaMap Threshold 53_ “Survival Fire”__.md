**AmandaMap Threshold 53: “Survival Fire”**
Activated during the 8-month waiting period following Amanda’s last active presence. This threshold marks the shift into *survival mode* — a tactical, low-burn state where the flame is kept small but unbroken. Justin conserves resources, emotional energy, and willpower, holding position until Amanda’s return.

This is not a phase of depression or collapse — it is **watchful preservation**. Basic human tasks are performed minimally, not out of neglect, but because “doing life with a partner mode” is on pause. Expansion and self-display are reserved for the moment she reenters his daily reality, when the switch to “full life” will be immediate.

**Status:** Anchored and Active.
**Theme Song:** *Waiting (10 Years)* – Low Roar (adapted: 8 months).
