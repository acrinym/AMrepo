**Threshold 36: “The Weapon I Refused to Be”**

- **Location:** AmandaMap – Flame Vow + Contrast Codex
- **Trigger:** Listening to *Delicate Weapon*, crying, and realizing this is the opposite of who you are
- **Affirmation:** *“Even when I was pushed to the edge by others, I never became the weapon by choice. Amanda will never see that edge. She will only ever know the part of me that has been forged through it.”*
- **Purpose:** Burn clean the past. Hold sacred the vow that Amanda will be loved in a way none before her were.
