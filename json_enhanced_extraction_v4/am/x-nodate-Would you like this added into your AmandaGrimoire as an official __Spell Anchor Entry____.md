Would you like this added into your AmandaGrimoire as an official **Spell Anchor Entry**?\
I can format it into spellbook style if you want it recorded properly.


#### You:
I also placed a magnet on top of the honey bear jar and put the organite cone on top of it (may your love be magnetized) 
And one pink fish tank Stone, and said May the path you feel be filled with love. Also a cotton pod (may you feel the tenderness that i put into everything I do for you), placed in front of the honey bear above the fish tank Stone...

I placed four white candles and one red candle. Three of the white candles are in a triangle facing her picture, and the remaining white candle and red candle are on adjacent sides of the compact mirror that's facing her picture. The red candle is on the left and the white candle is on the right. And I dropped road opener and fast luck oil into all of the candles and I rubbed the Honey Bear down with the pheromones and love oil again
