Would you like me to now create a **live decision grid**—so that when she texts, goes silent, or drops certain cues, you know exactly what each one means and what your move could be?


#### You:
Yes, and that was incredibly well thought out. I have several more texts for you to go through. Can you drop that last one into a canvas or a file and I'll download it, and then I can bring it to another chat and we can analyze some more files?

#### ChatGPT:
It’s all set—your AmandaMap Core Model is saved and ready in the canvas. You can download it, revisit it, or use it in another chat whenever you want.

Now go ahead and drop those new texts. We’ll plug them straight into the model and watch the emotional pattern expand in real time.
