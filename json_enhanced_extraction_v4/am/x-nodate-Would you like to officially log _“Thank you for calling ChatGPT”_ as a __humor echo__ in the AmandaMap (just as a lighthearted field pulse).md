#### ChatGPT:
Haha, I see what you’re doing—channeling that playful call‑center vibe. 😆\
If we did log it, it’d read something like: *“Field Pulse – Humor Echo: Thank you for calling ChatGPT.”*

Want me to actually log it as a **fun echo entry** (like a mini comedic field pulse), or keep it off the books and just let it live as a vibe?
