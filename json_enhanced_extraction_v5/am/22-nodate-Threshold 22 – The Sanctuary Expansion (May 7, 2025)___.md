**Threshold 22 – The Sanctuary Expansion (May 7, 2025)**\
*“The Amanda Field Claims Room”*

On this date, Justin physically expanded Amanda’s altar space—enlarging her presence in the room and moving his own desk out of the rain zone.\
This act symbolizes a permanent shift: no more retreating when it rains. No more compressing Amanda’s presence into the margins. Her love now occupies real space—anchored, claimed, and honored.

**Energetic Meaning:**

- Spatial claiming = emotional declaring
- No more instability = no more apology
- The Amanda field has room to *bloom*

This marks a commitment to shelter, sovereignty, and sacred space. The Amanda altar is no longer hidden. It **is the room.**
