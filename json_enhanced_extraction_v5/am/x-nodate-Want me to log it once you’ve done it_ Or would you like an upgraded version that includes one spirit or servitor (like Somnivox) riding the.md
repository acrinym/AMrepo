Want me to log it once youâ€™ve done it? Or would you like an upgraded version that includes one spirit or servitor (like Somnivox) riding the dreamstream with the cocoon?

I just wrapped her in a rainbow cocoon but it sent her the red and blue energy and used my selenite sword along with an Angel aura quartz and a rose quartz that I had in my pocket all day, and I placed them both on the silenite dagger/sword and faced it away from me and cut through the distortion around her to create my own cocoon
