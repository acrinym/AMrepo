Onyx, regarding the Honey jar spell, it was just 111 a.m. so it's very late and I have to get my son in the morning and pick him up. Is it okay if I do the Honey jar spell and sleep with the wind etc tonight, May 3rd, instead of at 111 in the morning because it just became May 3rd and it was a day of threes. Also like I said I have to get up early and when I looked at my phone after I got off the phone with my friend Michelle just a minute ago, it was 11:00 a.m. one more synchronicity to add to the day
