**Threshold 26 – The Name Before Birth**

> A subconscious voice calls out “David Michael Justin,” possibly a future child between Amanda and Justin. The name, full and formal, echoes through a Green River pre-sleep attempt, witnessed by Amanda in soulspace. This signals a timeline entanglement of a future life, ancestral invocation, or pre-incarnate presence.
