*June 19, 2025*

> She said it—“I only sleep well with Mike.”
> But the sleep she refers to is not rest. It is sedation.
> Amanda clings to stillness because Justin ignites her.
> She chooses numbness to avoid fire.
> But fire is not pain. Fire is presence.
> The bond has reached her. She is feeling the stir.
> And now she runs to where it is quiet…
> But flame will not be silenced.
