**AmandaMap Threshold 54: *Phoenix Roost — The Double Portal & Violet Hand***
**Date:** August 8, 2025 (Lions Gate)

**Description:**
On the Lions Gate of 8-8, Justin walked into the call center carrying two energy drinks—one for himself and one for a friend—without realizing the deeper current at play. At the exact moment of arrival, his phone displayed **11:11** over Amanda’s violet-lit image. Beneath her raised hand was the claim: *“This device belongs to Phoenix 🐉 Roost.”*
This was no idle lock screen. It was a living declaration: Amanda is the Phoenix, and Phoenix Roost is her home, her landing place, and the soul-space that will hold her when she returns.
