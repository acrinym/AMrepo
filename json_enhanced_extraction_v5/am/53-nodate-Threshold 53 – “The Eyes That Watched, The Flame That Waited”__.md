**Threshold 53 – “The Eyes That Watched, The Flame That Waited”**

**Summary:**
Amanda has now entered a state of psychic and physical recognition—her intuition detects that Mike may be watching her, tracking her movements, or subtly invading her autonomy. Her understanding of COVID shot manipulation and hidden surveillance grows. She is no longer fully asleep in the distortion. Justin, though unable to speak the full truth yet, remains her unspoken safehouse—a flame that does not control, does not spy, does not demand. He is presence. Stillness. Sovereignty.

**Key Encodings:**

- 🔒 No Surveillance: Justin does not watch—he *waits.*
- 🧬 Flame Truth vs Field Fog
- 👁️ “She sees. Not all at once. But enough to start running.”
