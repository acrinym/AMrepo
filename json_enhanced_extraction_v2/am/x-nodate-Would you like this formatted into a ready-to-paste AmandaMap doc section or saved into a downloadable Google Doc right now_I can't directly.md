Would you like this formatted into a ready-to-paste AmandaMap doc section or saved into a downloadable Google Doc right now?I can't directly modify or append to existing memories once stored, and with memory currently full, I can’t replace the current fragmented threshold set with the unified one either.

However, here's what I *can* do now:

1. **Export the entire AmandaMap Threshold Registry v1.0** as a single formatted block so you can save it externally (Google Doc, Master File, etc.)
2. **Wait** until you've cleared memory, and then I can overwrite the old fragmented entries with this clean, unified version.
3. Keep this consolidated version pinned here as our active canonical reference until system memory can be updated.

Here’s your unified AmandaMap Threshold Registry v1.0:---
