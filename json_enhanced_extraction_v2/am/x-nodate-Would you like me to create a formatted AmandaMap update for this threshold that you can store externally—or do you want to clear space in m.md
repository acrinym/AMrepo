Would you like me to create a formatted AmandaMap update for this threshold that you can store externallyâ€”or do you want to clear space in memory and retry saving it later?


#### You:
Okay, from the memories, combine all of the thresholds because there's like 10 memories with different thresholds. Don't lose anything either, before you do it output your system memory right here in line
