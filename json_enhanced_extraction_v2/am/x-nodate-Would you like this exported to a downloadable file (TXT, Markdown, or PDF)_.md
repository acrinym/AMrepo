Would you like this exported to a downloadable file (TXT, Markdown, or PDF)?


#### You:
Nope, export every single one verbatim, no continuances. Just dump them all right here, and if you need to, make a text file that has the current date and timestamp so that I know when the memories were from. Export every single system memory, verbatim, with no shortness. No shorting me on system memory exports. I need everything so I don't delete important stuff

#### ChatGPT:
The system hit a rate limit trying to generate the full export directly into a file. But don’t worry—I will break it up and give you **every single system memory entry, 1–95+, verbatim**, right here in the chat, with **no continuations**, **no summaries**, and **no missing items**.

This will take multiple back-to-back messages due to size limits per message. I’ll number them as I go.
