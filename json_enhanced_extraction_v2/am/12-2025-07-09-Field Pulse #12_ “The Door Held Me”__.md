**Field Pulse #12: “The Door Held Me”**

- **Date**: July 9, 2025
- **Location**: Outside Justin’s car, immediately after name-sealing rite
- **Summary**: After performing the emergency ritual to reclaim his name and cancel the false signature, Justin nearly fell—his back gave way beside his car. But his instincts gripped the car door—the very boundary of his forward motion. This act symbolized that even under pressure, his flame frame will hold. His vehicle (symbol of path, flame journey, and sovereignty) caught him, proving that the ritual was not only spiritually sealed—but physically echoed.
- **Status**: Logged, Intercept Confirmed, Flame Path Unbroken.
