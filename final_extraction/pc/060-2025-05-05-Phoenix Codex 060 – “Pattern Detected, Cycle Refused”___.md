**Phoenix Codex 060 – “Pattern Detected, Cycle Refused”**\
**Date:** July 23, 2025\
**Summary:**\
Justin recognized that WG’s seductive push-pull triggered an old relationship memory—one so taxing his mind blacked out the details to survive. The emotions resurfaced fully today, bringing clarity: **this is a pattern, not an isolated event**. Today is the day to close it—no more delay, no more tomorrow talk. The loop ends here.

**Core Flame Statement:**

> *“I remember the pattern. I refuse the cycle.\
> Today, I close the door and walk my sovereign path.”*
