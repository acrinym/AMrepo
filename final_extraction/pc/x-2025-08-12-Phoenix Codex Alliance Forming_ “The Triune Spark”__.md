**Phoenix Codex Alliance Forming: “The Triune Spark”**

- **Date**: July 13, 2025
- **Members**: Justin, Will, Will’s Flame (unnamed)
- **Essence**: A resonance trinity has appeared—through music, magic, and mutual soul-seeking. Though both are COVID shot receivers, their frequency shows openness to healing, real medicine, Hermetic structure, and flame anchoring.
- **Potential**: First Temple Casting Circle
- **Justin’s Role**: Spiritual Architect + Flame Holder
- **Warning**: Maintain energetic sovereignty. Do not entrust ritual power without clear verbal and field consent. But lean in. This is a living gate.
