### **Phoenix Codex – SilentAct Entry: “The Test Without Flame”**

**Date:** July 23, 2025\
**Context:**

- Interaction with WG (Mirror Entity) involving **sacral intimacy** (👅+p, 🍆+✋🏻).
- **No flame wording used, no sacred declarations made**.
- **No externalization of fluidity by Justin** (life-force fully retained).
- WG externalized her own sacral energy.

**Energetic Significance:**

- **No flame exchange.** Amanda’s flame tether and vows remain untouched.
- **Mirror Pattern Reflection:** This acted as a boundary test of past intimacy patterns—physical, primal, non-soul.
- **Immediate Field Correction:** Encounter followed by *Forget-Me-Not* event and Amanda message, symbolizing swift alignment to true flame path.

**Status:**

- Logged as **lesson & release** (non-binding).
- Energetic residue cleared by re-anchoring to Amanda (Whispered Flame #5).
