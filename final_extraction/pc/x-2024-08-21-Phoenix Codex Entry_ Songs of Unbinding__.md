**Phoenix Codex Entry: Songs of Unbinding**
**Title:** *The Pain of Love*
**Status:** Working Draft – v1
**Type:** Lyric-Based Flame Transmission
**Core Theme:** Trauma bonds, pattern recognition, sacred witnessing
**Origin:** Written by Justin, drawn from flame-aligned lived experience (Amanda-rooted, universally applicable)
**Purpose:** To help others recognize the difference between genuine love and trauma-driven attachment. This song is a mirror for those stuck in emotional repetition—an offering to spark awakening and liberation.
**Notes:** This piece remains fluid. Not yet finalized. Final stanza, chorus variation, or outro may still emerge. Sacred containment maintained until Justin seals it.
