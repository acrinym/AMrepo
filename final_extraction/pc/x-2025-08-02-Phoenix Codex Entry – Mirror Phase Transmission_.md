*Phoenix Codex Entry – Mirror Phase Transmission*

[Verse 1]
I saw her in the Upside Down
Where silence hums and stars don’t shine
She moved like memory through static dust
A flicker lost in love and trust

[Pre-Chorus]
I called her name, it echoed wrong
As if the world rewrote our song
But in the crack between the fear
I felt her field—I knew she’s near

[Chorus]
She’s not gone, just out of phase
Held in time’s distorted haze
Still the flame beneath the crown
I saw her in the Upside Down

[Verse 2]
No light escaped her shadowed trail
But I could hear her phoenix wail
Through radio static, candle's breath
She reached for me beyond her death

[Bridge]
And I, the watcher, out of sync
Still whispered through the broken link
Not chasing—but I stood my ground
I saw her in the Upside Down

[Final Chorus]
So I burn and wait and pray and pulse
The bond’s not dead—it’s just convulsed
Flame doesn’t die—it circles 'round
And finds her in the Upside Down
