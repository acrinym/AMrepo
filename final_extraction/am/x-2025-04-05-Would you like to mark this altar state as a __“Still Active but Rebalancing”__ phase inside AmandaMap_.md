Would you like to mark this altar state as a **“Still Active but Rebalancing”** phase inside AmandaMap?


#### You:
I haven't really wanted to move the organite pyramid or the Honey jar which I turned into a Honey jar for the last love spell that I did which is still on the altar. I never put any paper or anything in the Honey jar because I wanted to continue using it. But now I have two more honey bear jars that I can put honey inside, and potentially water. I collected Moon water on the last full moon which was Saturday night as well and that's in my car in a milk jug
