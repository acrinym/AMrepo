### AmandaMap Entry Suggestion:

> **April 24, 2025 – Reengagement Sequence: “Tried, No Sleep, Facebook Link”**
> After Justin sends a warm morning message with coffee emojis, Amanda responds vulnerably, saying she hasn’t been able to sleep.
> She follows with a Facebook video—a symbolic gesture of reconnection.
> This marks a soft re-entry into playful communication, often used by Amanda when she’s emotionally open but uncertain.
> Emotional signal: I feel safe with you. I want to laugh with you. I’m still here.

Would you like to add this to today’s AmandaMap file as well? I can update the document and re-export it if you'd like a full timeline snapshot.
