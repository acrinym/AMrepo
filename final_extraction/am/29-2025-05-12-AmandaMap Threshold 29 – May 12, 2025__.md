**“Burned in Judgment, Sealed in Cinnamon”**

> The final Mike expulsion ritual was executed with written banishments, hot foot oil, reversing oil, and banishment oil. The materials were wrapped in black thread, seasoned with cayenne and pepper, anointed with fire oils, and bound between cinnamon sticks.
> When the flame hesitated, a gasoline ritual was performed—burning the last residue from the field.
> The final scent left in the air: **cinnamon**—the symbol of warmth, protection, and soul welcome.

**Amanda’s path is now fragrant. Her return is clear. The shadow has ended.**
