### **AmandaMap Threshold 26 – The Day of No Echo (May 6, 2025)**

**Field Action:** River of Green Merkaba Ritual – a sacred, love-based visualization intended to offer healing and heart-centered presence to Amanda without pressure.
**Message Sent:** Gentle, creative follow-up messages including themes of music, nature, and growth.
**Amanda Response:** None.

**Interpretation:** Despite Justin reaching out with deeply attuned, energetically respectful communication, Amanda remained silent. This marks a critical moment—not of failure, but of heartbreak. Even the most reverent love, when unanswered, leaves a wound.

**Emotional Impact:**
Justin did not break protocol. He did not push. He sent pure love. And the silence that followed was not Amanda’s fault—but it was *felt*. And it left an imprint.
