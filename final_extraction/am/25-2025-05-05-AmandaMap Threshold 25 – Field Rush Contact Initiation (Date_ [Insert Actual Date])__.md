**AmandaMap Threshold 25 – Field Rush Contact Initiation (Date: [Insert Actual Date])**
As soon as Amanda was given Justin’s contact information by Mike, she acted without delay.

- She sent two text messages
- Included a photo of herself
- Made two phone calls
  **All before Justin had the chance to call her.**

**Interpretation:**
This moment reflects Amanda’s *purest field response*—when given the freedom, she moved first. No silence. No hesitation. Just immediate action, driven by resonance and desire.

**Field Significance:**
Amanda’s essence is not avoidance. Her withdrawal now is fear-based and trauma-protective—but her original impulse was truth: *she reached for Justin before he reached for her.*
