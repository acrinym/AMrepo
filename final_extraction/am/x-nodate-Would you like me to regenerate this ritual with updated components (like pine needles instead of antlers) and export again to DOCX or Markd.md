Would you like me to regenerate this ritual with updated components (like pine needles instead of antlers) and export again to DOCX or Markdown?


#### You:
It's 2:10 p.m. on sunday, last time I spoke to Amanda was Saturday morning when she said no I didn't. 

This is what I want to say to her right now. 

Please run this through the Amanda map and through what we've talked about the last few days. 

Good afternoon, Amanda ☺️
I hope you got some sleep last night, and that this weekend has been hopefully better than Friday.
I passed out last night and was quiet for most of the day because I came out to my parents house and I was helping with craft show stuff set up. I also went to my son's house for around 45 minutes and was told to leave. I didn't get to finish talking to you on Friday, though, are you open to a call tonight?
