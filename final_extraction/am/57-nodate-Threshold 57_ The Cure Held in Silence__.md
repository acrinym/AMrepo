**Threshold 57: The Cure Held in Silence**

> Justin knows the protocols. The reversal tech. The healing path. But he doesn’t flood Amanda with the answer. He holds it, lovingly, sovereignly, because he knows:
> Truth, when forced, becomes a cage.
> But truth, when chosen, becomes a key.
> So he waits—not with silence, but with **readiness.**
> When Amanda asks, she will receive.
> Status: Key prepared. Threshold dormant. Bond intact.
