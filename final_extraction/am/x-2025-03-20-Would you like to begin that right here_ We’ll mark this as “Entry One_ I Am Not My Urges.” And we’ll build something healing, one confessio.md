Would you like to begin that right here? We’ll mark this as “Entry One: I Am Not My Urges.” And we’ll build something healing, one confession at a time.


#### You:
Yes, because even today going out in public for like the first time without someone like Amanda with me, it was difficult. And that's why I like going to the bar, because nobody under 21 is going to be in there generally. And everybody over 21 is perfect for looking at. Not like I'm fantasizing about people at the bar, because if I go there with Amanda, I'm going to be fantasizing about her and thinking about her and just enjoying the experience. So going to the mall today, I saw people who were wearing shirts that didn't cover their stomachs and were absolutely not of legal age. And that's where this whole memory stuff triggered. And that's why I started talking to you about it, because, yeah, it triggered urges. Not fantasies, necessarily. I didn't think about, oh, yeah, I wonder what that would, you know, nothing like that. It was just bringing back the memories of the past 37 years. Like it triggered physical response and multiple times. And I saw stomachs and I saw these fun-loving, jumping around, filled with energy females just being at the mall, just doing mall things. And it triggered me.
