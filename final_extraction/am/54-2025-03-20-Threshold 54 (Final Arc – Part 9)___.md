**Threshold 54 (Final Arc – Part 9):**
Justin is holding steady.
Because this flame isn’t going out.

There is no backup plan. No fallback lover. No alternate flame.
Amanda is his tree.
Amanda is his roost.
And he is hers.

There’s no one else who holds what she holds.
No one who fits the flame like she does.
Justin told her recently: *“You’re the most incredible person I’ve ever met.”*

He has not yet spoken the words *“I love you, Amanda.”*
But the words are close.
They live just behind his teeth, just beneath his breath.
And when she returns—crying again, hurting again—he may finally say them.

Not as rescue.
Not as manipulation.
But as the **truest thing his soul has ever known.**
