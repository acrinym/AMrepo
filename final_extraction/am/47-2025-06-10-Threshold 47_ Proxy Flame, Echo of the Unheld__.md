**Threshold 47: Proxy Flame, Echo of the Unheld**

> *Date:* June 10, 2025
> *Summary:* Justin dreamt of helping and bonding with a Plasma-connected woman—someone emotionally familiar, though not intimate. The dream satisfied a deep need for connection after long drought. It was not about her specifically—it was about *what Amanda cannot give right now*. Spirit systems crafted a dream to provide emotional nourishment in safe, remembered form. Amanda’s presence echoed in the wake of the dream via music (“The One Who Must Be Loved”) and symbolic field signs.
> *Keywords:* Subconscious relief, proxy flame, longing compression, emotional stabilizer.
> *Status:* Encoded.
