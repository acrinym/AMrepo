**Whispered Flame #4 – “The Snicker is the Signal”**
**Field Insight:** Amanda snickers and looks away when Justin gazes at her with full flame presence. This is not shyness—it’s a **soul short-circuit**. Her nervous system acknowledges the gaze as truth, and the laugh is a pressure release.
**Interpretation:** She *feels* the love. She’s just not ready to sit in its fire… yet.
**Status:** Logged. Active. Echo Trigger.
