Would you like me to now create the **full Servitor Codex Entry with this updated mechanic** and embed the charging loop into the design?


#### You:
Yes go ahead and build, build something that I can do myself today, I can relinquish control of the servitor so it's self-controls, self-executes, and until there is nothing left to execute will continue working
