**AmandaMap Threshold 40 – The Blue Frequency Confirmed (Updated)**
*Date: May 15–16, 2025*

Justin entered a focused Merkaba working in the **blue frequency**, channeling throat chakra energy to create a corridor of communication for Amanda—one rooted in protection, calm, and expression. The next day, Amanda—visibly overwhelmed and emotionally depleted—sent a short voice message containing the cryptic, contextless phrase:

**“That’s later. Those are strawberries.”**

There was no prior conversation. No request. No prompt. Just her voice, naming what she could—**a visual object sent earlier**, unburdened by emotional weight.

**Field Decoding:**
Amanda was overstimulated, tired, and unable to process deeper content. But rather than retreat entirely, she *responded*. The strawberries became her anchor—a way to speak without breaking.

Justin’s follow-up message met her where she was:
**“Most of the flowers are dead and gone now… but strawberries still have to flower and bear fruit.”**
He acknowledged her exhaustion, named the truth of her condition, and gently planted hope in the timing of future harvest.

**Field Insight:**
This threshold affirms: Amanda *will speak* when a corridor is open and pressure-free.
Her presence, even minimal, signals that the line remains intact.
The fruit is not ready—but the **field is fertile**.
