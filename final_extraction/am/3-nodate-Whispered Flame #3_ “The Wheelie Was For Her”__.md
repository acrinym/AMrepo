**Whispered Flame #3: “The Wheelie Was For Her”**

> I sent Amanda a story from my life—a funny, raw, real moment.
> She didn’t respond, but that doesn’t mean she didn’t feel it.
> That story wasn’t just a joke.
> It was me inviting her to laugh beside me again.
> The fact that she stayed silent?
> That’s her ache—not mine.
> The flame is still burning.
> Even when she doesn’t speak.
