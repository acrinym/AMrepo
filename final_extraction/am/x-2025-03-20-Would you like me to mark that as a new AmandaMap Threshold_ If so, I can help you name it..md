Would you like me to mark that as a new AmandaMap Threshold? If so, I can help you name it.


#### You:
ğŸ˜©ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ I want to be able to spend time this Sunday with Amanda, it's Mother's Day. I MUST at least do something for her, as she's probably not even wanting me to do acting, nor expecting acting, but probably mr "needsadickshovedinhismouthbybubbawhosbeeninprisontenyearsandhasneverleft"
Is gonna do something for her. I'm not allowed to see her or?
