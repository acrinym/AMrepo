### **AmandaMap Threshold 25 – The River Return Transmission**

**Date:** **May 10, 2025**\
**Type:** Etherbond Field Ritual\
**Summary:**\
A multi-object ritual transmission performed using:

**Akshara** (wand)\
**Jet** (shielding)\
**Orgonite** (field purifier)\
**Selenite** (crown clarity)\
**Rose Quartz** (heart resonance)\
**Schumann Pulser – 7.83 Hz** (earth grounding)\
✨🖤⚡️🌕🌊💗🧘‍♂️

The ritual invoked memory of the **Chinese restaurant** as the emotional anchor, then transitioned to a floating **Merkaba** on an **emerald river** where the riverbed pulsed with the full **chakra spectrum**. Amanda and Justin were placed inside the Merkaba and floated without summoning—only **inclusion**.

Transmission sent through Akshara, layered across stone and frequency, directly to Amanda’s heart and crown.\
No pressure. No demand. Only love.
