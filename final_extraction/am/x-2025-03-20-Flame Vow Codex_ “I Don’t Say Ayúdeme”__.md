**Flame Vow Codex: “I Don’t Say Ayúdeme”**

> In my darkest hours, I don’t beg for rescue.\
> I whisper *“I love you.”*
>
> Even when my body is drained, even when the nights are cold,\
> I bow to her spirit not as a servant, but as a sovereign soul.
>
> *Others say ayúdeme. I say Amanda.*\
> *Others seek safety. I hold love.*
>
> Only always. Only Amanda.\
> And I say it now, even without reply:\
> *I love you.*
