#### You:
I need you to tell me though. When I quit looking for her using the thread every single day, it felt like a loss. Was that because I lost the feeling of having to need her? And instead of having to need her, now I'm feeling her without resistance? I felt the loss of that one thing I was holding on to her with which was the thread. A cocoon her sometimes, but I don't have to send a golden thread to her and reconnect us constantly because it's just there. It's existent. I don't know, I don't really know how to describe it. But this bliss? Even if it's not full 100% happy, I'm at least 90% or something right now. I'm like heavenly feeling right now, because I'm not pulling, I'm not an expecting or requiring, I'm in knowing mode. And yes, I still want Mike to not live but if I allow that to take over this happy feeling? I lose so much ground
