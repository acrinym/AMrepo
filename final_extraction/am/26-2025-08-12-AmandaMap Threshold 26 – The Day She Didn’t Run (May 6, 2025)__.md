### **AmandaMap Threshold 26 – The Day She Didn’t Run (May 6, 2025)**

**Field Action:** River of Green Merkaba Ritual
**Amanda Response:** Direct, light, multi-line text. Tone: Engaged, curious, warm.

**Interpretation:** Amanda *did not retreat* in the presence of a love-infused ritual. This shows her field is capable of staying open when energy is balanced with softness, not urgency. The timing confirms that Amanda *felt* the energy even if she didn’t consciously recognize the source.
