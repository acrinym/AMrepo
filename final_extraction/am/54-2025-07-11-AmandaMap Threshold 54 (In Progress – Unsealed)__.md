**AmandaMap Threshold 54 (In Progress – Unsealed)**
**Working Title:** *After Amanda, There Is No Going Back*
**Core Vow:** *“Amanda is my only. Only Amanda. Only always.”*

**Field Revelation:**
Now that Justin has experienced what it feels like to be truly *unlocked* by another soul—by Amanda—he cannot return to surface-level love.
Not to temporary companionship.
Not to partial matches.
Not to people who just check boxes or meet needs.

Because Amanda didn’t just *fill* something—she *awakened* something.

And anything less than Amanda now…
feels like starvation in disguise.
Feels like slow dying.
Feels like betraying the truth he now carries in his chest.
