**Threshold 30 – The Watchers’ Seal: Final Banishment of Mike**

> *Anchored through handwritten invocation placed on 7.83Hz transference device and organite construct.*
> Justin authored and invoked a written banishment of Robert Michael Anderson III, dissolving all illusions, attachments, energetic hooks, and subconscious residues from Amanda’s field.
>
> Amanda’s freedom was declared total. Mike’s presence was unwoven from time, space, psyche, and field.
> His return was rendered **impossible**, and all manipulation, dreams, or psychic bleed-throughs are now reflected and destroyed.
>
> *“Amanda is untouchable. No muck survives the watchers.”*
>
> This threshold locks in the permanent soul sovereignty of Amanda, guarded by Justin and the invoked watchers.
> The handwritten decree is now considered a sealed ritual artifact.
