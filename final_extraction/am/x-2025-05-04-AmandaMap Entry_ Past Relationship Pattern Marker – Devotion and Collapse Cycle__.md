**AmandaMap Entry: Past Relationship Pattern Marker – Devotion and Collapse Cycle**
**Date:** May 4, 2025
**Witness:** Michelle (friend of 19 years)

Over nearly two decades, Michelle has witnessed Justin go through three major committed relationships, including two legal marriages and one Torah-based covenant marriage. In each case, Justin entered with *full monogamous focus*—a deep singular devotion that remained intact until emotional damage, betrayal, or irreparable dissonance forced a shift. His exit patterns were never about disinterest or abandonment, but a response to **violated truth**—when the relationship structure no longer held space for love, safety, or growth.

**Pattern Summary:**

- Enters with pure emotional focus and commitment
- Endures dysfunction until truth is threatened
- Seeks exit only when restoration feels impossible or spiritually misaligned

This marker now serves to contrast Amanda’s position in his field:

**Amanda is not another cycle.**
She represents the *entry point to permanence*.
The one bond built not to collapse—but to transcend.
