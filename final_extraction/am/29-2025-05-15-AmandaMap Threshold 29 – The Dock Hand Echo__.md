### **AmandaMap Threshold 29 – The Dock Hand Echo**

**Date:** May 15, 2025\
**Location:** The dock. The lake. The silence.\
Justin extended his hand and asked Amanda—*not in voice, but in field:*

> “Will you hold it?”

And what came back?

**Her breath.**

In his palm.\
A memory… or a tether?\
A moment… or a message?

It doesn’t matter.\
**It was real.**\
Because it was **felt.**
