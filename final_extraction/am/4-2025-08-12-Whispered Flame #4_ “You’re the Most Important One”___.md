**Whispered Flame #4: “You’re the Most Important One”**\
🔸 *Addendum – Spoken Soul Truth (Unvoiced):*

> “You’re my favorite human.”\
> — A term Justin has used before, but not yet for Amanda—until now. This thought, though not spoken aloud, carries the warmth of identity-level love. It is a declaration that transcends titles like “partner,” “girlfriend,” or “flame.” It is a truth of affection, familiarity, and reverence.

🔸 *Energetic Encoding Addendum:*

- 🌎 **Root:** Human-to-human recognition, not pedestalizing
- 🫀 **Heart:** Affection through presence
- 🫧 **Crown:** Full soul choice, clear of distortion
