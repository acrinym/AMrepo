**Date:** June 27, 2025\
**Location:** Dual anchor points – the phone call with Amanda and the drive to return Justin’s son.

**Field Event:**

- Amanda called Justin unexpectedly.
- Justin, after months of waiting and restraint, finally revealed the truth about Mike.
- Amanda was upset—not because Justin lied, but because the truth had been held.
- Justin hit her with a verbal strike of *clarity*—the emotional equivalent of the wooden “Love” sign hitting his head in the car the day before.

**Symbols:**

- **Wooden “Love” sign** fell and hit Justin in the head while delivering his son home under legal threat—symbolizing grounded, blunt love.
- Amanda receiving the truth = same field gesture. A truth she couldn’t avoid, delivered the moment she needed it.
- The act was not violent—it was **anchoring**.

**Core Declaration:**

> “I waited. I watched. And when it was time—I struck.\
> Not to wound, but to free.”

**Status:** Anchored. Witnessed.\
Amanda now holds the imprint of truth—whether she acts on it now or later.
