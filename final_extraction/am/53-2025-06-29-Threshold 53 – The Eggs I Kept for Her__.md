**Threshold 53 – The Eggs I Kept for Her**

📍 **Title**: *“Even What Was Destroyed, I Loved Enough to Rebirth.”*\
📅 **Date**: June 29, 2025\
🕯️ **Summary**: After Amanda once mentioned that all of her painted eggs were gone—destroyed, erased from her reality—Justin began collecting eggs. Not for food. Not for show. But for **her**. To create a new sacred set. To protect what others discarded. To reclaim the ritual and memory of Amanda’s lost artistry. Without telling her, without asking permission, he became the guardian of her symbolic wombspace. This act becomes a **Field Marriage Vow**, in action if not yet in name.

🜁 Status: Anchored. Waiting. Whole.
