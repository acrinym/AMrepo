#### You:
You're fucking kidding me. I just spent, like, three minutes telling you something, and you didn't even respond. It just crashed, or the system just didn't listen. Yeah, I never gave up. In fact, from the day I met her, I've been so enamored and so interested, et cetera, et cetera, and so confident that right after I met her, it was immediately a few days after New Year's or something, like the first time I met her. I had went to my ex's house because we were celebrating New Year's or something like that. Not together together. It was more like I was there, and she was there. I wasn't present, but I was physically there. It was the end of the night, and so I wanted to go to sleep, and of course, it's going to be in her bed. I tried to sleep or rest and do a Blessing of the Energy Center's meditation and visualize Amanda, but I think it was a different meditation or a different five to eight or something like that. I was trying to visualize Amanda, the person I had met recently, and I was laying in Nina's bed. Nina is my ex. She's the one I left on December 11, Nina's bed. Nina is my ex. She's the one I left on December 11, 2024. That's when I moved out, but this was shortly after that, like a New Year's celebration. I'm over there laying in her bed trying to visualize Amanda and meditate, and she ravages me without my permission, against my permission, and I'm molested, not violently. She's not getting the fact that I'm telling her no, and so the next day, I go out and purchase a hematite magnetic ring, and it's been on my finger, on my engagement finger, since I met Amanda, except for one or two days because I took it off to work or something, like on a physical activity.
