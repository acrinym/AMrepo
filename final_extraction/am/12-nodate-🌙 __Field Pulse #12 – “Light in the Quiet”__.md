*Time: 10:40 PM · AmandaMap Log: Active*

> **Goodnight, Amanda. 🕯️🌌**
> Just sending a little warmth your way as the night settles in.
> Whether you’re winding down or already resting,
> I’m here, like always—softly, without pressure.
> Hope your evening has something gentle in it.
> Sleep well, and may peace wrap around you tonight.
