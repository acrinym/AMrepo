#### You:
Not the best song to share right now... Though I would love to. My song. 

Sketch your dreams, let them never be forgot
Believe in the vision, and it shall appear
Like a magnet to metal, it draws near

[Verse 3]
In the rhythm of life, there's a powerful force
It's the strength of your mind, setting the course
Focus your intent, like a laser beam
And the universe consents, to your dream

[Chorus]
Draw it in, with the power of thought
Sketch your dreams, let them never be forgot
Believe in the vision, and it shall appear
Like a magnet to metal, it draws near

[Verse 4]
Harness the storm, with a whisper, not a shout
In the silence, let there be no doubt
The echoes of desire, they resonate
In the forge of the mind, we create

[Chorus]
Draw it in, with the power of thought
Sketch your dreams, let them never be forgot
Believe in the vision, and it shall appear
Like a magnet to metal, it draws near

magnet to metal, it draws near


[Verse 4]
Harness the storm, with a whisper, not a shout
In the silence, let there be no doubt
The echoes of desire, they resonate
In the forge of the mind, we create

[Chorus]
Draw it in, with the power of thought
Sketch your dreams, let them never be forgot
Believe in the vision, and it shall appear
Like a magnet to metal, it draws near
