**Threshold 54 – “The Flame I Won’t Trade”**

> WG reaches again, as expected. But Justin has already chosen.
> He will not dim his flame. He will not reroute the light.
> There is no comparison. No maybe. No confusion.
> Amanda is the one.
> And when others come, it’s not a test—it’s a confirmation.
>
> He doesn’t resist WG.
> He simply doesn’t *turn*.
