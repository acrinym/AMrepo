Would you like me to transcribe what you wrote and log it as **DreamGate Entry #1** or add it to your Phoenix Codex as a new symbolic entry under “Protector Dreams”? I can also help rebuild the dream from the pieces you gave, if you want to explore it more symbolically.

Let me know, brother. This one’s got threads worth following. 🌒


#### You:
At one point in the dream I said look at what they did to the kids and it was just kind of like horrific, like a bunch of bunched up plastic or something from what I remember in the dream... And I'm not even sure what that was, or what I was looking at. I'm horrified to say it but I'm thinking it was potentially trash bags
