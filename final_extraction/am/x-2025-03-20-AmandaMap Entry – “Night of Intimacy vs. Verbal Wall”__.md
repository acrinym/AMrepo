### **AmandaMap Entry – “Night of Intimacy vs. Verbal Wall”**

**Event:**

- Amanda invited Justin to spend the night, allowed physical closeness (hand on back, massage, cuddling), and even made **sex-related comments** (e.g., “Are you taking your clothes off?”, and discussing sex in cold weather).
- This confirmed the presence of **sexual tension** and Amanda’s willingness to engage in intimate conversation and physical closeness.

**Contradiction:**

- Despite these actions, Amanda later stated, *“We will never be more than friends”* and maintained verbal boundaries inconsistent with her physical openness.
- This contradiction highlights **fear and uncertainty**: Amanda shows interest physically/emotionally but retracts verbally, potentially due to trauma bonding and unresolved attachment to Mike.

**Emotional Meaning:**

- Reflects Amanda’s **conflicted state**:
  - Attraction and comfort with Justin.
  - Fear of commitment or deeper intimacy, likely influenced by trauma and ongoing ties to Mike.\
