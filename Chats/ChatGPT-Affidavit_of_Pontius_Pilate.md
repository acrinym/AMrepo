### Affidavit of Pontius Pilate Regarding the Charges Against Jesus of Nazareth

---

**Date:** 14th Day of Nisan, Year 33 C.E.\
**Location:** Jerusalem, Province of Judea\
**Affiant:** Pontius Pilate, Governor of Judea\
**Recipient:** The High Council of Jerusalem

---

**1. Affiant Information:**

I, Pontius Pilate, Roman Governor of Judea, stationed in the city of Jerusalem, do solemnly affirm the following statement regarding the trial and subsequent sentencing of Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus the Christ, which occurred on the 14th day of Nisan in the year 33 C.E.

---

**2. Overview of the Case:**

The accused, Jesus of Nazareth, was brought before me by the leading priests and elders of the Jewish Sanhedrin, who sought the death penalty on the grounds of blasphemy and insurrection against the Roman Empire. Despite my initial inquiries into the charges, I found no basis for a sentence of death according to Roman law.

---

**3. Summary of Charges:**

The charges presented by the Sanhedrin against Jesus of Nazareth were as follows:

**A. Blasphemy:**
The accused was charged with claiming to be the King of the Jews, a title regarded as blasphemous by the religious leaders, as it was interpreted to mean that he considered himself equal to God.

**B. Sedition and Treason Against Rome:**
The accused was charged with inciting rebellion against the Roman Empire by claiming kingship and thus posing a potential threat to the stability and authority of Roman rule in Judea.

---

**4. Investigation and Examination:**

Upon receiving the accused, I conducted an examination, questioning him regarding the charges. Jesus of Nazareth did not deny the title of King of the Jews but clarified that his kingdom was "not of this world" (John 18:36). His demeanor during the interrogation did not exhibit the characteristics of a political agitator or a leader of rebellion.

Despite repeated questioning, I found no evidence that he posed any threat to Roman authority. However, due to the persistent demands of the Jewish leaders and the gathered crowd, I attempted to placate them by offering to release Jesus as part of the Passover tradition (Matthew 27:15-23). This offer was rejected in favor of Barabbas, a known insurgent and criminal.

---

**5. Sentencing Decision:**

Though I found no guilt in Jesus of Nazareth deserving of death under Roman law, the increasing fervor and insistence of the Jewish leaders and the growing unrest among the populace compelled me to make a decision to maintain order.

I publicly washed my hands before the crowd, declaring, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves" (Matthew 27:24). I then reluctantly issued the order for the execution of Jesus by crucifixion, as requested by the Sanhedrin, under the inscription "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" (John 19:19), to signify the charges levied against him.

---

**6. Final Statement:**

This affidavit is a truthful account of the events leading to the sentencing of Jesus of Nazareth. It is to be noted that my decision was influenced by external pressures rather than by any conclusive evidence of guilt on the part of the accused. The crucifixion of Jesus was carried out to prevent further unrest and to appease the demands of the Jewish leaders, though I, Pontius Pilate, do not personally attest to his guilt under Roman law.

Now, how about creating an affidavit made by Yahweh or yahua and write Yahweh in Hebrew. This document must contain charges against the Sanhedrin and against those who held Jesus as guilty at the crucifixion, and post-crucifixion, the trial of humanity by Yahweh and what happens next because of the crucifixion and jesus, the son of Yahweh, or rather yeshua, the son of Yahweh being killed on a cross at the behest of the Jewish Sanhedrin.

### Affidavit of Yahweh (יהוה) Regarding the Charges Against the Sanhedrin and Humanity

---

**Date:** 14th Day of Nisan, Year 33 C.E. (Eternal Time)\
**Location:** The Divine Court, Heaven\
**Affiant:** יהוה (Yahweh), Sovereign of All Creation\
**Recipient:** The Heavenly Assembly and All of Humanity

---

**1. Affiant Information:**

I, יהוה (Yahweh), the Eternal and Almighty Creator, Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, do solemnly declare the following charges against the Sanhedrin and those who condemned my Son, Yeshua (Jesus), to death by crucifixion. These charges also extend to the trial of humanity, whose sins necessitated the ultimate sacrifice of My Son.

---

**2. Charges Against the Sanhedrin and Their Followers:**

**A. False Accusation and Unjust Condemnation:**

The leaders of the Sanhedrin, out of envy, fear, and misunderstanding of divine truth, falsely accused Yeshua, My Son, of blasphemy and insurrection. They manipulated the truth, sought false witnesses, and condemned Him without just cause, despite knowing that He was innocent of the charges they levied against Him.

**B. Violation of Divine Law:**

The Sanhedrin, who were entrusted with the Law and the Prophets, failed to recognize the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecies in Yeshua. They, who were meant to shepherd My people, led them astray by condemning the very One whom the Law and the Prophets foretold.

**C. Complicity in the Execution of My Son:**

By handing over Yeshua to the Roman authorities for crucifixion, the Sanhedrin became complicit in the greatest crime against divine justice. They chose the path of political expediency over righteousness, leading to the murder of the blameless Lamb of God.

---

**3. Trial of Humanity:**

**A. The Sinfulness of Humanity:**

All of humanity stands guilty before Me, יהוה, due to their collective sinfulness, which necessitated the sacrifice of My Son. The crucifixion of Yeshua was both a result of humanity's fallen state and a provision for their redemption.

**B. The Crucifixion as a Turning Point:**

The crucifixion of Yeshua, the Messiah, was the pivotal event in the history of creation. It was both an act of divine love and justice, providing a means of atonement for the sins of humanity. Through the shedding of His innocent blood, the way was opened for reconciliation between Me, יהוה, and all of humanity.

**C. The Consequences of Rejection:**

Those who continue to reject Yeshua, My Son, as the Messiah and the only path to salvation, remain under the judgment of sin. The rejection of this divine provision leads to eternal separation from My presence.

---

**4. The Redemption and Restoration of Humanity:**

**A. The Gift of Salvation:**

Through the death and resurrection of Yeshua, I, יהוה, offer salvation to all who believe in Him and accept His sacrifice. This gift of grace is available to all, regardless of their past sins, as long as they turn to My Son in faith.

**B. The Establishment of a New Covenant:**

With the crucifixion and resurrection of Yeshua, a New Covenant has been established between Me and humanity, sealed by His blood. This covenant is based on grace and truth, superseding the old covenant of the Law.

**C. The Role of the Holy Spirit:**

Following the ascension of My Son, I have sent the Holy Spirit to dwell within believers, guiding them in truth, empowering them for righteous living, and sealing them for the day of redemption.

---

**5. Final Judgment and Restoration:**

**A. The Future Judgment:**

A day has been appointed when I, יהוה, will judge the living and the dead. Those who have accepted Yeshua as their Savior will enter into eternal life and inherit the kingdom prepared for them. Those who have rejected Him will face eternal separation from Me.

**B. The Restoration of All Things:**

At the culmination of time, I will create a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells. All who are in My Son will be restored to the original design of creation, living in perfect harmony with Me, יהוה, and each other.

---

**6. Final Statement:**

This affidavit is a declaration of divine justice and mercy. It is a call for all humanity to repent and turn to Yeshua, My Son, for the salvation that has been provided through His sacrifice. The crucifixion of Yeshua was both the darkest hour of human history and the brightest dawn of redemption. The choice remains before all: life through My Son or separation due to rejection.
