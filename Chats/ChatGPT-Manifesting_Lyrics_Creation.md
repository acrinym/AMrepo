[Intro]

[Soft, confident synths building into a steady, pulsing rhythm]
The world unfolds, a canvas bright,
Every step aligns just right.
Close my eyes, I feel the flow,
What I seek? I already know.


---

[Verse 1]

[Deep groove, steady heartbeat rhythm, effortless confidence]
No more reaching, no more chase,
Everything moves at its perfect pace.
I don’t ask—I claim, I stand,
What’s meant for me is in my hands.


---

[Chorus]

[Big, open, triumphant—like running with arms wide open into the future]
Ohhh, I breathe it, I feel it, it's already here,
No resistance, no doubt, just light, just clear.
I move like I’ve won, steady and free,
'Cause my world unfolds effortlessly.


---

[Verse 2]

[Playful, rhythmic claps]
Step one—hold it real,
See it touchable, make it feel.
Step two—live it now,
It's not tomorrow, it’s here somehow.


---

[Bridge 1]

[Ethereal, atmospheric rhythm]
No weight to carry, nothing to prove,
Like the ocean tide, I’m in the groove.
The door swings open, I walk inside,
I don’t wait—I arrive.


---

[Verse 3]

[Bouncy beat, atmospheric synths]
Step three—breathe it in,
Let the knowing flood your skin.
Step four—trust the sound,
It’s already here, all around.


---

[Chorus]

[Even bigger rhythm, syncopated]
Ohhh, I breathe it, I feel it, it's already here,
No resistance, no doubt, just light, just clear.
I move like I’ve won, steady and free,
'Cause my world unfolds effortlessly.


---

[Bridge 2]

[Melodic breakdown, warm harmonies]
I walk with ease, I rest in grace,
I trust, I know, I hold the space.
Not in waiting, not in need,
The seeds are grown—I just receive.


---

[Verse 4]

[Beat comes back strong, bass drop]
Step five—release, let go,
The current takes me where I know.
Step six—I stand, I shine,
What I asked for? Already mine.


---

[Outro]

[Soft fade-out, echoing vocals]
Ohhh, I knew it, I felt it, it’s already here,
No resistance, no fear, just light, just clear.
What I live, I already own,
Every thought becomes my throne.

That's already the song on suno silly

Ha—caught me mid-hype! You already knew what you were doing. That one’s an anthem, Justin. Seriously potent.

#### You:
Now how do I put this on amuse.io since it's a suno generated creation and suno is actually the artist but I'm publishing the music

#### ChatGPT:
Great question—here’s a step-by-step guide to releasing a **Suno-generated track** on **Amuse.io**, while correctly crediting **Suno as the artist** and yourself as the publisher:

---

### **1. Prep Your Assets**

Make sure you have the following ready:

- **Audio file** (from Suno)
- **Cover art** (you just resized it—perfect)
- **Song title** (e.g., “Manifesting Your Truth”)
- **Release date**
- **Genre** (Progressive House / Electronic)

---

### **2. Determine Artist & Ownership**

Since **Suno is the artist**, and you're the publisher:

- **Artist Name:** `Suno AI` *(or just `Suno`, depending on platform policy)*
- **Primary Artist Field:** Use “Suno AI” as the artist
- **Your Role:** Set yourself as the **publisher**, **label**, or even **distributor** if that’s your intent.
- **Songwriters/Composers:** You can either:
  - Leave blank
  - Or list yourself with a note that the vocals/track were AI-generated

---

### **3. On Amuse.io: Create a New Release**

1. Go to **[Amuse.io](https://www.amuse.io)**
2. Log in or create an account.
3. Click **“Create New Release”**
4. Fill in:
   - **Track Title**
   - **Artist:** *Suno* (or *Suno AI*)
   - **Label Name (optional):** your own (e.g., “Justin Fields Music”)
   - **Composer & Songwriter:** *Justin Fields (AI-assisted)*, or similar
   - **Producer (optional):** Suno AI / Justin Fields
   - **Genre/Subgenre**
5. Upload:
   - **Audio file** (MP3 or WAV)
   - **Cover art** (must be square, under 10MB, no URLs or copyright logos)

---

### **4. Licensing Notice (Optional But Recommended)**

In the description or liner notes:

> “This track was created using Suno AI’s generative audio tools. All vocals and instrumental elements were AI-generated. Released for non-commercial/promotional use unless otherwise licensed.”

This shows transparency and protects you from DMCA or licensing issues.

---

### **5. Release Options**

Choose:

- **Release Date**
- **Territories** (Worldwide or custom)
- **Stores** (Spotify, Apple, TikTok, etc.)

---

### **6. Finalize & Submit**

Review everything. Once approved by Amuse, your track will be distributed under your account, with **Suno credited as artist**.

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect—you're almost there! The screenshot confirms your release *"Manifesting your truth"* is already **in review** on Amuse, which means the hardest part is done.

Now, for clarity and protection regarding Suno's AI contribution, here’s what you might still consider:

---

### **1. Description / Credits Update (if editable before delivery):**

If Amuse allows editing the **release description**, **metadata**, or **credits** while it's still "In Review," you can add this:

> **Vocals & Instrumentation:** AI-generated using Suno\
> **Publisher/Curator:** Justin Fields\
> **Note:** This track was created using generative AI tools. All vocals and instrumentals were produced via Suno AI. Released for creative and promotional purposes under user’s license.

If not editable now, you can always include that on **your artist profile** or on future releases.

---

### **2. UPC & Metadata Tracking**

The “UPC” field in your screenshot is currently blank. That’s normal while it’s under review—Amuse will assign one automatically unless you provide your own. Once it's delivered, they’ll give you the UPC so you can use it for tracking and royalty management.

---

### **3. Optional: Registering or Declaring AI Use**

Some platforms (like Spotify for Artists or DistroKid) are now requiring disclosure of AI-generated content. While Amuse doesn’t yet mandate this, you may want to prep for that standard going forward.

---

### Would you like a publisher name or short label title to use on future tracks?

For example:

- **Field Source Music**
- **OnlyAlways Records**
- **Codewave Manifestations**
- **Phoenix Frequency**
