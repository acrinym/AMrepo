# Psychological Tactics in Videos

#### You:
I've been watching a YouTuber who provides photos and talks about an alternate history view and then says things like do you really think we're going to fall for the current narrative anymore? We're all too smart for that now. We all know what you've done and we all know that the mainstream story is that correct. Also, do you really think we're so dumb that we wouldn't figure out the pattern in mainstream history ... 

And here's what I wanted to ask you... I need to know what psychological tactics are being used in that type of video

#### ChatGPT:
The psychological tactics used in such videos are carefully crafted to appeal to viewers' emotions, sense of identity, and critical thinking skills. Here are the primary tactics at play:

---

### **1. Us vs. Them Framing**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Creates a sense of belonging and camaraderie among viewers ("us") while positioning the mainstream narrative or establishment as the opposition ("them").
- **Effect:** Encourages viewers to align with the YouTuber’s perspective to feel part of an "enlightened" or "awakened" group. This boosts group identity and fosters loyalty.

---

### **2. Confirmation Bias Appeal**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** The YouTuber presents content that aligns with viewers’ pre-existing doubts or beliefs about mainstream history or narratives.
- **Effect:** Reinforces what viewers already believe, making them more likely to trust the YouTuber as a source of "truth."

---

### **3. Flattery and Intellectual Validation**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Phrases like "We're all too smart for that now" flatter viewers by implying they are intelligent and insightful for rejecting mainstream narratives.
- **Effect:** Viewers feel validated and empowered, increasing their emotional attachment to the content.

---

### **4. Implicit Authority**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** By using phrases like "We all know" or "Everyone understands now," the speaker implies consensus and authority without providing direct evidence.
- **Effect:** Viewers are less likely to question the content because it seems backed by an invisible majority or expert consensus.

---

### **5. Open-Ended Questioning**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Rhetorical questions like "Do you really think we wouldn’t figure this out?" challenge viewers to internally agree with the premise.
- **Effect:** These questions lead viewers to conclude they *should* agree because the alternative would imply they are naive or uninformed.

---

### **6. Emotional Triggering**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Statements like "We all know what you’ve done" evoke anger, betrayal, or indignation toward the establishment or mainstream.
- **Effect:** These emotions make viewers more engaged and likely to adopt the YouTuber’s perspective.

---

### **7. Pattern Recognition Appeal**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Highlighting "patterns" in mainstream history exploits the brain’s natural tendency to find meaning and coherence in information.
- **Effect:** Viewers feel a sense of discovery and empowerment, as though they’ve uncovered hidden truths.

---

### **8. Tribal Language and Community Building**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** The use of inclusive language like "we" and "us" fosters a sense of belonging to a larger movement.
- **Effect:** Encourages viewers to share the content, further reinforcing their identification with the group.

---

### **9. Implicit Call to Action**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Statements like "We’re not falling for it anymore" imply viewers should reject mainstream narratives and align with alternative viewpoints.
- **Effect:** Viewers feel motivated to act or share the content, spreading the YouTuber’s ideas.

---

### **10. Authority Discrediting**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Undermining mainstream narratives by suggesting they are deceptive or intentionally misleading.
- **Effect:** Viewers become more skeptical of traditional sources of information, reinforcing their trust in the YouTuber.

---

### **11. Use of Visuals and Anecdotes**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Showing compelling photos or anecdotes while discussing suppressed histories taps into sensory and emotional engagement.
- **Effect:** The narrative becomes more vivid and persuasive, as the visuals evoke curiosity and confirmation of the claims.

---

### **12. Cognitive Dissonance Exploitation**

- **Psychological Mechanism:** Viewers who are already skeptical of mainstream narratives feel internal tension if they don't agree with the YouTuber’s perspective.
- **Effect:** To resolve this dissonance, viewers are more likely to adopt the alternative narrative presented.

---

### Conclusion:

The combination of these tactics creates a potent psychological pull. It flatters the viewer’s intelligence, builds a sense of community, and leverages emotional and cognitive triggers to make the alternative history viewpoint not just compelling, but also deeply personal.
