Based on this document and this supreme Court case, isn't CPS et Al no Android is a non de jure government body

#### ChatGPT:
The document you've shared, *Norton v. Shelby County*, is indeed a Supreme Court case that deals with the concept of "de jure" (lawful) and "de facto" (in practice) government authority. This case established that any acts performed by government bodies that lack proper legal authority ("non de jure") are considered void and have no legal standing. Specifically, it held that "an unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed."

This ruling can be relevant when considering agencies like Child Protective Services (CPS). CPS functions under state laws but does not derive its authority from the federal Constitution, leading some to question its "de jure" legitimacy, particularly if one argues that it oversteps constitutional rights or state laws. However, CPS is generally considered a "de facto" agency; it operates under state and local governments’ authority in practice, though it's often criticized regarding oversight and constitutional boundaries.

If your argument is that CPS operates without de jure authority similar to the reasoning in *Norton v. Shelby County*, it would be necessary to demonstrate that CPS (or similar agencies) acts outside constitutional or legally mandated authority—essentially functioning outside the bounds of law in a way that would render its actions void.The document you've shared, *Norton v.
