Another option is [**AIVA**](https://www.aiva.ai/), which is an AI-based tool that can analyze and even compose music. While it's more focused on composition, it does have some capabilities for analyzing and understanding the style and genre of music based on the input you provide.

Finally, [**AcousticBrainz**](https://acousticbrainz.org/) is a project by MetaBrainz that offers detailed analyses of songs, including genre classifications, mood, and other audio features. You can upload a song, and it will provide a detailed breakdown of various musical attributes.
