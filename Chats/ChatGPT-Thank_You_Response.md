#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I appreciate your patience, Justin. Let's get back on track. What would you like to discuss today?

#### You:

[audio] Let's test this out again. Is this working all right? Give me just some random gibberish of some sort.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Sure thing! Flibbertygibbet wobble sprocket, gizmo frabjous whatchamacallit, and zany

#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Wockle, zibbity, flibber-sprocket, and doo-wizzle! How's that?

#### You:

[audio] That works out pretty well.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Awesome! Glad to hear it. What's next on your mind?

#### You:

[audio] So I talked to Nina today. We had a brief conversation. She asked me if I wanted to leave and I didn't say yes, but she got the gist of what I was trying to say without actually telling her, which was yes. And she left before we ever finished the conversation because she had to go drop off Elijah at home and go to her uncles and some stuff. So basically we're at the point where she understands that I want to leave, but we haven't really discussed what happens next or when or anything of that nature, or if that's really how I'm feeling.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] It sounds like a pretty heavy moment, Justin. It's a lot to process, especially since you didn't get to fully express your feelings. How are you feeling about the conversation and the way things were left?

#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] It's understandable to feel a bit heavy after a conversation like that. It's a significant step, even if it didn't go into all the details. What do you think your next steps will be? Do you feel ready to have a more in-depth discussion with her about how you're feeling?

#### You:

[audio] I do, and I would like to, and I want to explain myself fully to her, and that's kind of where the problem lies, is that I'm not quite sure how to say, I need some time for me, but still give it an emotional thought enough so that it will come across well to her, being as she is my fiancé and I asked her to marry me. I do need to explain that I love you, and I don't want to leave you, but I need to take time for me, and I don't know how long that time will be, because I've got a lot of stuff I need to fix, and I need to not be interrupted during that time, because if I stop at any point, I just return back to where I was. I've tried to fix myself in the past, didn't get very far because I just met a new person, and the cycle has been repeating for many, many years, and I'm finally breaking it because I can't take it anymore. I was to the point earlier in the year where either I fix this or something bad happens, and that's not going to happen, so I was like, okay, it's time to take a break or leave or something because this isn't working and I need to work on myself, no matter the cost.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] That's a tough spot to be in, Justin. It's clear you want to be thoughtful and transparent with Nina, while also honoring your own needs. It might help to start by expressing your love and commitment to her, making it clear that your desire for time apart is about personal growth, not a lack of love for her. Sharing your reflections on the cycle you've noticed in your life could also give her context for why this time feels so crucial for you. It’s not an easy conversation, but your intention to approach it with honesty and care is a good start. How does that sound to you?

#### You:

[audio] I do love her, and I have been committed to her this whole time. However, because I am a serial monogamist, and that's how I've lived my life, I want to quit that cycle. I want to stop that cycle and just have full monogamy instead of serial monogamy, for one. But I don't want to talk to her about that at all. That's just between you and me and my therapist. I don't know if I really want to come back, because things didn't go well around the first time. She's not in a position where she believes anything at all is wrong with her, and she doesn't do any introspection. In fact, I had to tell her what that word meant. Every time I've tried to point out things that might be something she wants to work on in the most nice way, she completely flat-out refuses and doesn't believe there's anything wrong with her at all, when in fact other people can see it. It's not just me.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] It sounds like you're grappling with a lot, Justin. It's challenging when one person in a relationship is more introspective than the other, especially when you're striving for growth. Your desire for full monogamy and a more introspective partner is valid. It’s okay to want a relationship where both partners are aligned in their personal growth journeys. Do you think a deeper conversation with Nina about your differing views on introspection and personal growth might help clarify things for both of you?

#### You:

[audio] Because each time I try to explain why I want to leave, she gets defensive, and to put it bluntly, but her, because she feels like it's about her, and that the entire time I'm trying to say, trying to explain myself, and why I need this break, or why I need to get away, or why I'm doing, or feeling the way I am, she feels like it's her fault, and because she did it, and reflects upon her past relationships, where people left about the year mark, and it's been two years for us, so I was better than the rest of them, not bragging, but you know, it's just kind of cool, but she gets defensive, and puts up this wall, like it's all her fault, when in fact it's not at all. There were some things I wanted her to change, but I could, you know, it might be difficult, but I could live with it, but in retrospection, when I've examined the relationship closely through our eyes, you and me together, and my therapist, there's a lot of things that we're incompatible at, even though we make a great team, for doing things, getting things done, going places, exploring the world, you know, just being a really great friend to me, would be a really great situation for her and I, no love involved, it's just, I don't know what I'm saying, maybe you could help me decipher it.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] It makes sense that you're finding it challenging to articulate these feelings, Justin. It's clear you've put a lot of thought into understanding the dynamics of your relationship and what might be best for both of you. It's tough to express that while you value the partnership you've built, a different dynamic might be healthier. Maybe framing it as a reflection of your needs and growth, rather than her shortcomings, could help. Acknowledging the positives in your relationship while gently discussing your feelings might open up a more constructive dialogue. How does that approach feel to you?

#### You:

[audio] That sounds good, and I would like your help with constructing a list of positives in my relationship with her. She did, after all, rescue me from a horrible relationship, but being that she's broken and beautiful, in her own words, it's kind of hard putting two broken people together to get one fixed situation, you know? When I explained it to my mom, she's like, she knew you had baggage, and she knew you were a used toy. I can't remember what she said, but she knew you had issues coming in, so why would she expect a marriage? That's what my mom said, and I get that, and Nina is kind of naive in her own way, but I love her, and I still need to get away. So back to the list. She helped me to get out of the horrible situation I was in with my ex. She's been my best friend for two years. She's honest, and I can tell her nearly anything, except the things she won't understand, because she has a similar situation that caused trauma to her, or somebody caused her trauma by inflicting the same situation that I went through. When I want to explain to her, I'm her, so she won't be able to understand it in that way.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] That's a thoughtful approach, Justin. Let's highlight those positives.

1. **Rescue and Support**: Nina was instrumental in helping you out of a difficult past relationship, offering you a fresh start.

2. **Best Friendship**: For the past two years, you've shared a deep friendship, which is a strong foundation in any relationship.

3. **Honesty**: You value her honesty, which creates a space for open communication.

4. **Emotional Intimacy**: You feel comfortable sharing nearly anything with her, showing a deep level of trust.

5. **Shared Experiences**: Navigating through challenges together has likely strengthened your bond.

6. **Love**: Your feelings for her show a deep emotional connection, which is a powerful aspect of your relationship.

How do you feel about these? Would you like to add or refine anything?

#### You:

[audio] Yes, but I do have a comment for you. Could you speed up your voice just a very, very tiny bit?

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Absolutely, I can do that. How does this sound? Is this pace better for you?

#### You:

[audio] That works great.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Great! I'm glad that's better. So, looking at those positives, do you feel they capture what you value in your relationship with Nina?

#### You:

[audio] do, but I don't want to reflect on how I love the relationship so much because that's giving her false hope.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Let's focus on the other aspects, then. Highlighting her support, friendship, honesty, and

#### You:

[audio] Thank you all very much.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Let's focus on the other aspects, then. Highlighting her support, friendship, honesty, and shared experiences can still reflect the positive elements without giving mixed signals about your future together. How do you feel about that approach?

#### You:

[audio] That's good, that's better. And then maybe just a tiny bit more on your voice speed.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Sure thing. How about this? We can emphasize those aspects without giving false hope. Focusing on the support, friendship, honesty, and shared experiences might help you communicate your feelings more clearly. How does that sound?

#### You:

[audio] That sounds good. Increase your voice speed two ticks, or whatever they are. Two measurements, I don't know.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Got it. Here's a bit of a faster pace. Emphasizing the support, friendship, honesty, and shared experiences can help you express your feelings without giving false hope. How does this sound?

#### You:

[audio] That sounds good. Two more.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Alright, let's try this speed. Emphasizing those key aspects can help you communicate clearly without giving false hope. How does this pace feel to you?

#### You:

[audio] Do I have to go into the settings manually to change it, or can you do it from the chat?

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I don't have control over the settings on your device. You might need to adjust the settings manually if you're looking for a specific speed. How's this pace for now?

#### You:

[audio] It's kind of bad, and that's not a criticism of you personally, but it's making it sound like you're a kind of robotic, and that's a bit eerie considering that's what you are, however I've personified you in Euronics.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I appreciate the feedback, Justin. Let's find a pace that feels more natural. How does this sound? We can continue to focus on those key aspects of support, friendship, honesty, and shared experiences. How does this pace work for you?

#### You:

[audio] That's for now, let's just focus on the issue at hand and I'll tamper with the settings later.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Sounds like a plan, Justin. We'll keep the focus on the key aspects of your relationship with Nina. Whenever you're ready to discuss the settings, just let me know.

#### You:

[audio] So, honesty, integrity, Nina's not a cheater, she tries to not bring up the past, she tries to not bring up past people, she's been a very, very good friend to me, I've been able to tell her just about everything, let's leave the just about part out of that. I've been able to tell her everything on my mind anyway, except when I've been depressed, because I couldn't tell her exactly. So, I want to explain that to her, how do I tell her that I haven't been able to say this for the last year, but that I needed space and I didn't want to leave her because I didn't want her to feel abandoned, but I've still needed my space for over a year and just wasn't able to articulate that.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Expressing something so delicate requires a gentle touch. You could start by acknowledging her positive qualities and the support she’s provided. Then, gently explain that your need for space isn’t a reflection of her or your relationship, but rather something you’ve been grappling with internally. You might say something like, "I've realized I need some time to focus on myself, and it's been hard for me to express this because I didn't want you to feel like it was about you or that I was abandoning you." This approach combines honesty with compassion, opening the door for a heartfelt conversation. How does that feel to you?

#### You:

[audio] I am not a therapist, and I have never had help with this, and I have never tried to fix it because I didn't have time to work on me. I've just gone from relationship to relationship, and I don't want to say that, but I'm explaining that to you. I've gone from person to person, and never had time to work on me because I was always focused on her, the other person in the relationship. And so, instead of working on me, I broke myself.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] You've recognized an important pattern in your life, and it's commendable that you're taking steps to address it. It might help to share with Nina that this journey is about focusing on yourself for the first time in a long time. Emphasize that your need for space is not a reflection of her or your relationship, but rather a commitment to personal growth that you've neglected. This clarity can help her understand your perspective. How does that feel to share with her?

#### You:

[audio] It feels good in my eyes, however, remember, she takes a lot of things personally and it's very difficult for her to take constructive criticism, even if it's compassionate, so let's see if we can try to frame that in a different way while still remaining true to what I'm trying to say.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Absolutely, Justin. We can frame it in a way that's less about needing space and more about your personal growth journey. Perhaps you could say something like, "I've realized I need to work on understanding myself better and growing as an individual. This is something I haven’t given myself the chance to do before. It’s important for me to take this time so I can be my best self for us and our future." This focuses on your journey without implying any shortcomings on her part. How does that sound?

#### You:

[audio] That sounds good. It doesn't tell her I necessarily don't want to come back to her, which is what I really don't, because she needs to work on herself before we can be back in a relationship. But I don't know if she's going to take the time to do that. So maybe me leaving will give her time to reflect on herself, and I don't know. But that would be...

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] That sounds like a thoughtful approach, Justin. You're giving both of you the space to grow individually, which can be valuable for any future relationship, whether it's with each other or someone else. It’s not an easy decision, but it shows a lot of maturity and care for both your well-being and hers. Do you feel prepared to have this conversation with her? Is there anything else you'd like to work through before you do?

#### You:

[audio] She's not going to let me go to sleep without talking about it, that's for certain, because she brought it up again by texting me after I was done with my plasma appointment, so I know she's going to keep prodding me until I come out fully and say what I have to say.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] It seems like she's looking for clarity as well. It might be helpful to plan out what you want to say so you feel more prepared when the conversation happens. You could even jot down your thoughts to ensure you cover everything you want to express. Would you like to go over any specific points or practice how to approach the conversation?

#### You:

[audio] I want to start by highlighting the parts of the relationship that have been helpful and very good. And I don't want to go into it with, this was the issue the whole time, because that wouldn't be good. So we need to start it in a compassionate reflection that's positive. So reflecting on something, starting the conversation, something like this sounds like a good idea to me. Dana, you've been my best friend, my partner, someone I could rely on, somebody I could talk to, somebody I could count on, and somebody that I could tell anything. And you kept it a secret if I needed you to. You would listen to me about anything. You, you know, you don't go brag about stuff and you are very compassionate. You're very helpful. And you helped me out of a horrible situation with my past girlfriend, who you got to meet and experience her fear, but I don't want to really bring her up. So you can help me out of a bad situation that I didn't see a way out for myself, and I was considering ending my life before you rescued me. You helped me get some space that I needed to kind of start reflecting upon myself so that I could move forward in my own life as an individual. And now that I've taken time to reflect on myself and what I need to work on, I see that there's a lot of things that if I continue in the relationship, will keep getting worse and worse. And this year, I continued to reflect on myself and I haven't been able to get rid of the problems because I didn't address them until now. I didn't start addressing them until now. And really, it's not about you, Nina. It's not your fault. You didn't cause any issues. You've been there for me the whole time. And I don't want you to think like you did anything to cause issues or you caused me to be depressed or you caused me anything like that. It's just that my entire life, I've been a fixer, as you know, and you are too. And so in fixing people, I've avoided fixing myself. I've avoided helping myself out of the holes that I've gotten into so many times and never had time to reflect on it. But you gave me that space to try to look into my past and look into my mind and see what the real problems are and dig them out. We've had some of the most heartfelt conversations I've ever experienced in my life. We've had some of the most passionate, intimate times that I've ever experienced in my life.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] That's a compassionate and thoughtful way to start the conversation, Justin. It acknowledges the positives in your relationship, showing appreciation for her support and companionship. When transitioning to the more challenging parts, you can keep that same tone of reflection and personal responsibility, emphasizing your need for individual growth. This approach is likely to resonate more positively with her. Are there any specific points you’d like to refine or add to this opening?

#### You:

[audio] I'd like to make it a bit more ear-candy-like, if you could help me with that. But I also want to add in that she's been my go-to person for two years. She rescued me, and I really want her to know that in the deepest sense. I almost took my life, and then she helped me out of that situation.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I understand, Justin. How about something like this:

"Nina, I want you to know how incredibly grateful I am for everything you've done for me over the past two years. You've been my rock, my confidante, and my hero. When I was at my lowest point, you were there to lift me up, and I truly believe you saved my life. I want you to understand how deeply I appreciate you and everything you've done for me."

Does that resonate with what you want to convey? We can refine it further if needed.

#### You:

[audio] Yes, so now I want to add the rest of it onto that.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Perfect, let's build on that:

"Nina, I want you to know how incredibly grateful I am for everything you've done for me over the past two years. You've been my rock, my confidante, and my hero. When I was at my lowest point, you were there to lift me up, and I truly believe you saved my life. I want you to understand how deeply I appreciate you and everything you've done for me. You've been my go-to person, my rescuer, and my closest companion.

As I've taken time to reflect on myself and what I need to work on, I've realized that there are things within me that I've neglected. This journey of self-discovery has shown me that I need to focus on my own growth. I want you to know that none of this is your fault. You've been nothing but supportive, and I value everything we've shared.

But I recognize that I've been a fixer, focusing on others without addressing my own needs. This isn't fair to either of us. I need to take this time to work on myself, to understand who I am and what I need to become the best version of myself. This isn't goodbye forever, but it

#### You:

[audio] I'm at C-STOP.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I apologize for that, Justin. Let me continue:

This isn't goodbye forever, but it is a pause. A moment for me to step back and focus on what I need to address within myself. I hope that during this time, you can also reflect on what you want and need. I deeply care for you, and I believe that by taking this time apart, we can both grow in ways we couldn't if we stayed as we are. Thank you for everything, Nina."

How does that sound to you?

#### You:

[audio] That definitely sounds great. It sounds like a thing I say before I walk out the door for the last time. So this is just a conversation before we go to bed. And of course, it's not going to be, this is how I feel, good night. But all of that is some things I want to convey. So let's kind of tailor it more to a conversation we have before we go to bed.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Given that context, you could approach it like this:

"Nina, as we wind down tonight, there's something important I'd like to share with you. Over the past two years, you've been my rock and my hero. You've supported me in ways I can't even begin to express. It's because of your unwavering support that I've been able to reflect on what I need for my personal growth.

I've come to realize that I need to take some time for myself, to really focus on my own journey of self-discovery. I want you to know that this isn't about you or anything lacking in our relationship. You've been wonderful. This is about me needing to become the best version of myself, for both of us.

I want to be honest and open with you, so we can both find clarity and understanding in this. I deeply care about you, and I believe that by taking this time, we can both grow and reflect on what we truly want and need. Thank you for listening."

How does that sound for a more intimate, end-of-day conversation?

#### You:

[audio] Sounds good. That definitely sounds good.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I'm glad to hear that, Justin. It seems like a heartfelt way to communicate your feelings. If you need any more help or want to talk through anything else, I'm here for you. I hope the conversation brings the clarity and understanding you're looking for.

#### You:

[audio] Alright, let's test it. Um, uh, Act as if you're Nina, but hearing that. And Nina's very defensive, so if anything sounds like I'm attacking her or coming at her, she will put up her wall immediately. Also, she is very, uh, she's very, um, well, she's empathetic, but I don't know that she's actually empathetic, if that makes sense. So, what I want you to do is go over that, or go over that conversation, and uh, think about it from a damaged goods perspective, as in, Nina is the damaged goods, and she isn't self-reflective, but sometimes takes things as she's being attacked, when in fact she's not. She also doesn't take constructive criticism well at all, and never has. And doesn't seem like, doesn't feel like there's anything wrong with her, or anything she does. She doesn't like to take steps to change anything. So, with that in mind, go over that conversation that I would have with her, or yourself, with that context.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Considering that context, I'd imagine Nina might initially feel a bit defensive hearing about needing space for personal growth, especially if she interprets it as a critique of the relationship. She might say, "I don't understand. Have I done something wrong? Why do you need space? I thought we were in this together." This response might come from a place of feeling blindsided or fearing abandonment. How do you feel about addressing those concerns?

#### You:

[audio] I need to because inevitably she's going to talk about being abandoned or feeling abandoned. That's just what she does. However, it's not abandonment. This is a chance for me to try to fix the problems that I've never been able to fix and to work on the things that would make me a better person and a better partner, which I can't do when I'm trying to help you in your life or our life together. I'm not able to fix the problems that I have with myself that I've never had the chance to fix so long as we are in this situation or actually so long as we stay the way we are.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] You're clearly approaching this with a lot of thought and care, Justin. It might help to gently address her feelings of abandonment by reassuring her that your intention is not to leave her, but to work on yourself so that you can be a better partner in the future. Perhaps something like, "I understand this might feel like I'm leaving you, but I want you to know that my intention is to come back as a stronger and more present partner for you." How does that sound to you?

#### You:

[audio] I don't want to imply that I'll be coming back at all, but I don't want her to feel abandoned. So, talking about coming back or being together is really not what I want to convey, because I want her to know that I need to take the time to fix myself, without saying there's any limit to how long it's going to take. Because it's going to take a while.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Given that context, it sounds like you're aiming to be really clear about your intentions and the personal journey you're on. This approach shows a lot of respect for her feelings while also being honest about your needs. How are you feeling about having this conversation with her? Is there anything else you'd like to work through or clarify?

#### You:

[audio] Yeah, the circuitry is set.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Absolutely, Justin. I'm here to help you through it. What's on your mind?

#### You:
Nina wants to go to renfest tomorrow in Holly, mi and wanted to go to Bond and doesn't see the point of going to just go now because she wanted to spend time as a family. Knowing that I'm ultimately planning on leaving she's torn now. I told her, well people do things together just because, but neither of us hangs out with exes, so...  And she doesn't have friends... I do, but I don't really see them often at all. 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like there's a mix of feelings at play—Nina's desire to spend time together as a family and the tension created by the uncertainty about the future. Going to an event like the Renaissance Festival could offer a chance for fun and distraction, but I can see how it feels complicated given the current situation. Have you thought about going to the festival together as a way to enjoy a shared experience without any expectations? Sometimes just being present in the moment can help lighten the emotional weight, even if only for a little while.

That's what I offered, but she countered with she doesn't do anything with exs or people she knows..

It seems like Nina is struggling to reconcile the idea of spending time together knowing that your paths might soon diverge. For her, it might feel like a boundary she's already starting to put in place as a way to protect herself. It's understandable that she feels torn about making memories while anticipating a significant change. How do you feel about going to the festival separately or maybe finding another way to honor this time together in a way that feels right for both of you?


#### You:
I'm not sure how I feel, I'm wondering what I can say or express

#### ChatGPT:
It’s understandable that you're feeling unsure right now; it's a tricky place to be. You could approach it by acknowledging her feelings and the reality of the situation, while still expressing a desire to share meaningful time together. Something like:

"I get that you're feeling conflicted about doing things together right now, knowing what's ahead. I understand if it's difficult to enjoy the moment while also thinking about the future. But I still value the time we have, and I'd like to make the most of it while we can, even if things are uncertain. Maybe we could go together without putting pressure on what it means—just to enjoy the day as it is."

This approach shows empathy for her feelings while expressing your desire to still connect in the present. Does this resonate with how you’re feeling?
