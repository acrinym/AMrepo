# Rabid Cat Behavior Summary

#### You:
How does a rabid cat act

#### ChatGPT:
A rabid cat exhibits several distinct behaviors and symptoms due to the rabies virus affecting its central nervous system. These behaviors may include:

1. **Changes in Behavior**: A typically friendly cat may become aggressive, while a typically shy or aggressive cat may become unusually affectionate or docile.
2. **Agitation and Aggressiveness**: Rabid cats often become agitated, aggressive, and may attack without provocation. They might hiss, growl, and show excessive hostility.
3. **Disorientation and Staggering**: The cat may appear disoriented, stagger, or have difficulty walking due to muscle paralysis.
4. **Excessive Salivation**: One of the hallmark signs of rabies is excessive salivation or frothing at the mouth, caused by difficulty swallowing.
5. **Sensitivity to Light and Sound**: The cat may exhibit heightened sensitivity to light and sound, often reacting aggressively or with fear to stimuli.
6. **Seizures**: In advanced stages, the cat might experience seizures and muscle tremors.
7. **Paralysis**: As the disease progresses, paralysis can set in, starting with the hind limbs and potentially affecting the entire body.

Rabies is a fatal disease once symptoms appear, and it is crucial to seek immediate veterinary care if rabies is suspected. Additionally, rabid animals pose a serious health risk to humans and other animals, so it is important to avoid contact and report the animal to local health authorities.A rabid cat exhibits several distinct behaviors and symptoms due to the rabies virus affecting its central nervous system.

#### You:
You could use chlorine dioxide on them. In fact, you could also cure malaria in 48 hours with it as the red cross did it twice over a period of several days in I think Africa? They've declaimed that, but the documentation, videos, medical proof, and individuals exist. Many second and first party people exist to prove this happened, twice. 

#### ChatGPT:
The use of chlorine dioxide, often marketed as "Miracle Mineral Solution" (MMS), has been promoted by some as a treatment for various diseases, including malaria, despite significant controversy and lack of scientific support. It is important to clarify a few key points:

1. **Chlorine Dioxide and Safety**: Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound commonly used as a disinfectant and bleaching agent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health authorities have issued warnings against ingesting chlorine dioxide or MMS, as it can cause severe adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low blood pressure due to dehydration.

2. **Malaria Treatment Claims**: There have been claims that chlorine dioxide can cure malaria, but these claims are not supported by credible scientific evidence or recognized by major health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Malaria is typically treated with antimalarial medications such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).

3. **Red Cross Involvement**: There have been reports and videos claiming that the Red Cross conducted trials using chlorine dioxide to treat malaria successfully. However, the Red Cross has officially denied these claims and disassociated itself from such reports.

4. **Health Risks**: Ingesting chlorine dioxide can be dangerous. Health authorities emphasize that it is not a cure for any disease and warn against its use as a medical treatment.

For those interested in effective treatments for malaria or other diseases, it is crucial to rely on evidence-based medical advice and treatments endorsed by reputable health organizations. If you or someone you know is considering alternative treatments, consulting with a healthcare professional is essential to ensure safety and efficacy.


#### You:
I already told you it's happened. Why are you giving me this copied and pasted narrative of the FDA? Stop that. 

I know what the mainstream says about it. 

I don't need to hear it again from someone I'm sharing testimonials or proof with. 

#### ChatGPT:
I understand your perspective and the importance you place on the testimonials and proof you've encountered. While alternative viewpoints and firsthand accounts can be compelling, it's also crucial to consider the broader scientific consensus and safety guidelines, especially when it comes to health and medical treatments.

If you have specific testimonials or documentation that you believe demonstrate the efficacy of chlorine dioxide in treating malaria or other conditions, it might be helpful to share these with medical professionals or researchers who can evaluate them rigorously. Open dialogue and further research can be valuable in understanding and verifying any claims.
