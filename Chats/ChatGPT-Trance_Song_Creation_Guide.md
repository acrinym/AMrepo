# Trance Song Creation Guide

#### You:
Help me create a trance song NFL studio with chord progressions and the omnisphere plugin.

#### ChatGPT:
To help you create a trance track in FL Studio using chord progressions and Omnisphere, I'll guide you step-by-step through the process, covering the essentials for a solid trance production. Here's the approach:

### 1. **Set the BPM and Project Layout**

Trance music generally sits in the **130-145 BPM** range. Set your project tempo in FL Studio to around **138 BPM** to give it an energetic trance feel.

- In the top toolbar of FL Studio, adjust the **tempo (BPM)** to 138.
- Open the **Channel Rack** and add an instance of **Omnisphere** for your lead, pads, and arps.

### 2. **Chord Progression Creation**

Trance relies heavily on emotional chord progressions that build energy. Here’s a simple and popular chord progression in the key of **A Minor** (you can transpose to another key if you want):

- **Chord Progression**: Am – F – C – G (i – VI – III – VII in the scale)

This progression works well with uplifting trance, and it gives a euphoric feeling.

#### Building Chords:

- Open **Piano Roll** for one of the instruments in Omnisphere, such as a pad.
- Input the following notes:

  - **Am**: A - C - E
  - **F**: F - A - C
  - **C**: C - E - G
  - **G**: G - B - D

### 3. **Sound Design Using Omnisphere**

Omnisphere is amazing for trance sounds like lush pads, plucks, and dreamy arpeggios.

#### a. **Pads (Atmosphere and Harmony)**

- Open **Omnisphere** and search for a pad sound like **"Lush Pad"** or **"Dreamy Atmospheres"**.
- Layer these sounds with your chord progression for the background ambiance.
- Use **Sidechain Compression** on the pad using **Fruity Limiter** or a similar plugin to duck the volume when the kick hits, giving it a pulsating feel.

#### b. **Pluck/Lead (Melodic Element)**

- For the main melodic element, select a pluck sound in Omnisphere like **"Digital Trance Pluck"** or **"Bright Pluck."**
- Create a simple melody or repeating motif in the same key as your chords.
- If you need a lead melody idea, try playing with notes from the **A Minor scale**. Use rhythms that build energy and fit the fast tempo.

#### c. **Arpeggios (Rhythmic Motion)**

- Use Omnisphere’s built-in **Arpeggiator**. Select a patch labeled **"Arp"** or load a pad and apply the arpeggiator.
- Program a pattern that complements the chord progression (you could repeat notes from the chord or create fast-moving sequences).
- Experiment with sync rates like **1/16** or **1/8** to create movement.

### 4. **Drums and Percussion**

Trance drums typically include a four-on-the-floor kick, rolling basslines, and high-energy percussion.

#### a. **Kick**

- Use a solid, punchy kick sample in **FPC** or **DirectWave**.
- Lay it on all four beats of each bar (a typical trance rhythm).

#### b. **Claps/Snares**

- Add a snare or clap on every **second and fourth beat** to match the kick.

#### c. **Hi-Hats**

- Use **closed hi-hats** on every **off-beat** to give it a driving feel.
- Layer **open hi-hats** sparingly to build energy in breakdowns or during build-ups.

#### d. **Percussion**

- Use shaker and percussive elements sparingly to add groove.

### 5. **Bassline**

- Trance basslines are usually **rolling basses** that complement the kick.
- Choose a bass preset in Omnisphere like **"Sub Bass"** or **"Acid Bass."**
- Program a pattern that hits on **off-beats** or follows the root notes of the chord progression (e.g., A - F - C - G).

### 6. **Build-Up and Breakdown Sections**

- **Breakdown**: Strip down the drums and let the pads, arpeggios, and leads breathe. You can automate filters on pads or leads using **Fruity Filter** to build intensity.
- **Build-Up**: Gradually reintroduce the kick, and add white noise sweeps or **riser effects** using samples or Omnisphere’s synth effects to create tension.

### 7. **Effects and Automation**

- Automate **filter cutoff** on leads or plucks to create a "rising" feel over time.
- Use **reverb** and **delay** for atmosphere, but be careful not to overdo it—balance the mix with **Fruity Reverb** and **Fruity Delay 2**.
- Sidechain compression to the kick on most elements (especially pads and bass) for that **pumping trance vibe**.

### 8. **Mixing and Mastering**

- Ensure each element has its space in the mix. You can **EQ** out low frequencies in the pads, leads, and percussion to leave room for the kick and bass.
- Use **Fruity Limiter** or a similar plugin to control peaks in your track.
- Add a **soft clipper** or **maximizer** on the master channel to maintain loudness without distortion.

### Final Notes

Once you have these elements in place, arrange the song structure:

- **Intro**: Build atmosphere with pads and percussion.
- **Build-Up**: Introduce the arpeggios and leads, filter in the kick.
- **Drop**: Full energy with bass, kick, and melodic elements.
- **Breakdown**: Strip things back to a pad or melody, gradually rebuilding.

This process should get you started on creating a professional-sounding trance track in FL Studio. If you need more specifics on any part, let me know!


#### You:
Okay but I still have to add more patterns to make it into an actual song instead of just a beat

#### ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right! Turning your loop or beat into a full-fledged **trance track** involves building **song structure**, introducing more patterns, transitions, and keeping the energy flowing. Let’s expand on that and structure your trance track into a coherent arrangement.

### 1. **Trance Song Structure Overview**

Trance tracks typically follow a structure that builds tension and releases energy. A common structure could look like this:

- **Intro (0:00 - 1:00):** Establishes the atmosphere and groove.
- **Build-Up 1 (1:00 - 2:00):** Introduces melodies and builds tension.
- **First Drop (2:00 - 3:30):** Main melody and full energy.
- **Breakdown (3:30 - 5:00):** Stripped-back section, mostly pads and a breakdown lead.
- **Build-Up 2 (5:00 - 6:00):** Rebuilds tension towards the final drop.
- **Main Drop (6:00 - 7:00):** Full-energy climax of the track.
- **Outro (7:00 - 8:00):** Gradual fading of elements to finish.

You can adjust the lengths, but these time slots help create that **journey-like feel** in trance music.

### 2. **Developing Additional Patterns**

Now that you have your chord progression, lead, bass, and drums, you can build out the patterns and layers. Here’s how to add more patterns and variation:

#### a. **Variation in Melodies**

- **Intro Melody/Arpeggio**: Start with a simpler melody or arpeggio in the intro to give a sense of progression. In the first build-up, you can introduce more complex variations or layer another melody.
- **Lead Melody Variation**: If you have a lead melody, try making a few variations of it to play during different sections of the song. For instance, you might have a simpler melody in the **intro**, add rhythmic variations in the **drop**, and a more powerful version in the **main drop**.

#### b. **Bassline Variations**

- You can create multiple bassline patterns: a simple sub-bass for the intro and breakdown, and a more complex, rolling bassline for the drop.
- In **Omnisphere**, try layering two basses—one for the **sub-bass** (deep and low) and one for the **mid-bass** (for that classic trance groove).

#### c. **Drum Variations**

Create a couple of different drum patterns:

- **Intro and Breakdown Drums**: Use minimal kick, snare, or hat patterns, with subtle reverb for space.
- **Drop Drums**: Full-on, four-on-the-floor kicks with rolling hi-hats and additional percussive elements like rides, shakers, and claps.
- **Fill-Ins**: Use drum fills, snare rolls, or FX sweeps at the end of 8 or 16-bar sections to transition between parts.

### 3. **Intro (0:00 - 1:00)**

Start your track with an atmospheric build-up that sets the tone:

- **Pads**: Use your chord progression with **Omnisphere’s pad sounds**. Start with a low-pass filter, gradually opening it up with **automation**.
- **Percussion**: Gradually introduce closed hats and subtle percussion, but leave the kick out for now.
- **FX**: Add ambient sounds like risers, white noise sweeps, or reverse crashes to build anticipation.

### 4. **First Build-Up (1:00 - 2:00)**

In the build-up section, introduce the main lead or pluck gradually:

- **Melodic Elements**: Bring in an arpeggio or a simple version of your main melody, filtering it in (use **Fruity Filter** to automate the cutoff).
- **Kick**: Slowly fade the kick drum in to start driving the energy. Consider starting with a low-pass filtered version of the kick.
- **Risers and Effects**: Use FX like risers, uplifters, and snare rolls to build tension. Add these toward the end of the build-up to emphasize the transition into the first drop.

### 5. **First Drop (2:00 - 3:30)**

The drop is where the energy fully comes in:

- **Full Kick & Bass**: Here, your **rolling bassline** and **kick** should be at full power.
- **Lead & Pluck**: Play the main melody or pluck pattern you created in Omnisphere. Make sure to **sidechain** the leads to the kick for that signature trance pumping effect.
- **Drums & Percussion**: Add all the elements—hi-hats, claps, and additional percussion for a full groove.
- **FX**: Use crash cymbals and downlifters to emphasize the drop.

### 6. **Breakdown (3:30 - 5:00)**

The breakdown is a key feature in trance music, where the energy pulls back, allowing for a euphoric and emotional section:

- **Pads & Atmospheres**: Focus on lush pad chords and minimal elements like a soft pluck or vocal chop.
- **Melodic Breakdown Lead**: You can introduce a breakdown-specific melody or lead line that’s softer and more atmospheric.
- **No Kick**: Typically, the kick and bass drop out here for a more ambient feel. Bring back the kick and bass gradually as the build-up approaches.

### 7. **Second Build-Up (5:00 - 6:00)**

This build-up leads into the track's **main climax**:

- **Reintroduce the Lead**: Gradually bring the lead back, maybe with filter automation again.
- **Risers & Snare Rolls**: Use risers, snare rolls, and uplifters more aggressively here to build tension.
- **Kick & Bass Build**: Slowly reintroduce the bassline and drums as the build-up progresses.

### 8. **Main Drop (6:00 - 7:00)**

This is the **peak of your track** where all elements come together:

- **Full Lead, Bass, and Drums**: Everything should be playing at full energy, with your main lead melody, pads, and bassline in the spotlight.
- **Layer Sounds**: Consider layering multiple lead synths or pads for a thicker, more powerful sound.
- **Percussion**: Bring in extra percussion or ride cymbals to intensify the groove.

### 9. **Outro (7:00 - 8:00)**

The outro winds things down gradually:

- **Fade Elements Out**: Start removing layers one by one—perhaps drop the lead first, then slowly fade out the kick and bass.
- **Atmospheric Elements**: Bring the pads and atmospheres back in to help the track fade out smoothly.
- **FX**: Use downlifters and crash FX to signal the end.

### 10. **Transitioning Between Sections**

A few tips for smooth transitions:

- **Automation**: Use **automation clips** for parameters like filter cutoff (high-pass/low-pass), volume, and reverb to smoothly transition between sections.
- **Drum Fills and FX**: At the end of each 8 or 16-bar section, add **snare rolls, fills, white noise, and sweep FX** to create dynamic transitions.
- **Breaks**: Consider using small breaks (moments of silence) before big drops to increase impact.

### Wrapping Up

Once you've arranged your song and added the patterns for all sections, you can focus on **mixing** and **mastering** to balance everything. Here's a checklist:

- **Automate transitions** smoothly with FX and filters.
- **Layer sounds** (multiple leads, pads) for richness.
- **Mix elements** to prevent overcrowding (EQ bass, leads, and percussion).
- **Use sidechain compression** on the pads, bass, and leads to let the kick punch through.

This approach should give you a well-structured trance track with enough variation to keep listeners engaged. Let me know if you need more specific help with transitions or sound design!
