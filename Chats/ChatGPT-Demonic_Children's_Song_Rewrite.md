I've seen pain and hurt,\
That's right!\
I've eaten dirt,\
That's true!\
It's hard to buy, but even I've been jilted by a skirt!\
He lied!

**\[Charlie:]**\
But look out, I'm still around!\
Oh yeah!\
'Cause you can't keep a good dog down!

**\[Itchy:]**\
You can't keep a good dog down!\
No, you can't keep a good dog down!

**\[Charlie:]**\
I've been bought and sold,\
He's been warm and cold,\
But ten to one I'll still be runnin' rackets when I'm old!

**\[Itchy:]**\
Not in some cage in the city pound!\
'Cause you can't keep a good dog!\
No, you can't keep a good dog!

**\[Both:]**\
No, you can't keep a good dog down!

**\[Charlie:]**\
In him there's a spark,\
That's right!\
That burns in the dark!

**\[Itchy:]**\
That'll never, ever extinguish!

**\[Charlie:]**\
Oh, that's right!\
Yes, you can stomp him, kick him, beat him, whack him,\
But if that dog has got some grit,\
Oh, ha-ha!

**\[Itchy:]**\
You just gotta admit!

**\[Charlie:]**\
He'll always find some way to make the time pass lit!

**\[Itchy:]**\

#### You:
How about turning the gzzzzzHD into something that could be what that means in demonic speech

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s an interpretation where the guttural and chaotic sounds like **"GRRRZZZZTTT"** or **"BLLLAAAAARRRRGGHHH"** are translated into demonic speech that conveys meaning, while maintaining their harsh, infernal tone:

---

**\[GRRRZZZZTTT]**\
*"Grizzh'thar"*: A guttural demonic word meaning *“awaken the wrath”*. Often used as a command to invoke chaos.

**\[BLLLAAAAARRRRGGHHH]**\
*"Blarr’ghal"*: A roaring cry of dominance, translating to *“I am eternal”* or *“unbroken power”*.

**\[SHRNNNNNNNN]**\
*"Shr’nak"*: A hissed declaration of *“shadows rising”*. Suggestive of an encroaching darkness.

**\[VREEEEEHHHZZZZ]**\
*"V’rezh"*: A screech of despair, interpreted as *“fall into torment”*. Used to intimidate or terrify.

**\[FNNNNNRRRRGGGHHHH]**\
*"Fnur’gath"*: A guttural sound meaning *“consume the weak”*. Often chanted in demonic rituals.

**\[KRRRAAAFFFFTTTT]**\
*"K’raftul"*: A barked command meaning *“break the chains”* or *“unleash destruction.”*

---

### Example in Context:

**\[Shrieking Groan]**\
*"Grizzh'thar! Blarr’ghal! Shr’nak V’rezh!*\
*Fnur’gath! K’raftul! Sh’narrrrthaz!!!"*

Translated:\
*"Awaken the wrath! I am eternal! Shadows rising, fall into torment!\
Consume the weak! Unleash destruction! Devour their souls!"*

---
