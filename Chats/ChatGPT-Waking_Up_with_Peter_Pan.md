**Waking Up with Wendy’s Peter Pan**

Sung to the tune of *Walking in a Winter Wonderland*

---

**Verse 1**\
Slept all night, feeling so cozy,\
Morning light, the air is rosy.\
But what’s this I see?\
It’s staring at me—\
I’m waking up with Wendy’s Peter Pan.

**Verse 2**\
Eyes wide, my heart is now racing,\
Can’t hide the sheer panic I’m facing.\
This isn’t my scene,\
What does this all mean?\
I’m waking up with Wendy’s Peter Pan.

**Bridge**\
In my bed, he’s lying there so smugly,\
Grinning like he’s planned this from the start.\
I don’t care if he thinks it’s all so lovely,\
I’m about to have a full-blown heart attack!

**Verse 3**\
Bolt upright, “Hey, dude, what’s your deal here?”\
“Just some fun!” he says with a sneer clear.\
This ain’t Neverland!\
“Dude, get off my hand!”\
I’m waking up with Wendy’s Peter Pan.

**Verse 4**\
Out the door, I’m running in my boxers,\
No more of this madness from imposters.\
What a strange new day,\
I’m moving away—\
No more waking up with Wendy’s Peter Pan.
