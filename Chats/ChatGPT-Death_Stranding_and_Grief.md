# Death Stranding and Grief

#### You:
Help me write a post for the death stranding reddit. Here's what I have so far and I've tagged it as discussion with flair so that people know that it's me trying to talk about it with others and engage in the topic. So death stranding just like all of hideo kojima's games, is very emotional. In fact, it's the most emotional game I ever played. Probably the most emotional media that I have consumed in a very long time. So I want to share something with the community that happened to me. 
Back in 2007, my first wife and I were going to have a baby. Well she had a daughter before that who had Pearson's syndrome which systemically shuts your organs down. I got to meet her daughter but she was only 11 months old total when she died. 
It wasn't long after that, when she got pregnant. We were excited and telling our families and.... Her family had a totally different perspective on it than mine. Everyone was afraid that the baby would get Pearson's syndrome again. So after months she decided she wasn't going to keep it. I had no choice but to go along with her decision because well lots of things, but I did try to stop her. The ending of my first child's life was the hardest day ever experienced. That day sucked the most out of all other of my almost 37 years. 

So here's where it ties into death stranding. Because of that situation in the loss of our child and then her subsequently becoming pregnant like a month afterwards I really had no time to mourn and I really didn't know how to mourn.. I still don't really understand the concept too much. So as I was going through the game and I got to the point where you take BB and go to the incinerator.. and BB's theme music plays... I embodied the lyrics wholly. 

Every single time I hear that song, I cry, because in real life I had prepared for our baby and then.. there was that. I never actually had a chance to experience my baby, or meet him in person. 

That song and that experience in the game has finally given me the chance to be able to mourn.

**Discussion: How Death Stranding Helped Me Mourn**

Death Stranding, like all of Hideo Kojima's games, is deeply emotional. For me, it's not just the most emotional game I’ve ever played—it’s also the most emotional piece of media I’ve experienced in a very long time. It brought up memories and feelings I hadn’t allowed myself to process for over a decade, and I wanted to share my story with this community.

Back in 2007, my first wife and I were expecting a baby. It was a bittersweet time because, before that, I had gotten to meet her daughter, who had Pearson's syndrome. For those unfamiliar, it’s a devastating condition that causes systemic organ failure. Her daughter only lived 11 months before she passed away.

When we found out she was pregnant, we were excited to share the news with our families, but their reactions were... different. While my family was supportive, hers was filled with fear, worried that the baby might inherit Pearson's syndrome. After months of emotional strain and debate, she decided she couldn’t go through with the pregnancy. I tried to stop her decision but ultimately had no control. It wasn’t just her choice—it was the weight of grief, fear, and everything that had happened before.

The day we lost our child was the hardest day of my life. It’s a wound that never fully healed. And because she became pregnant again shortly after, I had no time to process it. I didn’t know how to mourn then, and honestly, I still struggle with the concept today.

This is where Death Stranding comes in. That scene where you take BB to the incinerator and *BB’s Theme* plays completely broke me. The lyrics, the emotions—they hit me like a truck. I embodied every word of that song as if it was written for my experience.

In real life, I had prepared for our baby, and then everything was taken away. I never got to meet him, hold him, or be his dad. But through the game, through that song, I finally felt something I hadn’t been able to feel before: the ability to mourn.

Every time I hear *BB’s Theme*, I cry. And for the first time, I feel like it’s okay to cry. Death Stranding gave me something I didn’t even know I needed: closure. Or maybe not full closure, but at least a way to start processing everything.

I wanted to share this with the community because I know this game means something different to everyone. For me, it was a profound way to connect with my grief, even years later. Thank you, Kojima Productions, for crafting something so beautiful and personal.

Does anyone else have experiences with Death Stranding that hit this deeply? Or moments in the game that resonated with something personal in your life? I’d love to hear your stories.
