#### ChatGPT:
The built-in Windows benchmark you're likely referring to is the "Windows System Assessment Tool" (WinSAT). It was designed to evaluate the performance of your computer's hardware and provide a rating called the Windows Experience Index (WEI). This tool can measure various aspects like CPU performance, memory, graphics, and disk speed. You can still access it via the command prompt by typing `winsat formal` to run a formal assessment of your system. However, in more recent versions of Windows, the graphical interface for viewing WEI scores was removed, so it's primarily accessible through command-line tools or third-party utilities.The built-in Windows benchmark you're likely referring to is the "Windows System Assessment Tool" (WinSAT).
