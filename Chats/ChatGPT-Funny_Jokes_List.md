#### You:
Not Dad Jones though. Longer form kind

#### ChatGPT:
Gotcha! Here are some longer-form jokes that should give you a good laugh:

1. **The Talking Dog for Sale:**
   A guy sees a sign in front of a house: “Talking Dog for Sale.” He rings the bell, and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy walks into the backyard and asks the dog, “Can you talk?”
   “Yep,” the dog replies.
   “So, what’s your story?”
   The dog looks up and says, “Well, I discovered I could talk when I was young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. They had me jetting around the world, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one would ever suspect a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years. But the travel really wore me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger. So, I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a bunch of medals. I got married, had a few puppies, and now I’m just retired.”
   Amazed, the guy asks the owner how much he wants for the dog.
   “Ten dollars,” the owner replies.
   “Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why so cheap?”
   “Because he’s a liar. He never did any of that stuff.”

2. **The Genie in a Bar:**
   A man walks into a bar and sees a tiny piano and a one-foot-tall man playing it. He asks the bartender, “What’s this?”
   The bartender replies, “Well, there’s a genie in the back who grants wishes, but there’s a catch.”
   Intrigued, the man goes to the back and finds the genie. “I wish for a million bucks,” he says.
   Suddenly, the bar is filled with a million ducks, quacking and flapping everywhere.
   Confused, the man returns to the bartender. “I think your genie is hard of hearing. I asked for a million bucks, not ducks.”
   The bartender nods, “Yeah, I know. Do you really think I asked for a 12-inch pianist?”

3. **The Engineer, The Chemist, and the Economist:**
   Three people are stranded on a desert island: an engineer, a chemist, and an economist. They’re desperately hungry and find a can of beans washed ashore. But they have no can opener.
   The engineer suggests, “Let’s hit the can with a rock until it opens.”
   The chemist counters, “We could build a fire and heat the can until it bursts open.”
   The economist interjects, “Let’s assume we have a can opener.”

4. **The Parrot with a Bad Attitude:**
   A man buys a parrot only to have it constantly insult him. He tries everything to make it stop but to no avail. Finally, in frustration, he puts the parrot in the freezer.
   After a few minutes, the insults stop. The man thinks he may have killed the parrot, so he opens the freezer. The parrot calmly walks out and says, “I apologize for my behavior and will never insult you again. By the way, what did the chicken do?”

5. **The Talking Frog:**
   A man is walking through the woods when he stumbles upon a frog sitting on a log. The frog looks up at him and says, “Kiss me, and I’ll turn into a beautiful princess.”
   The man picks up the frog and puts it in his pocket.
   The frog speaks up again, “Didn’t you hear me? I said kiss me, and I’ll turn into a beautiful princess!”
   The man takes the frog out of his pocket and says, “Look, I’m a software engineer. I don’t have time for a girlfriend. But a talking frog, now that’s cool!”

6. **The Ultimate Sacrifice:**
   Three men are hiking through a forest when they come across a large raging river. They need to get to the other side but have no idea how to cross it. The first man prays, “God, please give me the strength to cross the river.” Poof! He has big arms and strong legs and swims across the river in about two hours.
   Seeing this, the second man prays, “God, please give me the strength and the tools to cross the river.” Poof! He gets a rowboat and rows across the river in about an hour.
   The third man prays, “God, please give me the strength, the tools, and the intelligence to cross the river.” Poof! He turns into a woman. She checks the map, hikes a hundred yards upstream, and walks across the bridge.

7. **The Rich Man and the Beggar:**
   A rich man sees a beggar on the street and decides to give him a job. “I’ll pay you $50 for every time you paint my porch,” the rich man says.
   The next day, the beggar returns and says, “I’ve finished painting your porch. And by the way, it’s not a porch, it’s a Ferrari.”

8. **The Inheritance:**
   A man on his deathbed calls his three sons and tells them, “I have a box of valuable items I want you to share equally.”
   After his death, the sons open the box and find three nuts. Confused, the eldest son cracks open a nut and finds a diamond inside. The second son cracks open his nut and finds a gold nugget. The youngest son opens his nut and finds a slip of paper. It reads, “Sorry, son, you got the nut.”

9. **The Horse in the Bar:**
   A horse walks into a bar and the bartender says, “Hey.”
   The horse replies, “Sure.”

10. **The Bear and the Rabbit:**
    A bear and a rabbit are in the woods when they stumble upon a genie. The genie says, “I’ll grant each of you three wishes.”
    The bear says, “I wish all the bears in this forest were female.” Poof! All the bears are female.
    The rabbit says, “I wish for a motorcycle helmet.” Poof! He gets a helmet.
    The bear, amazed, says, “I wish all the bears in the next forest were female too.” Poof! All the bears in the next forest are female.
    The rabbit says, “I wish for a motorcycle.” Poof! He gets a motorcycle.
    The bear, not wanting to be outdone, says, “I wish all the bears in the world were female.” Poof! All the bears are female.
    The rabbit puts on his helmet, revs up his motorcycle, and says, “I wish the bear was gay.” Poof!

Hope these jokes gave you a good chuckle!
