Ellie and her friend, I think aren't gay, but exploring things. When they kiss during left behind. 

#### ChatGPT:
In *The Last of Us: Left Behind*, Ellie and her friend Riley share a deeply emotional and pivotal moment when they kiss. This scene has been the subject of much discussion, but its interpretation largely depends on the viewer's perspective and the context provided by the game.

Here’s a closer look:

### Emotional Context

- **Young and Curious**: Ellie and Riley are teenagers navigating a complex, dangerous post-apocalyptic world. Their bond is built on shared experiences, trust, and companionship. At this age, exploring feelings, boundaries, and emotions is natural, especially in an environment where normal childhood experiences are absent.
- **The Kiss**: When they kiss, it feels spontaneous and genuine, stemming from the strong bond they share. It’s an expression of their connection, which might be romantic, platonic, or a mix of both, depending on how you view it.

### Sexual Identity

- **Exploration vs. Identity**: The kiss may represent exploration, as many teenagers go through phases of understanding their emotions and attractions. Alternatively, it can be seen as Ellie beginning to realize her identity as someone who is romantically interested in women.
- **Ellie's Canonical Identity**: Later in *The Last of Us Part II*, Ellie’s romantic relationship with Dina confirms her identity as a lesbian. This suggests the kiss with Riley was more than just exploration—it was an authentic moment of connection and attraction.

### The Intent of the Scene

The writers likely intended this scene to be a deeply personal moment, showing the depth of Ellie and Riley’s relationship. Whether it’s seen as exploration or a genuine romantic connection, the kiss underscores the humanity of the characters, even in a world filled with loss and survival.

In short, while Ellie and Riley's kiss could be viewed as an exploration of feelings, the broader narrative of Ellie’s story points toward it being an authentic expression of her identity and emotions.
