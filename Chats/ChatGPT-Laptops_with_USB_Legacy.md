# Laptops with USB Legacy

#### You:
I need a nice 2017+ laptop that has usb3.1 +/- thunderbolt and USB 3.0 ports(or just usb3.1 with USB 2 /a ports so I can plug in older components) that isn't uefi only, so has a bios. 

#### ChatGPT:
Finding a laptop with the specific features you're looking for—USB 3.1 (and potentially Thunderbolt), USB 3.0 ports (or USB 2.0 Type-A for legacy compatibility), and a BIOS (instead of UEFI only) can be a bit of a challenge since most modern systems tend to lean towards UEFI for security and performance improvements. However, some manufacturers have laptops with a "Legacy Boot" option, which can give you that BIOS-like functionality.

Here are a few options you can consider:

### 1. **Dell Latitude 7000 Series (2017+)**

- **USB Ports**: Typically equipped with USB 3.1 Type-C (with optional Thunderbolt) and USB 3.0 Type-A ports.
- **BIOS/UEFI**: Dell Latitude models often come with both UEFI and Legacy Boot options in the BIOS settings.

#### You:
Desktop replacements huh

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, most of these laptops, particularly the **Dell Precision 7760**, **Lenovo ThinkPad P17**, and **Alienware Area-51m R2**, are considered **desktop replacements**. These machines pack in high-end CPUs, GPUs, and plenty of RAM, often surpassing the capabilities of mid-range desktops. Here are a few key characteristics of desktop replacement laptops:

### Why Desktop Replacements Might Be a Good Fit:

1. **Performance**: They feature top-tier GPUs like the RTX 3080 or Quadro RTX series, which are powerful enough for gaming, rendering, ray tracing, and professional tasks like 3D modeling and CAD.
2. **Expandability**: They support a large amount of RAM (64GB+), with some going up to 128GB, making them ideal for heavy multitasking and future-proofing your setup.
3. **Port Flexibility**: They have a full suite of ports (USB 3.0/3.1/Thunderbolt, HDMI, Ethernet, etc.), similar to a desktop, allowing for easy connection to multiple peripherals, monitors, and external drives.
4. **Cooling**: These machines typically have enhanced cooling systems to handle the high-performance components, keeping temperatures manageable under heavy workloads.

### Drawbacks to Consider:

- **Size & Weight**: These laptops are usually heavier and bulkier compared to traditional laptops. They're portable but not ultralight.
- **Battery Life**: Due to the high-performance components, battery life can be shorter compared to more power-efficient laptops.

If you’re looking for something that can match or exceed desktop performance while still being portable (at least to an extent), these desktop replacements are perfect. However, if you want something more portable, there are thinner and lighter laptops, but they might not pack the same GPU and RAM capabilities you're seeking.


#### You:
Oh it's fine if battery life is low, I just want power cause it'll spend the majority of time plugged in

#### ChatGPT:
In that case, focusing on pure performance and power makes sense. Since battery life isn't a priority for you, these desktop replacement options should suit your needs perfectly. The powerful GPUs, large RAM capacity, and robust CPUs will handle anything you throw at them, whether it's gaming, rendering, or multitasking. Being plugged in most of the time will allow these machines to run at full capacity without worrying about power limitations.

Here are a couple of quick additional points:

- **Thermal Management**: Since these laptops will be plugged in most of the time, you might want to consider investing in a good cooling pad to help manage heat, as these powerful components can generate a lot of it during extended use.

- **Customizable Performance**: Some of these machines, like the Alienware Area-51m R2, even allow for component upgrades, making them a long-term investment, as you can swap out GPUs and CPUs as newer versions come out.

If you go with one of these options, you’ll get the desktop-level performance you need while keeping the flexibility of portability when necessary!
