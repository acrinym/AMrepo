So I'm trying to talk to my son about why this is not my weekend and I shouldn't pick him up on it even though I guess his mom has it set up that way. It's not my weekend because we switched for the first holiday of the month back on the 9th or whatever it was so that she had mother's Day or I don't remember what day it was, but the first weekend of the month. Are the first holiday of the month. He wants me to keep this weekend because he needs support but I don't want to go against the court order. This is what I was going to say...

**Suggested Message to Ayden:**

> Hey buddy, I hear you—really. I know this weekend feels important, and I want to be there for you always.
>
> But this one isn’t mine. We switched earlier in the month—around the 9th, I think—so your mom could have that holiday weekend (maybe Mother’s Day). That shift threw off the whole schedule for May.
>
> I have to stick to the order, even when others don’t, because it helps keep things stable—not just for me, but for you too.
>
> I’m not saying no because I don’t want to see you. I’m saying no because I’m trying to protect both of us from chaos and confusion down the road.
>
> Let’s figure something out soon though, okay? Maybe I can see you during the week or do something special next time we’re together. I love you.
