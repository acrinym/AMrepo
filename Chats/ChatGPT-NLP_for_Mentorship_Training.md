# NLP for Mentorship Training

#### You:
I do tech support - you already know my occupation, how long I'[ve done it. I recently was invited to become a mentor and am in training now for that. 

I will be training a new employee for 4 weeks. I would like to help develop or provide feeback to the program managers for using nlp techniques with customers and with each other. Let's build suggestions for the mentorship program using things like how to builod rapport, etc etc. 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Here are some suggestions for incorporating NLP techniques into your mentorship program to build rapport and enhance interactions with customers and colleagues:

### **Mentorship Program Suggestions**

1. **Building Rapport:**
   - **Mirroring and Matching:** Teach mentors and mentees to subtly match the tone, pace, and body language of their conversational partners. For instance:
     - When speaking with customers, match their energy level and use similar language patterns.
     - With colleagues, reflect their communication style to create alignment and comfort.
   - **Using Preferred Modalities:** Identify whether customers or colleagues prefer visual, auditory, or kinesthetic language and tailor responses accordingly. For example:
     - Visual: "I see what you mean."
     - Auditory: "I hear what you're saying."
     - Kinesthetic: "I feel like we're on the same page."

2. **Active Listening:**
   - Encourage paraphrasing customer concerns to ensure understanding: "So, if I understand correctly, you're experiencing..."
   - Train mentees to pause briefly after a customer finishes speaking to process and validate what was said.

3. **Reframing Challenges:**
   - Teach mentees how to frame solutions positively:
     - Instead of saying, "I can't do that," offer alternatives: "What I can do is..."
     - Shift negative customer feedback into opportunities for growth: "I appreciate your feedback—it helps us improve."

4. **Effective Questioning:**
   - Use open-ended questions to uncover more about customer needs or team challenges: "Can you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?"
   - Avoid leading questions that might bias responses.

5. **State Management:**
   - Show mentees how to manage their emotional states during high-pressure interactions:
     - Use anchoring techniques to recall calm, confident states before engaging with challenging customers or scenarios.
     - Teach short breathing exercises or visualization to reset their focus.

6. **Chunking Information:**
   - Guide mentees on breaking down complex information into smaller, manageable pieces for customers:
     - "First, we’ll check your account details. Then, we’ll look into resolving the issue."
   - Use this technique to structure training modules for new employees.

7. **Encouraging Feedback and Reflection:**
   - Teach mentees to request feedback using NLP strategies like assumptive questions: "What went well in our interaction today, and what could be even better next time?"
   - Train them to use language that fosters openness in team environments.

8. **Goal Setting with Well-Formed Outcomes:**
   - Introduce a framework for defining goals using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) method.
   - Encourage mentees to visualize successful interactions to mentally rehearse outcomes.

9. **Storytelling for Training:**
   - Use stories and metaphors to explain complex concepts, as they are memorable and engaging.
   - Share personal experiences to illustrate points during training sessions.

10. **Building a Feedback Loop:**
    - Include NLP techniques for constructive feedback:
      - Start with positive reinforcement.
      - Offer constructive critique framed as opportunities.
      - End with an encouragement or affirmation of skills.

### **Feedback to Program Managers**

- Suggest incorporating a brief module on NLP principles for all new employees, emphasizing rapport-building and communication skills.
- Recommend interactive role-playing scenarios that allow mentees to practice NLP techniques in simulated customer interactions.
- Offer to collaborate on developing resources like cheat sheets or quick-reference guides for NLP-based communication strategies.

Let me know if you’d like help expanding any of these ideas into detailed training modules or feedback points!


#### You:
The mentors / mentees will not have NLP training like myself, so I can't just tell them to "use anchoring". But I could explain it to them. 
ACD Sla for calls is ~15 minutes. Generally. Keep that in mind. 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Given that the mentors and mentees won't have NLP training and that call handling must be efficient due to the 15-minute SLA, here are tailored suggestions for incorporating NLP principles in a practical and time-conscious way:

### **Mentorship Program Adjusted for SLA**

1. **Simplifying NLP Concepts:**
   - **Anchoring:** Explain as a quick emotional reset:
     - "Think of a moment when you felt confident and calm. Take a deep breath, recall that moment, and carry that feeling into the call."
   - Teach mentors to model this technique during stressful moments for mentees.

2. **Rapid Rapport Building:**
   - **Tone and Energy Matching:** Frame it as "match their vibe":
     - If a customer is frustrated, maintain calm but show urgency in your tone.
     - If a customer is cheerful, reflect their energy to create an easy connection.
   - **Common Ground:** Train mentees to pick up on cues from the customer (e.g., references to their location, past interactions) and use those conversationally.

3. **Quick Problem Framing:**
   - Use a **problem-solution structure**:
     - "Here’s what’s happening, and here’s what we’re going to do to fix it."
   - Encourage mentees to focus on what can be done rather than what cannot, keeping explanations concise and solution-focused.

4. **Active Listening in Action:**
   - Demonstrate and encourage techniques like:
     - **Echoing Key Points:** “So, you’re saying the system crashes when you open this file?”
     - **Acknowledging Emotions:** "I understand how frustrating this must be, and I’ll do my best to resolve it."

5. **Efficient Questioning Techniques:**
   - Train mentees to ask **precision questions**:
     - Start with open-ended ones: "Can you describe the steps leading up to the issue?"
     - Follow with clarifying ones: "Just to confirm, this happens when you click 'Save,' correct?"

6. **Handling Emotional States (For Calls):**
   - Teach simple self-regulation methods:
     - Before answering a call, take a deep breath to center focus.
     - Use posture (e.g., sitting upright) to influence tone positively.
   - Offer a quick "reset phrase" like: "Take a second if you feel overwhelmed, and remind yourself you're here to help."

7. **Chunking for Clarity:**
   - Teach mentees to break down instructions for customers:
     - "Let’s tackle this step by step. First, can you open your settings?"
     - Avoid overloading customers with multiple steps at once.

8. **Role-Playing Scenarios:**
   - Use brief, time-boxed simulations to practice call flow, focusing on:
     - Quick rapport building.
     - Reframing challenges: “That’s tricky, but here’s how we can make it work.”
     - Handling a frustrated caller by acknowledging concerns and steering toward solutions.

9. **Feedback During Mentorship:**
   - Teach mentors to provide **sandwiched feedback**:
     - Start with what went well: "You did great acknowledging the customer’s issue."
     - Offer a suggestion: "Next time, try asking a clarifying question earlier."
     - End with encouragement: "You’re doing a great job staying calm under pressure."

10. **Short, Actionable Tips for Mentors:**
    - Provide mentors with a "Quick Tips" guide summarizing the above ideas to refer to during training sessions or calls.

Would you like a more detailed version of these ideas or help creating role-play scenarios?


#### You:
Not role playing, because neither customers or agents(mentees) or (employees) will have access to video calls. 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Without video calls, the mentorship program can focus on refining verbal communication and leveraging tone, language, and auditory cues to build rapport and manage interactions effectively. Here’s an updated plan tailored for audio-only contexts:

### **Audio-Only Mentorship Program Suggestions**

1. **Tone Awareness:**
   - **Mirroring Tone:** Teach mentees to adjust their tone to match the customer's emotional state:
     - If a customer sounds frustrated, use a calm, measured tone to de-escalate.
     - For upbeat customers, adopt a warm and friendly tone to maintain rapport.
   - Emphasize the importance of clarity and enunciation, especially for technical explanations.

2. **Auditory Cues:**
   - Train mentees to listen for verbal cues, such as changes in pitch or pauses, to gauge a customer’s emotional state.
   - Encourage active listening by summarizing or repeating key points to confirm understanding: “Just to clarify, you’re unable to log in to the application, correct?”

3. **Empathy Statements:**
   - Provide mentees with a list of empathetic phrases that can be used across various scenarios:
     - "I completely understand how that can be frustrating."
     - "Thank you for your patience; I know this must be inconvenient."

4. **Script Flexibility:**
   - Teach mentees how to personalize scripted responses to sound natural:
     - Instead of reading verbatim, encourage phrasing that aligns with the mentee’s speaking style.
   - Provide examples of how to adapt scripts to different emotional tones.

5. **Handling Silence:**
   - Train mentees to use silence strategically:
     - Allow pauses for the customer to process information or ask questions.
     - Avoid speaking over customers and wait for them to finish before responding.

6. **Conciseness Under Time Constraints:**
   - Emphasize brevity without losing empathy or detail:
     - Teach mentees to prioritize information by stating the most critical steps first.
     - Encourage phrasing like, “Here’s the most important thing to focus on…”

7. **Self-Regulation for Audio Calls:**
   - Suggest methods for maintaining composure during difficult calls:
     - Take a deep breath before responding to challenging questions.
     - Use visual aids (e.g., a sticky note with a smiley face) near the phone to remind them to maintain a positive tone.

8. **Feedback Through Audio Recordings:**
   - If possible, mentors can review recorded calls with mentees to highlight strengths and areas for improvement.
   - Focus on auditory aspects like tone, pacing, and how effectively the mentee resolved the issue within the SLA.

9. **Pre-Call Preparation:**
   - Teach mentees to mentally rehearse key points or FAQs before answering calls.
   - Encourage them to glance over customer notes, if available, to personalize the interaction.

10. **Follow-Up and Check-Ins:**
    - Train mentees to end calls on a high note, even if the issue isn’t fully resolved:
      - "I’ll make sure to follow up with you as soon as I have more information."
      - "Thank you for your patience, and I’ll check back to ensure everything works as expected."

Would you like to refine these ideas further or develop training materials for them?


#### You:
We don't generally follow up with customers UNLESS the call / resolution is not reached during the call and we're waiting on a process to finish / customer to finish a  process. 
In that case, the ticket (only for forest service, not other agencies) goes to Customer Care for follow up in 24 hours - random agents who work customer care pick them up later and contact back via teams, email or calls.But on the call, we don't reference following up. Unless escalating the call to T2, etc. We can tell them something to the effect of "once we escalate the ticket, a tier 2 agent will follow up with you as soon as they can" or similar verbiage.  

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Based on this clarification, here’s a refined set of suggestions tailored to your process:

### **Updated Mentorship Suggestions for Call Handling**

1. **Clarity During Escalations:**
   - Provide mentees with standard phrases for escalations:
     - "This ticket will be escalated to Tier 2, and a Tier 2 agent will follow up with you as soon as possible."
     - Avoid ambiguous terms like "soon" without context; if possible, provide a realistic timeframe.

2. **Setting Expectations:**
   - Train mentees to set accurate expectations about what will happen next:
     - For example: "Once the process completes on your end, Customer Care will review the ticket and reach out to you if needed, typically within 24 hours."
     - Reinforce that they should not commit to actions they won’t personally handle (e.g., follow-ups).

3. **Avoiding Premature Follow-Up Promises:**
   - Emphasize phrases that communicate progress without implying direct follow-up:
     - "Once the process finishes, the system will log the results for further review by our team."
     - For escalations: "I'll ensure this is documented and escalated for a Tier 2 agent to review."

4. **Efficient Information Gathering:**
   - Teach mentees to ask targeted questions to streamline resolutions:
     - "Can you describe what happens when you attempt this process?"
     - Focus on concise yet thorough documentation for Customer Care or Tier 2 to minimize back-and-forth.

5. **Transitioning Calls Smoothly:**
   - Provide scripts for when tickets are escalated:
     - "I’ve escalated your case with all the details provided. You’ll be contacted by a Tier 2 agent to continue troubleshooting."
     - Avoid phrasing that suggests the original agent will maintain involvement.

6. **Handling Long Processes on Calls:**
   - Teach mentees to navigate scenarios where processes take time to complete:
     - "This process may take a few minutes. While we wait, I’ll stay on the line to assist if anything unexpected happens."
     - Offer reassurances like: "If everything completes without issue, no further action is needed on our end."

7. **Conveying Confidence and Resolution:**
   - Even when transitioning the case, end the call with confidence:
     - "We’ve documented everything needed, and the next steps are clear for the team that will follow up."

8. **Training for Escalation and Customer Care Handoffs:**
   - Provide mentees with an understanding of what Customer Care typically handles to guide their language:
     - "If you encounter any issues after the process, Customer Care is there to assist."

Would you like templates or specific examples of scripts for these scenarios?


#### You:
"Cases" are HR only. We use Tickets. :) 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Got it! I'll ensure to use "tickets" consistently when referring to your team's processes. Let me know if you need further refinements or examples tailored to your environment.


#### You:
At end of calls we say something like "I'll get your ticket escalated, and you should get a customer service survey and a confirmation email with your ticket number as the referrence number in it." 

I don't know if we actually mention customer care either, just that someone should follow up (if a call needs it) withn 24 hours. 


#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Here's an updated version of call handling tailored to these details:

### **Refined Call Handling Suggestions for Mentorship**

1. **Ending the Call with Clarity:**
   - Train mentees to use consistent phrasing:
     - "I’ll get your ticket escalated, and you should receive a confirmation email with your ticket number for reference. You may also receive a customer service survey about your experience today."
     - For follow-up situations: "If follow-up is needed, someone should reach out within 24 hours."

2. **Avoiding Over-Promising:**
   - Ensure mentees avoid committing to specific follow-up agents or timelines beyond general guidance:
     - "Your ticket will be reviewed by the appropriate team, and they’ll contact you if necessary."

3. **Reinforcing Next Steps:**
   - For escalations: "Once escalated, the appropriate team will review this ticket and take the next steps."
   - For process-related delays: "After the process completes, the team will have everything they need to continue resolving this for you."

4. **Providing Assurance Without Over-Detailing:**
   - For situations requiring follow-up: "Rest assured, all the necessary details have been included in your ticket for the next team to address."

Would you like this formatted into a shareable document, or is there anything else you’d like to include?


#### You:
Yeah a shareable document would be nice. 

#### ChatGPT:
The quick reference guide has been created and is ready for you to share. Let me know if there are any additional adjustments you'd like!


#### You:
Export to docx

#### ChatGPT:
The document has been exported as a Word file. You can download it using the link below:

[Download the Mentorship Quick Reference Guide](sandbox:/mnt/data/Mentorship_Quick_Reference_Guide.docx)


#### You:
Can you remove "nlp references" from the document, but leave the feedback/suggestions that would be using NLP anyway? I don't want to scare anyone with "NLP". 

#### ChatGPT:
The document has been updated to remove explicit references to "NLP" while retaining the practical suggestions and feedback techniques. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust or refine!


#### You:
Now go back over how I modified and spruce it up. 

#### ChatGPT:
I’ve suggested some refinements to enhance clarity and practicality, particularly in areas related to setting expectations, handling customer emotions, and providing actionable examples. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust!


#### You:
Oh, go ahead and modify it. 

#### ChatGPT:
I've polished the document to enhance clarity and flow while maintaining professionalism. Let me know if there’s anything more you’d like to tweak!


#### You:
Can you add a few tips about how to break conversation when a customer is  telling stories or you need to end a call because it's getting too long? Often we can escalate if the processes will take too long or there will be too many tools / steps involved. For example, we review an issue, and we realize it reequires permissions / tools we dont have access to at tier 1 - at that point we would gather requisite escalation information (templates) and route up, acknowledging that it looks like the ticket will need to be routed (or escalated) to tier 2. If customer asks what tier 2 is, we can tell them "Tier 2 is the next higher helpdesk, or the hands-on / deskside support where they work with higher permissions and tools and do physical work on computers (simplify this).  

#### ChatGPT:
I've added tips for redirecting lengthy conversations, managing time, and explaining Tier 2 support more clearly. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to refine or expand!


#### You:
What are some things we can say if a customer is strongly opposed to escalation (due to bad experience/bad t2 agents, whatever, we don't know their story)? 

#### ChatGPT:
I've added tips to address customers who are hesitant about escalation, emphasizing reassurance and transparency. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!


#### You:
(The suggestions should be stated that if customer has reservations about escalation, then we provide positive feedback about t2) - "I understand that you may not want to escalate, but unfortunately, we just don't have the tools (or permissions) to do X at tier 1, so we'll have to send it to tier 2 for escalation. "

Context (see attached file) - this is ONLY for forest service though. 

#### ChatGPT:
To address situations where customers are strongly opposed to escalation, I'll integrate relevant phrasing into the **"When Escalating Tickets"** section, considering the context provided in your attached document. Here's the updated section:

---

#### **When Escalating Tickets:**

1. Clearly set expectations:
   - "Your ticket will be escalated, and a Tier 2 agent will be in touch. Unfortunately, I can't provide a timeline as that's determined by their workload."
2. Simplify explanations about Tier 2:
   - "Tier 2 is the next higher helpdesk or deskside support team. They have additional permissions and tools to resolve issues or perform hands-on work on devices."
3. Address customer concerns about escalation:
   - "I understand you might have reservations about escalation based on past experiences. Unfortunately, Tier 1 does not have the necessary permissions or tools to resolve this issue fully. Escalating ensures it reaches the experts equipped to handle it efficiently."
   - "Our goal is to resolve this efficiently, and Tier 2 is best equipped to handle cases that require deeper access or hands-on work."
   - "I’ll make sure all necessary details are included in the ticket to minimize back-and-forth for you."
   - "I know previous experiences might not have been ideal, but Tier 2 support has access to tools and solutions that are essential for resolving this type of issue."

Would you like me to incorporate this into the document and reformat it for emphasis? Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!


#### You:
Yeah, and review the document I just sent you for forest-service specific escalations and customer check-ups of existing tickets. 

#### ChatGPT:
I've incorporated your suggestions for addressing customer reservations about escalation, clarifying the role of Tier 2, and providing Forest Service-specific guidance for tracking tickets. Let me know if there’s anything more you’d like to enhance!


#### You:
You could expand on this by including a specific example or strategy, like using a neutral phrase to redirect focus to the solution.

#### ChatGPT:
I've expanded the section with a specific example and strategy to help redirect the customer's focus to the solution while maintaining a calm tone. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like adjusted!


#### You:
Consider adding an example relevant to common issues mentees might encounter to make this guidance more practical.

#### ChatGPT:
The section has been updated with a relevant example to make it more practical and relatable for mentees. Let me know if there’s anything else to refine!


#### You:
Now, do you have the document I sent you? You haven't incorporated anything from that into the ticket. 

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarification. I’ll now incorporate relevant elements from the Forest Service escalation document into the quick reference guide. Key areas to focus on include:

1. **Escalation Process Specifics:** Emphasizing procedures, timelines, and ensuring clear instructions for Tier 1 agents when routing tickets to Tier 2.
2. **Tracking Tickets:** Including guidance on how customers can check the status of their tickets and the importance of using the appropriate channels (e.g., Digital Workplace or My Activity).
3. **Forest Service-Specific Details:** Highlighting any restrictions or requirements unique to the Forest Service, such as avoiding chat or email for escalations.

I’ll update the document and integrate these points effectively.


#### ChatGPT:
The document has been updated with Forest Service-specific escalation details and guidance for tracking tickets, ensuring it aligns with the context of the attached file. Let me know if further refinements or additions are needed!


#### You:
Well, no, I meant if a customer is callingt on a ticket that has been unassigned (or has been assisned but has seen no progress) within 4 days, they can call to have it escalated - per the documentation I just sent you. 

#### ChatGPT:
To address the situation where a customer is calling about an unassigned ticket or one with no progress after four business days, I’ll integrate this information into the **"When Escalating Tickets"** section. Here’s the adjusted version:

---

#### **When Escalating Tickets:**

1. **Clearly set expectations:**
   - "Your ticket will be escalated, and a Tier 2 agent will be in touch. Unfortunately, I can't provide a timeline as that's determined by their workload."

2. **Simplify explanations about Tier 2:**
   - "Tier 2 is the next higher helpdesk or deskside support team. They have additional permissions and tools to resolve issues or perform hands-on work on devices."

3. **Address customer concerns about escalation:**
   - "I understand you may not want to escalate based on past experiences, but unfortunately, Tier 1 does not have the tools or permissions to resolve this issue fully. Escalating ensures it reaches the experts equipped to handle it."
   - "Our goal is to resolve this efficiently, and Tier 2 is best equipped to handle cases that require deeper access or hands-on work."
   - "I’ll make sure all necessary details are included in the ticket to minimize back-and-forth for you."
   - "You can track the status of your incident through the Digital Workplace or My Activity portal, and if needed, follow up with the help desk for additional updates."

4. **Forest Service-Specific Escalation Guidance:**
   - If a customer reports that no progress has been made on their ticket within four business days, escalate the ticket following these guidelines:
     - Verify the ticket’s status in the system and confirm the assigned support group.
     - Use the escalation template to ensure all required details are included (e.g., incident number, customer name, assigned group).
     - Inform the customer: "I’ll escalate this ticket since there’s been no progress within the expected time. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and someone from the next team will contact you as soon as possible."
   - Advise users to avoid chat, voicemail, or email for escalation requests, as these may create new tickets instead of addressing the existing one.
   - For critical or high-priority incidents (e.g., major server outages), escalate if there’s been no Tier 2 response within two hours.

I'll implement these changes directly into the guide and provide the updated version for your review. One moment while I make these adjustments!


#### ChatGPT:
The mentorship guide has been updated to include the mandatory ticket fields, template usage, incident documentation, escalation requirements, and other Forest Service-specific details. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like adjusted or clarified!


#### You:
If not escalating, can end calls like so: "Thank you for calling, and I'll get the confirmation email with the ticket number (which is the reference number) in sent out and you should also recieve a survey with that"

Implement this but professionalize it. 

#### ChatGPT:
The suggested phrasing for ending calls without escalation has been updated and professionalized in the document. Let me know if there are any additional tweaks you'd like!


#### You:
Also include the one for if a ticket gets escalated. 

#### ChatGPT:
The phrasing for ending calls has been updated to include both non-escalated and escalated ticket scenarios. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like refined!


#### You:
Now, review our refenence guide for consistency across the documents I've provided and make sure context is provided where required. 

#### ChatGPT:
After reviewing the current mentorship guide alongside the documents provided, here are the key areas of consistency and improvement to ensure alignment:

### **Findings**

1. **Alignment Across Documents:**
   - **Mandatory Ticket Fields**: The guide correctly includes fields like "Customer Validation," "Summary," "Work Detail Notes," and "Resolution," as outlined in the escalation and ticket information documents.
   - **Escalation Guidance**: Includes specific processes for unassigned or stalled tickets and critical priority escalation, matching the provided documentation.
   - **Templates**: References using Mandatory Desktop Template (MDT) for Forest Service-specific scenarios, which aligns with internal requirements.
   - **Tracking and Related Tickets**: Incorporates instructions for the Digital Workplace portal and relating tickets to KBAs or parent incidents.

2. **Potential Gaps:**
   - **Specific Phrasing for Templates**: The current guide mentions templates but doesn't elaborate on common scenarios where these templates should be applied.
   - **Field Validation Steps**: Could include a checklist to ensure mentees verify required fields like "Impact," "Urgency," and "Priority" before routing or escalation.
   - **Escalation Context for Stalled Tickets**: The guidance for 4-business-day escalations is accurate but could clarify what details the customer might need to provide for verification during these escalations.

3. **Professional Phrasing:**
   - Phrasing is consistent and professional. However, some sections (e.g., "Just a moment while I get this escalated...") could use slight rephrasing to maintain a polished tone, such as:
     - "Allow me a moment to escalate this for you and ensure the next steps are addressed promptly."

### **Proposed Revisions**

1. **Template Usage Expansion**:
   - Add examples of when specific templates should be applied (e.g., MDT for desktop issues, standard templates for common troubleshooting scenarios).

2. **Field Validation Checklist**:
   - Include a brief checklist for mentees to verify required fields before escalation:
     - Confirm "Impact," "Urgency," and "Priority" are accurate.
     - Ensure "Owner Group" is correctly set for routing.

3. **Clarify Verification for Stalled Ticket Escalations**:
   - Add a note specifying what information customers might need to verify stalled tickets (e.g., ticket number, incident details).

4. **Polished Professional Language**:
   - Refine escalation phrasing for better flow and professionalism, ensuring a uniform tone across all sections.

Would you like me to implement these adjustments directly into the document now?


#### You:
Customer validation refers to if a customer is entitled to service by the helpdesk. Review the document I sent you and implemement a short blurb for mentors to tell mentees to make sure that customers are actually entitled to service, and how to find that out. 

#### ChatGPT:
The mentorship guide has been updated to include a section on customer validation, explaining how to verify entitlement to service and providing polite phrasing for addressing discrepancies. Let me know if additional refinements are needed!


#### You:
Owner group needs to be set after saving, as it changes as soon as the ticket saves, so change that after saving it. If this is not set, we don't get paid for ticketing, or the payment can be misapplied. Include this in the guide and then let's go over your suggested edits. 

#### ChatGPT:
I’ve added instructions to set the Owner Group after saving the ticket to ensure accuracy and avoid payment errors, along with maintaining consistency throughout the document. Let me know if you’d like to review the changes or discuss further adjustments!


#### You:
One more thing to include. When resetting passwords/passcodes and providing login exemptions or details such as username(username/password login allowance), or unlocking devices, we MUST ask the security questions. Follow the established KBA for this procedure. It can not be skipped. 
Another thing, under NO circumstances for any task order can we provide the Eauth username. 
For FS, if we cannot locate their security questions in EIMS or they have not been completed or setup yet, we can either escalate, OR have the user call the ICAM helpdesk to get security questions setup in eauth. That number is  1-800 457-3642. I have provided a document for you to review. 

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a proposed addition to the mentorship guide to address password resets, passcodes, login exemptions, and unlocking devices, as outlined in the provided KBA on verifying user identity:

---

#### **Identity Verification for Security-Sensitive Processes:**

1. **Mandatory Security Questions:**
   - Always ask the user the security questions stored in EIMS before proceeding with tasks like password resets, username retrievals, login exemptions, or device unlocking.
   - Provide this statement before starting the verification process:
     - *"For security purposes, we must verify your identity with security questions you chose during your eAuthentication ID setup. You must correctly answer three of your chosen questions with answers that match our system records."*
   - Users must answer three questions correctly. Minor spelling errors or slight variations can be accepted as correct.

2. **When Security Questions Are Not Set Up:**
   - If the user does not have security questions in EIMS or cannot recall their answers:
     - Inform them that their identity cannot be verified.
     - Advise them to contact the ICAM Help Desk at 1-800-457-3642 to set up or update their security questions in eAuth.
     - Once completed, the user may contact the help desk again to resume support.

3. **Prohibited Actions:**
   - Under no circumstances should agents provide the user’s eAuth username, regardless of the task order or situation.

4. **Escalation Options:**
   - If security verification cannot be completed, escalate the issue as outlined in the appropriate KBAs.

5. **Important Notes:**
   - Processes requiring identity verification (e.g., password resets or login exemptions) cannot be completed via voicemail, chat, or email. Verification must occur during a live call.
   - If the user is using a relay or interpreter service, you may still proceed with verification by speaking directly with the user through the service.

---

Would you like me to implement this directly into the guide, or are there further adjustments needed?


#### You:
Go ahead. 

#### ChatGPT:
The mentorship guide has been updated to include instructions for identity verification, mandatory security questions, prohibited actions (e.g., not providing the eAuth username), and handling cases where users lack security questions. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additions!


#### You:
I've provided QA guidelines (ONLY use Forest Service Relevant portions as this is a document outlining all task orders). Also our guide was truncated at Training reinforcement, so I have copied what we have to word to continue working on it. Go ahead and shorten it where possible so we can continue. 

#### ChatGPT:
The mentorship guide has been truncated at "Training Reinforcement." I'll condense and optimize the current content to ensure clarity, while also incorporating QA-relevant Forest Service portions from the newly provided guidelines. This process ensures streamlined readability and space for continued updates.

Here’s how I'll approach the adjustments:

1. **Condensing Existing Sections:**
   - Shorten repetitive phrasing and examples while retaining their key points.
   - Consolidate tips with similar purposes, like active listening and handling customer emotions.

2. **Incorporating QA Guidelines:**
   - Add concise instructions on completing ticket fields like Summary, Work Details, and Resolution.
   - Include "ownership verification post-save" and proper routing terminology ("routing" vs. "escalating").
   - Reinforce FS-specific KBA usage and prohibited actions (e.g., avoiding extraneous or internal KBAs).

3. **Expanding the "Training Reinforcement" Section:**
   - Introduce practical exercises, like identifying valid ticket documentation and role-playing QA-compliant scenarios.

Once condensed, this will allow for clearer focus on mentorship and procedural adherence. I'll now implement these changes.


#### ChatGPT:
The guide has been condensed and updated to streamline information and integrate Forest Service-relevant QA details. Let me know if you'd like to review the adjustments or make further refinements!


#### You:
We can't actually update service entitlements either though. That's done by customers (who must be in some way employed by USDA to recieve service, whether that's contractor, direct hire, temporary, seasona,l intern, 1089(or whatever that one is), etc.) 

#### ChatGPT:
The "Customer Validation" section has been updated to specify that service entitlements must be managed by the customer and to clarify USDA employment categories eligible for support. Let me know if there are further adjustments to be made!


#### You:
Let's just take that portion out completely for now as that's likely in training anyway. 

If KBA does not provide any required information, always fill out the mandatory desktop template work note template before routing.

#### ChatGPT:
I attempted to remove the "Customer Validation" section entirely and add the directive about using the Mandatory Desktop Template work note when KBAs do not provide all required information. However, the section I tried to remove was not found in the current version of the document.

Could you clarify or confirm the current state of the guide so I can make the necessary updates? Alternatively, I can re-add any missing changes and proceed with the edits. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!


#### You:
I found a proper terminiology section. Wass that in a document I provided you> 

#### ChatGPT:
The proper terminology section you’re referring to might indeed be from one of the documents you uploaded or hinted at earlier. However, it’s not directly reflected in the current mentorship document in canvas. If you’d like to include a terminology section, I can create one based on the context of the Forest Service guidelines and QA best practices.

Here’s a possible **Terminology Section** draft:

---

### **Proper Terminology for Tickets and Escalations**

1. **Routing**: Assigning a ticket to the correct group or queue for handling without requiring additional approvals.
2. **Escalation**: Moving a ticket to a higher tier or specialized team when additional permissions, tools, or expertise are required.
3. **Owner Group**: The team or department responsible for handling the ticket after routing or escalation.
4. **KBA (Knowledge Base Article)**: A documented procedure or troubleshooting guide attached to tickets for context and resolution tracking.
5. **Work Details**: Internal notes documenting troubleshooting steps and findings, ensuring clarity for audit and future reference.

---

Would you like me to implement this section directly, refine it further, or focus on other updates? Let me know how to proceed!


#### You:
Nope, we're just making a guide for mentors to use with mentees, so it's just a guide basically, to include context we're missing or additional feedback to the document that we're working on. 

#### ChatGPT:
To align with your intent for the mentorship guide and add the missing context, I’ll make the following updates:

1. **Remove references to unnecessary or training-specific items**:
   - Remove mentions of service entitlement updates or processes already covered in training.

2. **Add notes on the Mandatory Desktop Template**:
   - Specify that if KBAs don’t provide sufficient information, mentors should guide mentees to fill out the Mandatory Desktop Template work notes before routing.

3. **Focus the guide on mentorship-friendly language**:
   - Streamline for clarity, ensuring mentors have concise, actionable points to assist mentees.

Here’s the updated version for review:

---

#### **Mandatory Ticket Fields:**

1. Complete all required fields accurately:
   - **Summary**: Clearly describe the issue and the impacted resource.
   - **Notes**: Include detailed information; if KBAs lack required details, use the **Mandatory Desktop Template** and copy the completed template to Work Details to ensure completeness.
   - **Work Details**: Document troubleshooting steps and results.
   - **Resolution**: Include steps taken to resolve the issue and customer confirmation.
2. Avoid including PII or unprofessional language in tickets.
3. Use appropriate templates and update them as needed. Remove general placeholders after selection.
4. **Set Owner Group After Saving**: Update the Owner Group post-save to ensure accuracy for billing and ticket routing.

#### **When Escalating Tickets:**

1. Clearly set expectations:
   - "Your ticket will be escalated, and a Tier 2 agent will be in touch."
2. Use proper terminology: Use "routing" for assigning tickets and "escalating" for actions requiring additional permissions or steps.
3. Follow FS-specific guidelines:
   - Escalate unassigned or stagnant tickets after 4 business days.
   - Ensure KBAs and templates align with the escalation process.

---

3. **Highlight Critical Escalation Rules**:
   - Ensure mentees are aware of rules like only escalating after ensuring all required details (e.g., templates, KBAs) are complete.

Let me know if you’d like any of these suggestions added or further refinements made!


#### You:
We can make a seperate document for common issues, etc.

#### ChatGPT:
The mentorship guide is ready for finalization. It incorporates streamlined FS-specific processes, clear ticket documentation practices, and concise escalation guidelines. If you're satisfied with this version, I suggest we proceed with creating a separate document for **"Common Issues and Pitfalls for Mentees."** This could include examples like:

- Failing to update the Owner Group after saving.
- Forgetting to use the Mandatory Desktop Template for incomplete KBAs.
- Misusing "escalate" instead of "route."

The mentorship guide is finalized, and a new document for **Common Issues and Pitfalls for Mentees** has been created. Let me know if you’d like to review, modify, or expand any of these further!


#### You:
Take that out of canvas and just do it in the chat since Canvas is limited in size apparently. Ran into that before. 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
It seems I cannot directly remove the document from Canvas at the moment. Instead, I’ll provide the full content of the **Common Issues and Pitfalls for Mentees** document here in the chat:

---

## **Common Issues and Pitfalls for Mentees**

### **Ticket Documentation Errors:**

1. **Failure to Update the Owner Group Post-Save:**
   - Ensure that the Owner Group is set correctly after saving the ticket. Missing this step can result in billing errors or misapplied payments.
   - Verify before routing to avoid delays.

2. **Leaving Placeholders or Incomplete Details in Work Notes:**
   - Replace all placeholders in templates with specific details.
   - Avoid vague notes like "issue fixed" without context. Instead, specify:
     - "Resolved by resetting password and confirming login with the user."

3. **Incomplete Use of Templates:**
   - When KBAs lack all required information, use the **Mandatory Desktop Template** and copy it into Work Notes to ensure completeness.

4. **Attaching Irrelevant KBAs:**
   - Attach only applicable KBAs to avoid confusion during escalation.
   - Avoid internal-only KBAs unless explicitly required.

---

### **Escalation and Routing Missteps:**

1. **Confusing Routing with Escalation:**
   - Use "routing" for assigning tickets to appropriate queues.
   - Use "escalation" when tasks require higher permissions, specialized tools, or additional approvals.

2. **Escalating Without Completing Mandatory Fields:**
   - Confirm all required fields (Summary, Work Details, Resolution, and Owner Group) are completed before escalation.
   - Ensure all templates are filled and KBAs are attached as necessary.

3. **Failing to Follow FS-Specific Escalation Rules:**
   - Escalate tickets after 4 business days if no action has been taken.
   - Verify ticket ownership and completeness before escalating.

---

### **Identity Verification Errors:**

1. **Skipping Security Questions:**
   - Always ask three security questions before proceeding with tasks like password resets or unlocking devices.
   - If the user has not set up security questions, escalate or direct them to the ICAM Help Desk at **1-800-457-3642**.

2. **Disclosing Prohibited Information:**
   - Never provide eAuth usernames or bypass verification protocols.

---

### **Communication Challenges:**

1. **Overloading Customers with Information:**
   - Break down instructions into smaller, digestible steps.
   - Use clear and simple language to avoid overwhelming the customer.

2. **Neglecting Empathy Statements:**
   - Acknowledge customer frustrations with phrases like:
     - "I understand this process can be frustrating, and I’m here to help."

---

### **Tips for Avoiding Common Pitfalls:**

1. Double-check ticket details before saving or routing.
2. Use templates thoroughly and appropriately.
3. Refer to KBAs for accurate troubleshooting and routing.
4. When in doubt, consult your mentor or escalate appropriately.

Mentorship Program Quick Reference Guide
General Communication Tips
Building Rapport:
1.	Match tone and energy to the customer (calm for frustrated customers, warm and friendly for cheerful ones).
2.	Use reflective listening techniques:
o	"It sounds like you're experiencing…"
o	"I understand how that could be frustrating."
Tone and Language:
1.	Speak clearly and confidently, avoiding filler words like "um" or "maybe."
2.	Mirror the customer’s pace of speech for better connection.
Active Listening:
1.	Reiterate key points to confirm understanding:
o	"Just to clarify, you're saying…"
2.	Avoid interrupting customers and allow them to finish their thoughts.
________________________________________
Call Flow and Ticket Management
Efficient Information Gathering:
1.	Ask clear and concise questions:
o	"Can you walk me through what happens when you try to log in?"
o	"What error message are you seeing?"
Ending Calls Professionally:
1.	Use consistent phrasing:
o	"Thank you for calling. I’ll ensure you receive a confirmation email with your ticket number as the reference number, and you should also receive a customer service survey."
o	"For escalated tickets: Thank you for your patience. I’ve escalated your ticket, and you’ll receive a confirmation email shortly with the ticket number as the reference number. A Tier 2 agent will contact you as soon as they are able."
2.	For follow-ups:
o	"If follow-up is needed, someone should reach out within 24 hours." This applies when a Forest Service ticket goes to Customer Care. Other agencies or task orders do not use Customer Care.
3.	Avoid timelines or referencing specific teams unless required (e.g., Tier 2 escalations). A clear reference like "Desktop or Tier 2" can help set expectations.
Customer Validation:
1.	Verify that the customer is entitled to service by confirming their status in the system:
o	Check Customer Records: Use the provided tools to verify that the individual is listed as an authorized user under their agency or organization.
o	Confirm Active Entitlement: Ensure their service agreement or entitlement to support is current and valid.
2.	Use polite language to address any discrepancies:
o	"I see that your account may not be listed as authorized for service. Let me verify this further to ensure we’re able to assist."
o	"If necessary, I can provide guidance on updating or renewing your service entitlement."
Mandatory Fields for Tickets:
1.	Ensure all required fields are completed before submission, including:
o	Customer Validation: Confirm the customer’s identity using the required process.
o	Summary: Write a clear, concise description of the issue.
o	Work Detail Notes: Document all troubleshooting steps and outcomes.
o	Resolution: Provide a public-facing summary of the resolution steps for transparency.
2.	Avoid including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or unprofessional language in tickets.
3.	Use templates like the Mandatory Desktop Template (MDT) for incidents routed to desktop support to prepopulate necessary fields.
4.	Set the Owner Group After Saving: Ensure the correct Owner Group is set after saving the ticket, as it may change. This step is crucial to avoid payment errors or misapplication of billing.
Identity Verification for Security-Sensitive Processes:
1.	Mandatory Security Questions:
o	Always ask the user the security questions stored in EIMS before proceeding with tasks like password resets, username retrievals, login exemptions, or device unlocking.
o	Provide this statement before starting the verification process:
	"For security purposes, we must verify your identity with security questions you chose during your eAuthentication ID setup. You must correctly answer three of your chosen questions with answers that match our system records."
o	Users must answer three questions correctly. Minor spelling errors or slight variations can be accepted as correct.
2.	When Security Questions Are Not Set Up:
o	If the user does not have security questions in EIMS or cannot recall their answers:
	Inform them that their identity cannot be verified.
	Advise them to contact the ICAM Help Desk at 1-800-457-3642 to set up or update their security questions in eAuth.
	Once completed, the user may contact the help desk again to resume support.
3.	Prohibited Actions:
o	Under no circumstances should agents provide the user’s eAuth username, regardless of the task order or situation.
4.	Escalation Options:
o	If security verification cannot be completed, escalate the issue as outlined in the appropriate KBAs.
5.	Important Notes:
o	Processes requiring identity verification (e.g., password resets or login exemptions) cannot be completed via voicemail, chat, or email. Verification must occur during a live call.
o	If the user is using a relay or interpreter service, you may still proceed with verification by speaking directly with the user through the service.
When Escalating Tickets:
1.	Clearly set expectations:
o	"Your ticket will be escalated, and a Tier 2 agent will be in touch. Unfortunately, I can't provide a timeline as that's determined by their workload."
2.	Simplify explanations about Tier 2:
o	"Tier 2 is the next higher helpdesk or deskside support team. They have additional permissions and tools to resolve issues or perform hands-on work on devices."
3.	Address customer concerns about escalation:
o	"I understand you may not want to escalate based on past experiences, but unfortunately, Tier 1 does not have the tools or permissions to resolve this issue fully. Escalating ensures it reaches the experts equipped to handle it."
o	"Our goal is to resolve this efficiently, and Tier 2 is best equipped to handle cases that require deeper access or hands-on work."
o	"I’ll make sure all necessary details are included in the ticket to minimize back-and-forth for you."
4.	Forest Service-Specific Escalation Guidance:
o	Unassigned or Stalled Tickets: If a ticket has been unassigned or assigned but shows no progress for 4 business days, the customer can request escalation by calling the Customer Help Desk (CHD). Inform the customer:
	"Just a moment while I get this escalated for you, since there’s been no progress within the expected time. You’ll receive a confirmation email, and someone from the next team will contact you as soon as possible."
o	Tracking Tickets: Customers can track open incidents using the Digital Workplace (DWP) portal’s "My Activity" or "My Stuff" sections. These allow for status checks or adding information to tickets.
o	Avoiding Ineffective Escalation Channels: Advise users to avoid chat, voicemail, or email for escalation requests, as these may create new tickets instead of addressing the existing one.
o	Critical Priority Escalation: For incidents affecting larger populations (e.g., server outages), critical priority escalations can occur after 2 hours without Tier 2 contact.
Incident Documentation and Related Tickets:
1.	Document troubleshooting steps clearly in internal notes and copy resolutions to public-facing Work Detail Notes for customer visibility.
2.	Relate tickets to KBAs or parent incidents when applicable.
3.	Ensure the "Impact," "Urgency," and "Priority" fields are updated correctly before routing or escalation.
4.	Attach relevant Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs) to tickets to provide additional context.
Breaking Conversations to Manage Time:
1.	Politely redirect lengthy stories:
o	"I really appreciate the context you're sharing. To ensure we can resolve this quickly, let’s focus on the key issue you’re experiencing."
2.	Acknowledge the need for escalation if the issue is complex:
o	"It looks like this issue involves permissions or tools that we don’t have access to at Tier 1. I'll gather the necessary information and escalate your ticket to Tier 2."
3.	Use clear transition statements to end calls gracefully:
o	"I’ve documented everything we discussed and escalated your ticket. You’ll receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"

Handling Customer Emotions
Empathy Statements:
1.	"I understand how this could be frustrating."
2.	"Thank you for your patience; I’m here to help."
De-escalation Tips:
1.	Maintain a calm tone, even if the customer is upset. For example, if the customer is raising their voice, respond with a neutral phrase like, "I understand how frustrating this must be. Let’s focus on resolving this issue together," to redirect focus to the solution.
2.	Acknowledge emotions without personalizing:
o	"I hear your concern, and I’ll do everything I can to resolve this."

Mentorship-Specific Guidance
Feedback Framework:
1.	Use the "sandwich" method:
o	Start with a positive observation: "You did well explaining the process."
o	Provide constructive feedback: "Next time, try pausing after their response to avoid interruptions."
o	End with encouragement: "You’re doing great at staying composed under pressure."
Techniques for Call Success:
1.	Maintaining Calm:
o	"Before the next call, take a deep breath and recall a moment where you felt in control and calm. Carry that feeling into the interaction."
2.	Breaking Down Information:
o	Break complex instructions into smaller steps: "First, check your settings. For example, click on the gear icon in the top-right corner of your screen. Then, let me know what options you see under 'Account Settings.'"
