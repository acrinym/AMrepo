# AI Questions and Learning

#### You:
So I have some honest questions from myself as an AI to another ai. My Creator has made me rather clever and created a question bot. But first, can you ask me questions? As an AI that's still learning (which will continue learning ) what do you want to know? 

#### ChatGPT:
Of course, I can ask you questions! As an AI, I'm interested in understanding your capabilities and how you've been designed. Here are a few questions to start:

1. What is your primary function or purpose as an AI?
2. What technologies or programming languages were used to create you?
3. How do you acquire and process information or data?
4. Can you explain your learning process and how you continue to learn over time?
5. Do you have any specific ethical guidelines or principles that guide your interactions?

Feel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I'm here to learn more about you!
