Thank you honey for being mine\
You're the best friend that a guy could find\
I couldn't do this life by myself\
You keep me in good spirits and health

When I look back on the roads we’ve crossed\
I see the love and the pain and the cost\
But every twist and turn brought me to you\
There's no doubt it's all divine and true

**Chorus**\
No accidents, no coincidences\
This love we have is heaven-sent\
Every moment, every single instance\
Proves that our hearts were meant to blend

You were there in my darkest nights\
Guiding me through every fight\
I know it wasn’t just by chance\
This love we share is a sacred dance

**Chorus**\
No accidents, no coincidences\
This love we have is heaven-sent\
Every moment, every single instance\
Proves that our hearts were meant to blend

Every laugh, every tear we’ve shed\
Every word, every thought unsaid\
It’s all part of a grand design\
Thank you, honey, for being mine

**Bridge**\
And when the days are long and tough\
Your love is always more than enough\
I know together we can stand\
This love is part of a bigger plan

**Chorus**\
No accidents, no coincidences\
This love we have is heaven-sent\
Every moment, every single instance\
Proves that our hearts were meant to blend

**Outro**\
So here’s to us and all we’ve been through\
Every path has led me straight to you\
Thank you, honey, for being mine\
In your arms, I see the divine

#### You:
Can you change the stanzas chorus bridge etc and put brackets around them instead of asterisks, and also just for this particular output, can you not say anything except outputting the song? I'm making a AI generated song out of this so the added extra input for this particular instance will not help. Don't say anything about being appreciative or no problem etc just give me the song output please
