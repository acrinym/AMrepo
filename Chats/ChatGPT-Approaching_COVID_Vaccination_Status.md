# Approaching COVID Vaccination Status.

#### You:
Hey GPT, when asking someone their vaccination status (covid vaccine), how do I even approach that topic to a potential new partner without scaring them away? It's a very important issue to me.  
I don't want to just say "hey, if you're vaccinated, I can't be around you"...because that's now how you make friends. 
How do I do it without being offensive or touching a really difficult debacle, since there is a lot of division one way or another? 

#### ChatGPT:
It's understandable that you want to approach the topic of COVID-19 vaccination status with care, as it can be a sensitive and divisive issue. Here are a few tips for discussing vaccination status with a potential new partner:

1. Start the conversation with empathy: It can be helpful to begin the conversation by acknowledging that discussing vaccination status can be a sensitive topic and expressing that you understand that some people may have concerns or hesitations. This can help set a tone of openness and respect.

2. Share your own vaccination status: One way to open up the conversation is to share your own vaccination status first. You could say something like, "I recently got vaccinated for COVID-19. Have you been vaccinated yet?" This can help create a dialogue and make it clear that you're interested in hearing their perspective.

3. Ask in a non-judgmental way: When asking about someone's vaccination status, it's important to avoid coming across as judgmental or confrontational. You could say something like, "I'm just curious, have you had a chance to get vaccinated for COVID-19 yet?" or "I'm trying to be cautious and protect myself and others. What are your thoughts on getting vaccinated?"

4. Listen to their perspective: Once you've asked about their vaccination status, it's important to listen to their perspective and concerns without judgment. You could say something like, "I understand that getting vaccinated is a personal decision, and everyone has their own reasons for making that choice. What are your thoughts on getting vaccinated?"

5. Respect their decision: Ultimately, it's important to respect their decision, even if it differs from your own. You could say something like, "I appreciate you sharing your thoughts with me. I think it's important that we all make the best decisions for ourselves and our communities."

Remember, approaching the topic of COVID-19 vaccination status can be tricky, but with empathy, respect, and an open mind, you can have a productive conversation with a potential new partner.

So, the way I talk as someone with Asperger's a lot of times makes it sound like I feel as if I know more than anyone about a subject, or I'm the authority, when in fact, usually I'm just trying to share information or caution with people about a topic. 

How do I talk about a subject, say - for example, GMO foods, to someone who knows nothing about it, but without sounding condescending or as if I feel like I know more than anyone about it? 


I tend to communicate badly when I talk about things I'm passionate about, when I haven't prepared a speech, and I just want to share... it comes out wrong, like "I think you should not....., because" or "you shouldn't ........because"....

How can I avoid talking as if I'm dismissive about the  things they think or beliefs they hold? 

#### ChatGPT:
As someone with Asperger's, it's important to be mindful of how your communication style may come across to others. Here are some tips on how to talk about a subject, like GMO foods, without sounding condescending:

1. Use "I" statements: Instead of saying things like "you should" or "you shouldn't", use "I" statements to share your own thoughts and beliefs. For example, instead of saying "You shouldn't eat GMO foods because they're bad for you", you could say "I choose not to eat GMO foods because I'm concerned about the potential health risks."

2. Be open-minded: When talking to someone who knows nothing about a subject, like GMO foods, be open-minded and avoid dismissing their thoughts or beliefs. Instead, try to understand their perspective and ask questions to learn more about their thoughts and feelings.

3. Share information in a non-judgmental way: When sharing information about a subject, like GMO foods, be sure to present it in a non-judgmental way. Stick to the facts and avoid using emotionally charged language.

4. Avoid using absolutes: Instead of saying things like "GMO foods are always bad for you", use more moderate language, such as "Some people choose not to eat GMO foods because of concerns about their health."

5. Practice active listening: When having a conversation about a subject, like GMO foods, it's important to practice active listening. This means listening to the other person without interrupting, asking questions to clarify their thoughts, and showing empathy and understanding.

Remember, communication is a two-way street. It's important to be mindful of how your communication style may be perceived by others, and to approach conversations with empathy and understanding. By using "I" statements, being open-minded, sharing information in a non-judgmental way, avoiding absolutes, and practicing active listening, you can have more productive conversations with those around you.
