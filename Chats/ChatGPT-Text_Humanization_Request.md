"Hey Stephen, I’ve been thinking about those times when we used to play *Astroneer* and *Borderlands* in the Peckham game group—those were some really awesome sessions! I still have *Borderlands*, and I recently started playing the latest update of *Astroneer* on a single-player creative and survival world. I really miss hanging out and catching up.

If you’re ever up for playing again, restarting the game group, or maybe even going out to eat sometime, I’d definitely love to hang out or play games together again. With CEC coming back and a lot of new employees starting, I bet we could get some new people interested in joining us.

I also remember those fun times we went out to watch movies with the friend group—there are a lot of good movies coming out that I really want to see, and I bet you’d be interested in them too if you haven’t already watched them. 

No pressure—just wanted to let you know I’ve been thinking about the fun times we had with our friend group, and I’d be up for doing that stuff again. You’re pretty awesome, and we share a lot of the same interests. I know you’re into tabletop games and DND, and I don’t have any experience with that, so maybe you could teach me sometime?

Hey Stephen,

I've been reminiscing about the good times we had playing *Astroneer* and *Borderlands* with the Peckham game group—those sessions were seriously fun! I still have *Borderlands*, and I recently started exploring the latest update of *Astroneer* on a single-player creative and survival world. I really miss our hangouts and catching up.

If you’re ever interested in playing again, restarting the game group, or even grabbing a bite to eat sometime, I’d be all in. With CEC coming back and a bunch of new employees joining, we might even get some fresh faces interested in joining us.

I also remember the great times we had going out to watch movies with the friend group—there are a bunch of good movies coming out now that I’d love to see, and I bet you’d be into them too if you haven’t already watched them.

No pressure, though—I just wanted to let you know that I’ve been thinking about those fun times with our group, and I’d be up for doing that stuff again. You’re pretty awesome, and we share a lot of the same interests. I know you’re into tabletop games and D\&D, and I haven’t dabbled in that yet, so maybe you could show me the ropes sometime?

Let me know if you need any more tweaks!


#### You:
Yeah I think I just want to take out the part about me complimenting him because I don't really know how that will be taken? We both got Asperger's and compliments, especially from someone who's somewhat underwhelmed by certain kinds of physical attention and someone who has had problems with relationships in the past of romantic kind may find that somewhat of a disingenuous thing.

#### ChatGPT:
I understand your concern. Here's the revised version of your message without the compliment:
