# New Teams Transition Timeline

#### You:
Why does teams say "58 days left" on the settings button? 

#### ChatGPT:
The "58 days left" message on the settings button in Microsoft Teams typically refers to the expiration of your Teams license or trial period. If you're using a free trial or a subscription-based version of Teams, this countdown indicates the time remaining before the trial ends or before your subscription requires renewal.

To clarify further:

- **Trial Version**: If you're on a trial version of Teams, the countdown reflects how many days remain before the trial expires, after which you may need to upgrade to a paid version.

#### You:
Nope, neither applies. This is an enterprise licensed New Teams. 

#### ChatGPT:
In the context of the **New Teams** experience with an enterprise license, the "58 days left" message likely refers to the **transition period** for users to switch from the **Classic Teams** experience to the **New Teams** interface.

Microsoft has been rolling out updates, including the "New Teams" experience, which is a faster, streamlined version of Teams. The countdown you're seeing could indicate how much time is left before Microsoft fully migrates users from the classic version to the new one, after which the older interface may no longer be available.

Here are some possibilities for why you're seeing this message:

1. **Transition Deadline**: Microsoft is phasing out the Classic Teams interface, and users are being given a set period (e.g., 58 days in your case) to switch over to the New Teams experience.
2. **Feature Adoption**: This could be a prompt for users to explore and adopt the new features of the updated Teams interface before the old version is deprecated.

If you're part of a managed enterprise setup, your IT department might also have additional specifics about the transition timeline and how the new Teams experience is being rolled out across your organization. It's worth checking with them to confirm if this applies.


#### You:
Ahh, I see. Will Classic Teams still work after that? Regardless if Microsoft removes the download or not, it's definitely floating around in places like my HDD. 

#### ChatGPT:
Once Microsoft fully phases out Classic Teams, its functionality will likely be discontinued, even if you have a local copy of the software on your hard drive. Here's why:

1. **Backend Services**: Microsoft Teams relies on cloud-based services and APIs that Microsoft controls. Even if you have the Classic Teams app installed locally, if the backend services it depends on are shut down or updated to support only New Teams, Classic Teams won't be able to connect and function properly.

2. **Security and Compatibility**: Microsoft typically stops supporting older versions of their apps for security reasons. If Classic Teams is no longer supported, you might encounter issues with compatibility, security vulnerabilities, and lack of access to new features or patches.

3. **Licensing Enforcement**: If your organization uses enterprise licensing, Microsoft can enforce restrictions on the usage of outdated versions through updates to their services, effectively blocking Classic Teams from connecting even if the app is still physically present.

So, while you might have a copy of Classic Teams on your HDD, it would probably stop working effectively once Microsoft fully switches over to the New Teams architecture. The best option would be to familiarize yourself with New Teams or check with your IT department to understand the exact timeline and how it will affect your organization.
