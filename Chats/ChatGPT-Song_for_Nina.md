**Verse 1**\
I saw the rain in your eyes, the day we walked alone,\
Through the streets of Lakeview, where a love had grown.\
Tiësto's melody played, the clock struck 10:35,\
And for a fleeting moment, our souls felt alive.

**Pre-Chorus**\
But broken hearts don’t heal in each other’s hands,\
We’re building castles on shifting sands.\
I held you together, though I was torn apart,\
Now I see the truth that was there from the start.

**Chorus**\
I didn’t want to leave, my love, I swear it’s true,\
Every step I take away still leads me back to you.\
But we both need the space where healing begins,\
To find ourselves whole, before we try again.

**Verse 2**\
You said you were broken, but beautiful inside,\
And I loved the way you never tried to hide.\
But the weight of my past made it hard to stand tall,\
I gave you my everything, though I had nothing at all.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Our dreams collided like waves on the shore,\
But my soul was searching for something more.\
Not someone to complete me, but someone to see,\
The man I’m becoming, who I’m meant to be.

**Chorus**\
I didn’t want to leave, my love, I swear it’s true,\
Every step I take away still leads me back to you.\
But we both need the space where healing begins,\
To find ourselves whole, before we try again.

**Bridge**\
I’ll always remember your touch, your care,\
The love in your heart, the way you were there.\
But sometimes love means letting go,\
To light our own paths, to let our hearts grow.

**Chorus**\
I didn’t want to leave, my love, I swear it’s true,\
Every step I take away still leads me back to you.\
But we both need the space where healing begins,\
To find ourselves whole, before we try again.

**Outro**\
So hold onto the beauty, the strength in your soul,\
This isn’t the end, it’s a step toward the whole.\
I’ll cherish the memories, the love we’ve known,\
And hope in the future, we’ll both have grown.
