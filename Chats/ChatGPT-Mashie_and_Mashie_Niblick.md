In golf, a **mashie** and a **mashie niblick** are terms from the pre-modern era of golf clubs, referring to specific types of irons:

1. **Mashie**: The mashie was a type of iron with a loft that is somewhat similar to a modern 5-iron or 6-iron. It was used for medium-range approach shots, typically for hitting the ball onto the green from distances where a player might need some lift but also wants to cover some distance.

2. **Mashie Niblick**: The mashie niblick had a higher loft than the mashie, similar to what we would now call a 7-iron or 8-iron. It was used for shorter approach shots or shots requiring a higher trajectory, such as getting the ball out of a tough spot or over an obstacle.

These clubs were part of the traditional set of golf clubs before the modern numbering system (1-iron, 2-iron, etc.) became standard.In golf, a **mashie** and a **mashie niblick** are terms from the pre-modern era of golf clubs, referring to specific types of irons:
