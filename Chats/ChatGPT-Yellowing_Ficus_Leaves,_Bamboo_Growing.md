# Yellowing Ficus Leaves, Bamboo Growing

#### You:
I'm in Michigan. I have this plant that appears to have rubbery leaves, sort of, and the trunk is seperated into several different trunks. It's just a tree from the store. One of the characteristics I'm noticing currently is that the leaves are turning yellow and are dying, with green spots that eventually disappear. Also, I really want to grow this black bamboo and moso bamboo from seed that I have. 

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like your rubbery-leaved plant might be a type of Ficus, like a Fiddle Leaf Fig or a Rubber Tree. The yellowing leaves could be a sign of a few different issues. Here’s a rundown of what might be going on and some tips to help your plant thrive:

### Possible Causes for Yellowing Leaves:

1. **Overwatering**: Ficus plants don't like their roots to sit in water. Make sure the soil is well-draining and that you let the top inch of soil dry out before watering again.
2. **Underwatering**: On the flip side, if the plant is too dry, the leaves can also turn yellow and fall off. Check the soil moisture regularly.
3. **Lighting Issues**: Ficus plants like bright, indirect light. Too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, while too little light can cause them to yellow and drop.
4. **Temperature and Humidity**: These plants prefer stable, warm temperatures and higher humidity. Cold drafts or dry air from heaters can stress the plant.
5. **Nutrient Deficiency**: Lack of essential nutrients can cause yellowing. Consider a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season.

### General Care Tips:

- **Watering**: Water thoroughly but infrequently. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.
- **Light**: Place in a spot with bright, indirect light.
- **Humidity**: Increase humidity with a humidifier or by placing a tray of water near the plant.
- **Fertilizing**: Feed with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).

### Growing Black Bamboo and Moso Bamboo from Seed:

1. **Soaking the Seeds**: Soak bamboo seeds in lukewarm water for 24 hours before planting to help with germination.
2. **Planting**: Fill seed trays or pots with a well-draining potting mix. Plant the seeds about 1/4 inch deep.
3. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mist the soil surface if it starts to dry out.
4. **Light and Temperature**: Provide bright, indirect light and maintain a warm temperature (around 70-85°F) for germination.
5. **Transplanting**: Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, transplant them into larger pots or directly into the ground if the weather is suitable.

### Additional Tips:

- **Patience**: Bamboo can be slow to germinate, sometimes taking a few weeks to a couple of months.
- **Protection**: If planting outdoors in Michigan, consider growing bamboo in pots so you can bring them indoors during the winter, as bamboo can be sensitive to cold temperatures.

#### You:
This specific bamboo is hardy. 

#### ChatGPT:
Got it! If your bamboo is hardy, you have a great advantage, especially in a Michigan climate where winters can be quite harsh. Here are some more tailored tips for growing hardy bamboo, specifically black bamboo and moso bamboo, from seed:

### Growing Hardy Bamboo from Seed:

1. **Seed Preparation**:
   - Soak the seeds in lukewarm water for 24 hours before planting to help with germination.

2. **Planting Seeds**:
   - Use a well-draining potting mix in seed trays or pots.
   - Plant the seeds about 1/4 inch deep.
   - Keep the soil consistently moist but avoid waterlogging.

3. **Light and Temperature**:
   - Provide bright, indirect light.
   - Maintain a warm temperature (70-85°F) for optimal germination.

4. **Germination Time**:
   - Be patient as bamboo seeds can take several weeks to a few months to germinate.

5. **Transplanting**:
   - Once seedlings are sturdy and have several leaves, transplant them into larger pots or directly into the ground.
   - Choose a location with well-draining soil and adequate sunlight (bamboo thrives in full sun to partial shade).

6. **Outdoor Planting**:
   - Ensure the site is protected from strong winds which can damage young bamboo.
   - Water regularly, especially during dry spells, until the plants are well-established.

### Caring for Hardy Bamboo:

1. **Watering**:
   - Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. Established bamboo can tolerate some drought but will grow best with regular watering.

2. **Mulching**:
   - Apply a layer of mulch around the base to help retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.

3. **Fertilizing**:
   - Fertilize in the spring with a balanced fertilizer or one higher in nitrogen to encourage strong growth.

4. **Pruning**:
   - Remove any dead or weak canes to promote new growth and maintain the health of the plant.

5. **Winter Care**:
   - Even though hardy, young bamboo can benefit from protection during its first few winters. Apply a thick layer of mulch around the base and consider wrapping with burlap if extremely cold temperatures are expected.

By following these steps, your hardy bamboo should thrive in Michigan's climate. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

How can I use my urine for fertilizer, because it's high(ish) in urea and nitrogen, and calcium. All things plants need, but it must be diluted of course. 

https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/urine-as-fertilizer/

#### ChatGPT:
Using urine as fertilizer can be an effective and sustainable practice due to its high urea, nitrogen, and calcium content. Here are some steps to do it safely:

1. **Dilution**: Dilute urine with water at a 10:1 ratio (10 parts water to 1 part urine) to prevent burning plants.
2. **Application**: Apply the diluted urine directly to the soil near the base of plants, avoiding contact with leaves.
3. **Storage**: If storing urine, let it sit for a couple of weeks in a covered container to minimize pathogen risk.
