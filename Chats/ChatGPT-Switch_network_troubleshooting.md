# Switch network troubleshooting

#### You:
I need to fix a "network not responding" Nintendo switch error. I can't connect to my home wifi. It won't delete and recreate it, I can't reboot the switch to get it to work.... Others connect just fine, and even a wifi extended connects to it just fine. 

#### ChatGPT:
The "network not responding" error on the Nintendo Switch can be frustrating, especially when other devices are connecting without issue. Here are some advanced troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. **Forget the Network and Reconnect:**
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Internet** > **Internet Settings**.
   - Select your network, choose **Forget Network**, then reconnect manually. If the issue persists and you can't delete the network, continue to the next steps.

2. **Change DNS Settings:**
   - Sometimes changing the DNS can resolve connectivity issues.
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Internet** > **Internet Settings**.
   - Select your network, choose **Change Settings**, and set **DNS Settings** to **Manual**.
   - Use **8.8.8.8** for the Primary DNS and **8.8.4.4** for the Secondary DNS (Google DNS), or try **1.1.1.1** and **1.0.0.1** (Cloudflare DNS).

3. **Power Cycle Your Router and Modem:**
   - Unplug your router and modem for about 30 seconds, then plug them back in.
   - Give it a few minutes to reconnect fully and try connecting the Switch again.

4. **Adjust Network Band Settings:**
   - If your router has dual bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), try connecting to the other band.
   - The Switch is often more stable on 2.4 GHz but can connect to both. Go to your router's settings and try temporarily disabling the 5 GHz network to see if that improves connectivity.

5. **Static IP Address:**
   - Assigning a static IP address can sometimes help with stubborn connectivity issues.
   - On the Switch, go to **System Settings** > **Internet** > **Internet Settings** and select your network.
   - Choose **Change Settings** > **IP Address Settings** > **Manual**.
   - Enter a static IP within your router’s range (e.g., if your router uses 192.168.1.x, set the IP to something like 192.168.1.150).
   - Set **Subnet Mask** to **255.255.255.0** and **Gateway** to your router's IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
   - Use the same DNS settings from Step 2.

6. **Move Closer to the Router and Reduce Interference:**
   - Physical distance and interference from walls or electronics can impact connectivity. Try connecting closer to the router, if possible.

7. **Update Router Firmware:**
   - Check if there’s a firmware update available for your router. Outdated firmware can sometimes cause compatibility issues with certain devices.

8. **Reset Network Settings on the Switch:**
   - If all else fails, you can reset your Switch’s network settings. Go to **System Settings** > **System** > **Formatting Options** > **Reset Cache**. This will remove all network configurations, so you'll need to reconnect to Wi-Fi networks manually afterward.

9. **Contact Nintendo Support:**
   - If none of these steps work, there may be a hardware issue with the Switch itself. Reaching out to Nintendo Support might be the next best step to see if they can diagnose it further.

#### You:
I can't set DNS without connecting it to the Internet? Wtf

#### ChatGPT:
Yeah, that does sound counterintuitive! Normally, you'd expect to change network settings, like DNS, without needing a current internet connection. Here’s how you might work around it:

1. **Manually Configure the Network**:
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Internet** > **Internet Settings**.
   - Select your network (even if it’s not connecting) and choose **Change Settings**.
   - Set **DNS Settings** to **Manual** here.
   - Enter your desired DNS addresses (like **8.8.8.8** and **8.8.4.4** for Google DNS).
   - Save and try reconnecting.

2. **Reset Network Settings on the Switch**:
   - If it’s still not letting you edit DNS without a connection, you can try resetting network configurations.
   - Go to **System Settings** > **System** > **Formatting Options** > **Reset Cache**.
   - This will clear out all saved network settings. Re-enter your Wi-Fi details and try setting DNS to **Manual** before you attempt to connect.

3. **Setup from Another Network Temporarily**:
   - If you can access a different Wi-Fi network, like a mobile hotspot, you might try connecting there first.
   - This will let you access the DNS settings and make any necessary tweaks.
   - Once connected, reconfigure the settings to your home Wi-Fi.

4. **Use a Router-Level DNS Setting**:
   - As a last resort, you can change the DNS directly on your router so that all devices connecting to it (including your Switch) will use the custom DNS.
   - Log into your router (typically via an IP like **192.168.1.1** or **192.168.0.1**) and look for DNS settings.
   - Set it to use Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1).
   - This should automatically update for all devices, including the Switch.

#### You:
No, I still can't get it to connect. I can't set the DNS before connecting it to a gal darn network

#### ChatGPT:
It’s definitely frustrating that the Switch forces a connection to set up certain network options. Here’s an alternative approach to try getting around this limitation:

### 1. **Create a Hotspot with Custom DNS on a Mobile Device**:

- On your mobile device (Android or iOS), set up a mobile hotspot with a custom DNS:
  - **iOS**: Go to **Settings** > **Personal Hotspot**, turn it on, and set the DNS on your device’s Wi-Fi settings.
  - **Android**: Go to **Network & Internet** > **Hotspot & tethering** > **Wi-Fi hotspot**, and look for any advanced settings to set the DNS manually (or try setting the DNS in your device’s own Wi-Fi settings).
- Connect the Switch to this mobile hotspot, which will use the custom DNS through your device.

### 2. **Configure DNS via a Laptop Hotspot**:

- If you have a laptop, you can create a Wi-Fi hotspot through your laptop with custom DNS settings:
  - **Windows**:
    1. Go to **Network & Internet Settings** > **Mobile Hotspot**.
    2. Turn on **Mobile Hotspot** and ensure **Share my Internet connection** is selected.
    3. Set the **DNS** to **Manual** by adjusting your network adapter’s DNS settings.
  - **Mac**:
    1. Go to **System Preferences** > **Sharing** > **Internet Sharing**.
    2. Enable **Internet Sharing**, choose the Wi-Fi interface, and set a custom DNS under **Network Preferences**.

### 3. **Temporarily Connect to a Different Network**:

- If neither mobile hotspot nor a laptop setup is available, try briefly connecting to any other Wi-Fi network (friend’s network, public Wi-Fi, etc.) just to get through the setup. Once the DNS settings are configured, you can then reconnect it to your home network.

These steps should help override the connection requirement and let you access DNS settings. Once configured, your Switch should ideally be able to reconnect with your home Wi-Fi using the new settings. Let me know how it goes!


#### You:
Other things can connect to it, and it wasn't a problem before. Hard resetting my router(as in keeping unplugged for 30 seconds) also doesn't fix it. The network *is* responding, but for some reason, the switch isn't connecting to it. It just happened all of a sudden, yet the nsx connects to other waps

#### ChatGPT:
Given that other devices connect fine to your Wi-Fi and your Switch connects to other access points (WAPs), it sounds like there may be a unique conflict between your Switch and your router's specific settings. Here are some targeted steps that may help resolve this:

### 1. **Toggle the Router's Security Settings**:

- Sometimes, a sudden update or glitch can cause compatibility issues with the encryption type.
- Log into your router settings (typically by typing its IP address, like 192.168.1.1, in a browser) and check the Wi-Fi security settings.
- If it’s set to **WPA3** or **WPA2/WPA3 Mixed Mode**, try switching to **WPA2-PSK (AES)** only, as some devices have trouble with newer WPA3 protocols.

### 2. **Change the Wi-Fi Channel**:

- Wi-Fi channels can sometimes create interference or connectivity issues.
- Set your router to a fixed channel (like 1, 6, or 11 on the 2.4 GHz band or 36, 40, 44 on the 5 GHz band) instead of “Auto.” This might resolve connectivity problems, especially if there’s recent interference on your router's current channel.

### 3. **Check MAC Filtering on the Router**:

- Some routers have a **MAC filtering** feature that restricts which devices can connect.
- Ensure MAC filtering is off or that your Switch’s MAC address is allowed.
- To find the MAC address on your Switch, go to **System Settings** > **Internet** > **Console Information**.

### 4. **Set Up a Separate SSID for the Switch**:

- Sometimes creating a dedicated SSID for the Switch can bypass conflicts with other network devices.
- Create a secondary network (SSID) just for the Switch, perhaps on the 2.4 GHz band only.
- You might also try disabling the **5 GHz band** temporarily to see if the Switch connects better on just the 2.4 GHz.

### 5. **Power Cycle the Switch with a Full Shutdown**:

- Sometimes a full reboot, not just a sleep mode restart, can resolve odd connection issues.
- Hold down the **Power button** on the Switch for about **12 seconds** until it fully shuts down, then turn it back on.

### 6. **Firmware Update Check**:

- Check if there’s a firmware update available for your router. Occasionally, routers get updates to improve device compatibility, which could help with sudden connectivity issues.

### 7. **Assign a Static IP to the Switch via Router Settings**:

- Go into the router’s DHCP settings and manually assign an IP address to the Switch using its MAC address.
- This often helps if there’s an IP conflict or lease issue preventing the Switch from connecting consistently.

If none of these work, the issue may stem from an unexpected compatibility quirk, and a router reset to factory settings might be the last resort to re-establish a stable connection with the Switch. Let me know if any of these steps help!


#### You:
I figured it out. It was paused on the spectrum WAP

#### ChatGPT:
Glad you found the issue! It makes sense now—pausing it on the Spectrum WAP would definitely block the connection for just that device. Those small settings are easy to overlook but can cause big headaches! If you run into any more network quirks, I’m here to help. Enjoy gaming on your Switch!
