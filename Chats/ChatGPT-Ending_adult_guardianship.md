# Ending adult guardianship

#### You:
Does an adult with a legal guardian(s) have the ability  to break out of the guardianship on their own or do the Guardians need to release the guarded? 

#### ChatGPT:
This depends on **jurisdiction** (country and state laws) and on **why** the guardianship exists in the first place.

### General U.S. Framework (most states)

- **Guardianship for Adults** (sometimes called *conservatorship*):
  - Usually established when a court determines someone cannot manage their personal affairs (due to disability, illness, or incapacity).
  - The guardian has legal authority to make decisions for the "ward" (the adult under guardianship).

---

### Can the Adult End the Guardianship Themselves?

- **The adult (ward) can petition the court** to terminate the guardianship.

- They do **not** need the guardian to release them voluntarily.

- However, they must show evidence of:
  - **Capacity regained** (they can manage their own personal and/or financial affairs), or
  - **That the guardianship is no longer necessary** or was improperly imposed.

- **Court Involvement Is Required**\
  Guardianship is a court order; only the court can terminate it, not the guardian alone (although the guardian can support or agree to termination, which often helps).

---

### If the Guardians Won’t Release Them

- The adult still has the **right to request a review**:
  - File a **petition to terminate or modify guardianship**.
  - Provide evidence (medical evaluations, personal testimony, witnesses).
  - The court may appoint an independent evaluator or guardian ad litem to review.

---

### Key Points

- **Adults under guardianship do have legal rights**—they can request a hearing.
- **The guardian cannot unilaterally keep them if the court finds they are competent**.
- In many states, periodic review of the guardianship is required, where the ward can speak up.

Do you want me to:

- **(A)** Give the exact steps to file for release in a typical U.S. state?
- **(B)** Explain how this changes if it’s a *voluntary* guardianship (where the person agreed initially)?
- **(C)** Show what evidence courts usually accept when deciding to end guardianship?\
  Or all three?This depends on **jurisdiction** (country and state laws) and on **why** the guardianship exists in the first place.

Michigan 

#### ChatGPT:
In **Michigan**, the law around guardianship of adults is governed by the **Estates and Protected Individuals Code (EPIC)**, primarily **MCL 700.5301 – 700.5319**.

## **Can a Legally Guarded Adult Get Out of Guardianship Without the Guardian’s Consent?**

**Yes.**

- The adult under guardianship (called the *ward*) **has the legal right to petition the probate court** to modify or terminate the guardianship at any time.
- The guardian’s permission is **not required**.
- Only the **probate court** can officially end a guardianship, because guardianship is a court order.

## **Steps to Terminate a Guardianship in Michigan**

1. **File a Petition to Terminate Guardianship**
   - Done with the **probate court** in the county where the guardianship was established.
   - Michigan has a standard form called **“Petition to Modify or Terminate Guardianship of an Adult” (PC 675)**.

2. **State Your Reason**
   - Usually:
     - You have regained capacity,
     - You can now manage your own affairs,
     - Or the guardian is unnecessary or inappropriate.

3. **Request a Hearing**
   - The court schedules a hearing where you (and possibly witnesses, doctors, or others) can present evidence.

4. **Court Evaluation**
   - Sometimes, the court may order an independent evaluation of your mental or physical condition.

5. **Judge’s Decision**
   - If the judge finds you are competent and can make responsible decisions, they **terminate or modify** the guardianship.

## **Key Rights in Michigan**

- **Right to Notice & Hearing**: You must be given notice of any hearings about your guardianship.
- **Right to an Attorney**: You can have an attorney, and if you can’t afford one, the court may appoint one.
- **Right to Present Evidence & Cross-Examine**: You can speak on your own behalf and challenge evidence against you.

---

## **Bottom Line**

- **You do not need your guardian’s consent** to leave guardianship.
- **You do need to petition the court** and show you are capable of managing your affairs.
- Guardianship continues until the court formally ends it.
