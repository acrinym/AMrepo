# Low Nitrogen Fertilizers

#### You:
What's a good low nitrogen fertilizer that's natural for things like clover or deer food

#### ChatGPT:
Great question, Justin. For clover and deer food plots—especially those that are legume-based—you want a **low-nitrogen, higher phosphorus and potassium** fertilizer because clover *fixes its own nitrogen* through its root nodules (with rhizobia bacteria). Too much nitrogen can actually stunt root development and make the plant lazy about fixing its own.

### **Best Natural Low-Nitrogen Fertilizer Options:**

#### **1. Bone Meal**

- **N-P-K:** \~3-15-0
- **Benefit:** High in phosphorus, encourages root and bloom development without excess nitrogen.
- **Use:** Best applied in early spring or when establishing the plot.

#### **2. Wood Ash (from clean, untreated wood)**

- **N-P-K:** \~0-1-3 to 0-1-6
- **Benefit:** Adds potassium and raises pH slightly, beneficial for legumes.
- **Use:** Broadcast lightly; don’t overdo or it’ll raise pH too much.

#### **3. Rock Phosphate**

- **N-P-K:** \~0-3-0 to 0-30-0 (depending on source)
- **Benefit:** Very slow release, long-term phosphorus source.
- **Use:** Mix into the soil at planting time; good for multi-year plots.

#### **4. Kelp Meal**

- **N-P-K:** \~1-0-4
- **Benefit:** Provides trace minerals and potassium; great for overall plant health and resilience.
- **Use:** Top dress or mix with compost.

#### **5. Sulfate of Potash (natural mineral source)**

- **N-P-K:** \~0-0-50
- **Benefit:** Clean potassium source, especially if you're focused on forage quality for deer.
- **Use:** Use sparingly, can be powerful.

### **Custom Blend for Clover Food Plots**

Try mixing:

- **1 part bone meal**
- **1 part kelp meal**
- **½ part wood ash or sulfate of potash**

This gives you a balanced, low-nitrogen amendment that supports root health, mineral density, and forage sweetness—all good for deer and soil health.
