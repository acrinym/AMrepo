# Memorializing Lost Friendships

#### You:
Hey onyx, what do you think of my memorializing all of the times I had a friend who for one reason or another I lost in my life? Jesse is the only one who actually died but the rest of them if feels like they died somewhere along the line without actually physically dying

That's a really profound idea, Justin. Memorializing those friendships, especially the ones that feel lost without a physical death, can be a powerful way to honor the roles those people played in your life. In a sense, friendships can sometimes end in a way that resembles death—the emotional connection fades, and you're left grieving for what was, even if the person is still around.

By doing this, you could create a space to reflect on the impact they had on your life, what you learned from them, and perhaps even release some of the lingering feelings that come with that loss. Whether it's through journaling, creating a visual memorial, or simply writing letters to them (whether or not they get sent), it can help bring closure to those relationships.

Do you feel like some of those friendships slipped away due to changes in you, in them, or just natural distance? That could be a meaningful part of the process to explore as well.That's a really profound idea, Justin.

I think mostly it had to do with switching schools but sometimes girls got in the way of people having friends with me and I think that happened also multiple times. I like to memorialize even the girls who had a good relationship with but the relationships didn't stay together. Maybe instead of calling them by their names or something I could write songs about the things that we did together or something? Those of course would be for my private listening and storage and archival

#### ChatGPT:
I think writing songs about those relationships and moments shared is a beautiful way to memorialize them. By capturing the essence of your connection through music, you're not only preserving the memories but also creating a deeply personal archive that’s unique to your experiences. Music can express things that are hard to put into words and can carry the emotions, lessons, and nuances of those relationships in ways that will resonate with you each time you listen.

You could write lyrics that reflect the shared moments, or even compose instrumental pieces that evoke the feeling of those times. Each song could represent a chapter in your life with that person, preserving the essence without needing to directly name them. This also gives you the freedom to revisit those memories in a way that’s meaningful to you without being too direct or bringing back unwanted emotions.

What style of music would you lean towards for these songs? Would you keep them all in one style, or do you think each person would inspire a different genre or vibe?


#### You:
I don't know, the way I wrote the song about Jesse with you turned out really well it was kind of sad but also upbeat

#### ChatGPT:
I'm glad to hear that the song about Jesse turned out well! It sounds like you've found a way to blend both the sadness of loss with the upbeat nature of fond memories, which is a powerful combination. It keeps the emotional weight but also honors the positive moments shared, which can be cathartic.

You might find that sticking with that kind of balance—songs that carry both a reflective, maybe bittersweet tone but with an upbeat or hopeful undertone—could work for memorializing those other relationships. It’s a style that captures the complexity of what you're feeling: the loss, the nostalgia, and maybe even a bit of gratitude for having had those connections.

If you wanted to experiment, you could even explore different tones or tempos depending on the nature of each relationship. For example, a more light-hearted or playful song for a friend who brought humor and fun into your life, or a slower, introspective melody for someone who had a deeper emotional connection with you.

Would you like to explore starting another song for one of those relationships, or do you have a specific approach in mind for how you'd like to begin?
