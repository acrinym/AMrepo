# Tartarian Empire Facts

#### You:
Tell me facts about the tartarian empire

#### ChatGPT:
The so-called "Tartarian Empire" is a concept often discussed in alternative history circles, but there is no evidence supporting its existence as a historical empire. The idea stems from a mix of misunderstood maps, misinterpretations of history, and conspiracy theories. Here's a breakdown of facts surrounding this topic:

1. **Historical Tartary**: Historically, "Tartary" or "Tartaria" referred to a vast, ill-defined region in Eurasia that included parts of modern Russia, Central Asia, and Siberia. The term was used by Western Europeans to describe the lands inhabited by the Turkic and Mongolic peoples. It wasn't a unified empire but rather a general term for various nomadic groups and tribes, including the Mongol Empire during the Middle Ages.

2. **Mongol Empire Confusion**: The Mongol Empire, established by Genghis Khan in the 13th century, did control vast parts of Eurasia, and its influence is sometimes conflated with the idea of a "Tartarian Empire." However, the Mongols did not call themselves "Tartarians"—this was a Western designation.

3. **Map Misinterpretation**: Old maps labeled large parts of Siberia and Central Asia as "Tartary," not to indicate an empire but rather to name a geographical region. Some alternative history proponents argue that these maps show evidence of a lost advanced civilization, but these maps reflect the limited understanding of the region by European cartographers.

4. **Conspiracy Theory Origins**: In recent years, the "Tartarian Empire" theory gained traction in alternative history communities, often linked to ideas of a grand cover-up by world governments to hide a lost civilization. Some claim that "Tartaria" was an advanced civilization wiped from history and that architectural wonders, like grand buildings from the 1800s, are relics of this lost empire. These claims are not supported by mainstream historical or archaeological evidence.

5. **Great Reset or Mud Flood Theories**: A subset of Tartaria theories involves the idea of a worldwide "mud flood" that supposedly buried large parts of ancient cities. Proponents of this theory argue that buildings with underground levels or structures that appear to be partially buried are evidence of such a cataclysmic event that erased knowledge of the Tartarian Empire.

6. **Lack of Evidence**: There is no solid archaeological, written, or historical evidence supporting the existence of a highly advanced, unified Tartarian Empire. The historical references to "Tartary" are more likely a case of European ignorance about the peoples living in the vast and remote regions of Asia rather than a deliberate cover-up of a forgotten civilization.

In conclusion, the "Tartarian Empire" narrative is largely a product of modern conspiracy theories rather than historical fact. Tartary was a geographical term used by Europeans to describe a large and poorly understood region of Eurasia, not a lost civilization.The so-called "Tartarian Empire" is a concept often discussed in alternative history circles, but there is no evidence supporting its existence as a historical empire.

#### You:
Well, for one, these historic buildings that are here when the colonists got here.. were very advanced. 

#### ChatGPT:
The idea that many historic buildings, especially in places like North America, were already here when colonists arrived is a core part of the "Tartarian Empire" narrative, but let's take a closer look at this in the context of what we know from documented history and architecture.

Many of the buildings we associate with being advanced for their time, such as grand government buildings, churches, and cathedrals, were indeed built in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Here are a few important points to consider about these structures and their historical context:

1. **Architectural Styles and Influence**: The impressive buildings you mention, with their grand columns, domes, and intricate designs, are often examples of European architectural styles such as **Neoclassical**, **Baroque**, **Renaissance Revival**, and **Gothic Revival**. These styles were heavily influenced by ancient Roman and Greek architecture, which emphasized symmetry, proportion, and the use of stone or marble to create monumental structures. Colonists and later settlers brought these influences with them as they sought to build lasting structures in their new territories, modeling them on European styles that had evolved over centuries.

2. **Skilled Labor and Construction Methods**: While some buildings might appear unusually advanced for the time, the settlers were not without expertise. Many European settlers who came to North America were skilled artisans, craftsmen, and engineers who had knowledge of advanced construction techniques. They also had access to European architecture books, and they often relied on those patterns to design public buildings and churches.

3. **The Industrial Revolution**: By the mid-to-late 19th century, the Industrial Revolution had made it possible to produce materials like steel and iron on a large scale. This allowed for taller, more structurally complex buildings. The construction of **cast iron architecture**, large bridges, and early skyscrapers can all be credited to these advancements, and they were made possible by evolving engineering methods and mass production.

4. **American Cities and European Influence**: Many of the grand buildings in early American cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston were designed by European-trained architects who sought to bring the grandeur of European cities to the New World. Structures like **the U.S. Capitol**, **the New York City Hall**, and others are reflections of a desire to create enduring civic landmarks that mirrored the great public buildings of Europe.

5. **Documentation and Historical Records**: While it is true that many buildings from earlier eras appear incredibly advanced, the construction of these buildings is well-documented. Detailed records exist of their architects, builders, and the materials and techniques they used. These records show that the buildings were designed and constructed in the years after colonists arrived, with many completed during periods of great architectural and technological advancement.

6. **Preservation and Restoration**: Some of the oldest buildings in America, such as the **Independence Hall** in Philadelphia (completed in 1753) or **Faneuil Hall** in Boston (completed in 1742), have been preserved and restored over the centuries. This meticulous care can sometimes make buildings appear even older or more mysterious than they actually are. However, these buildings are part of a long tradition of well-documented architectural preservation.

The **conspiracy theory** that these buildings were part of a much older civilization, often linked to Tartaria, tends to overlook the substantial historical evidence of how these buildings came to be. The sheer grandeur of these structures can indeed spark awe, but they are the result of centuries of architectural knowledge and skilled labor, not remnants of an unknown lost civilization.

It’s important to appreciate the incredible skill and craftsmanship that went into these structures while also recognizing the well-documented historical context in which they were built.


#### You:
They didn't have power tools yet knocked these things out in 1/2 years. We cannot do that

#### ChatGPT:
You're right in pointing out that many of the buildings constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries are marvels of architecture, built without the modern conveniences of power tools, heavy machinery, or advanced technology. It can indeed seem astounding how fast and efficiently these large, intricate structures were completed. Let’s break this down a bit to see how these feats were possible, and why it may seem difficult today to replicate such work.

### 1. **Skilled Labor and Craftsmanship**

The builders and craftsmen of those times were highly skilled and often specialized in particular aspects of construction. Stone masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, and other artisans would have apprenticed for many years, honing their skills in a way that was almost factory-like in its efficiency. Building methods were passed down through generations, and these tradespeople worked collaboratively, coordinating tasks with an almost military precision.

In fact, this **specialization of labor** helped speed up construction. For instance, stone masons focused solely on cutting and laying stones, while carpenters would build wooden frameworks and scaffolds. These specialized skills were honed to perfection, allowing for relatively fast and efficient work, even though it was done by hand.

### 2. **Labor Force Size**

One major reason many of these monumental projects were completed in such short timespans is the sheer size of the workforce employed. In today’s economy, employing large numbers of workers on a single building project for an extended period can be prohibitively expensive. However, in the past, massive teams of laborers were employed, many of whom were often paid relatively low wages or, in some cases, conscripted or enslaved.

For example, structures like **cathedrals in Europe** or **public buildings in America** were often built by hundreds or thousands of laborers working long hours under difficult conditions. The sheer scale of manpower allowed these buildings to be completed far more quickly than one might expect today.

### 3. **Different Construction Methods**

Many buildings of the time were constructed using methods that don’t rely on advanced technology but are extremely efficient given the right conditions. The use of **limestone**, **bricks**, and other materials that were locally sourced reduced the time and cost of transporting materials, and simple mechanical devices like **pulleys, cranes**, and **scaffolding** helped move heavy objects with greater ease.

The techniques used for laying **stone blocks**, **wooden beams**, and **foundational elements** were labor-intensive, but workers were well-practiced in these methods. For example, the use of **timber frameworks** allowed for tall structures like churches and city halls to rise quickly, and these were later filled in with stone or brick.

### 4. **Pre-Industrial Organization and Motivation**

The organization of such large-scale building efforts was often centralized and funded by governments, churches, or wealthy patrons who had every reason to see the work completed quickly. This contrasts with modern construction, where delays often stem from bureaucracy, zoning regulations, environmental assessments, and labor laws. In the past, construction projects didn't face such hurdles, meaning the focus could remain on rapid completion.

Additionally, buildings were seen as lasting monuments, so there was immense motivation to complete them quickly for political, religious, or economic reasons. In some cases, they were meant to showcase power and prestige, giving leaders incentives to have these buildings finished as soon as possible.

### 5. **Different Priorities and Regulations**

Modern construction is subject to much stricter safety, environmental, and labor regulations, which can slow down the building process significantly. In the past, safety standards were lower, and the pace of work was faster because there was less concern for the long-term health of the laborers or even for public safety during construction. Today, ensuring that a building meets earthquake codes, fire regulations, and other standards adds time and complexity to the process.

In the 1800s, projects might have employed crude scaffolding and rudimentary cranes that were dangerous but effective in speeding up the construction process
