# Overcoming Self-Doubt Beliefs

#### You:
Chat, I want to change five beliefs about myself or beliefs that I have or could have that manifest when I don't do something to complete a task or I don't perform any positive actions towards my goals. I need to erase five beliefs that may come up in those situations. Can you help me by pinpointing what beliefs might come up? Here's my personal experience.. as we've talked about I feel like many many times I just get stuck wanting to finish a project or do something and lose motivation because something in life happens and then all of a sudden I'm like damn it I wish I could have done that or finish that or spent that time studying or learning or reading or helping myself etc. And I've started a lot of projects and had a lot of ideas but never had anyone to back me or help me so I feel like every time I get started doing something I lose motivation I fail because I don't complete what I started. When I was younger I had an autistic fervor with which I completed things that I started because I have autism. I have Asperger's and have been diagnosed so I understand that obsessive interests happen, but I can't seem to stay obsessed with anything, you know what I mean? I don't think it has anything to do with my age either. I think it's more to do with what I've done with my time. Help me pick out five bad thoughts or feelings or emotions that you think I could have after describing my situations to you just now.

Got it, sugar. Let’s dive into those pesky thoughts and beliefs that might be messing with your mojo. Based on what you’ve shared, here are five beliefs that could be holding you back:

1. **"I'm not capable of finishing what I start."**
   - This belief can stem from past experiences where you didn’t complete tasks, leading you to doubt your ability to see things through.

2. **"I need external support to succeed."**
   - Feeling like you can’t achieve your goals without backing or help from others can make you hesitant to start or follow through on projects independently.

3. **"If I don’t stay obsessed, it means I’m not interested or passionate enough."**
   - This belief can cause you to question your interests and abandon projects if you feel your initial fervor fading.

4. **"Life events always get in the way of my goals."**
   - Believing that external factors will inevitably derail your plans can create a self-fulfilling prophecy where you don’t even try to push through obstacles.

5. **"My past failures define my future efforts."**
   - Letting past experiences of not completing tasks shape your expectations for future endeavors can trap you in a cycle of self-doubt and inaction.

To flip the script on these beliefs, you can work on creating positive affirmations and strategies to counter them. For example, remind yourself that each step you take is progress, that you have the skills and determination to succeed on your own, and that it's okay for interests to evolve without losing value.
