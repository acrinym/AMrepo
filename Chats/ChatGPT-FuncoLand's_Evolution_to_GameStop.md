# FuncoLand's Evolution to GameStop

#### You:
What happened to Funko land the video game retailer

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, FuncoLand! That place was a paradise for gamers back in the day. FuncoLand was a video game retailer that started in 1988 and quickly became a favorite spot for buying, selling, and trading video games. But like many things from the '90s, it didn't last forever.

In 2000, FuncoLand was acquired by GameStop's parent company, Barnes & Noble. They merged it with another company called Software Etc. The FuncoLand brand slowly faded away as these stores were rebranded to GameStop. So, essentially, FuncoLand got absorbed into what is now GameStop, which you probably know as the go-to place for video games and gaming merchandise.

So, while the FuncoLand name isn't around anymore, its legacy lives on through GameStop. It's like a gaming reincarnation story!Ah, FuncoLand! That place was a paradise for gamers back in the day.

But Funko land used to have all the old games and GameStop only has like the newest consoles. It really sucks compared to what used to be

#### ChatGPT:
Oh, I hear ya! FuncoLand was a treasure trove for retro gamers. You could find everything from NES classics to the latest releases, all in one place. It had that special charm where you could trade in your old games and hunt for those hard-to-find gems.

GameStop, on the other hand, shifted focus to newer consoles and games, which is a bummer for those of us who loved the old-school vibe. They do offer some retro games online and through special promotions, but it's just not the same as walking into a store and seeing shelves lined with all those classic titles.

It’s a real nostalgia trip thinking about it, and it’s a shame that kind of experience is harder to come by these days. The closest thing now might be specialty retro game stores or conventions, but they’re few and far between compared to the golden age of FuncoLand.


#### You:
I know about disc trader or is it CD trader

#### ChatGPT:
You're thinking of Disc Traders, which is a chain of stores that buy and sell used video games, movies, and other media. They are a bit like what FuncoLand used to be, offering a good selection of older games alongside more recent titles. They cater to the nostalgic crowd looking for classic games as well as those seeking deals on newer releases.

CD Trader is a bit different; it primarily focuses on buying and selling used CDs, DVDs, and records, though some locations might also have a selection of video games.

Both Disc Traders and CD Trader offer that thrill of hunting for bargains and finding hidden treasures, much like FuncoLand did back in the day. They help fill that gap left by the shift of GameStop's focus to newer games and consoles. If you have one nearby, it's definitely worth checking out for a bit of nostalgia and some great deals on games!

Wow that looks really cool. Apparently there was a Sega Genesis remake in the works by a private manufacturer but I'm not sure if that fell through or not, but it looked pretty cool

#### ChatGPT:
You're right! There is indeed a cool Sega Genesis remake in the works. Hyperkin has announced the "Mega 95," a handheld console that supports Sega Genesis and Mega Drive cartridges. This device features a 5-inch display, a six-button Genesis controller layout, and a dock that allows you to connect it to your TV, similar to the Nintendo Switch. It can switch between a 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio and has a battery life of around ten hours【23†source】【24†source】.

Additionally, Retro-Bit has been working on a new version of the Sega Nomad, which also allows for playing Genesis games on the go. This remake aims to improve on the original's shortcomings, such as poor battery life and screen quality【25†source】.

Both of these projects bring a modern twist to classic Sega hardware, offering a new way for fans to enjoy their favorite retro games. Keep an eye on Hyperkin and Retro-Bit's official channels for updates on release dates and pricing.
