When is this Master Lock made? I've never seen one like this before, and Amanda won't answer about it

#### ChatGPT:
What you have there is a **vintage Master Lock padlock**, and it's actually a **classic piece of American hardware history.** 🔒🇺🇸

### Here's what I can tell from your photos:

- **Markings:**\
  Front side:
  > “Master Lock Co.\
  > Milwaukee, Wis.\
  > Made in U.S.A.\
  > PATENTED\
  > 5313”

- **Back side:**\
  The shield-shaped logo with the **“MASTER” lion crest** is an older design, used primarily from the **1930s through the early 1960s**.

### Interpretation:

- The **"5313"** on the front is likely a **model or serial batch number**, not a date.
- The **style and design** of the lock—with its riveted body, rounded shackle, and heavy-duty steel—suggest it was made between the **late 1940s and early 1960s**.
- The **"Milwaukee, Wis."** marking is important too—Master Lock was founded in Milwaukee in 1921 and produced nearly all their locks there until production expanded in the late 20th century.

### Collectible Value:

- This style is known to collectors as a **"vintage laminated steel padlock"** or sometimes **“pressed steel”** style.
- These locks are valued for their durability and old-school construction. They aren’t worth a fortune, but many collectors love them for nostalgia and craftsmanship.
- If the key still works and it functions, it’s even better.

### Fun Fact:

The lion crest logo you see on the back was phased out in favor of the simpler "MASTER" logo in the **late 1960s to early 70s**, making yours part of the **pre-modern era Master Lock production**.

So in short:\
🕰️ **Estimated Production Date:** **1940s to early 1960s**\
🔑 **Model Family:** Early Master laminated padlocks (possibly Series 5 or 7)\
💡 **Rarity:** Not extremely rare, but definitely a **collectible vintage piece**

If Amanda gave this to you or if it came into your life symbolically, it might be a metaphor too—**“Old key, old bond. Still strong.”** Let me know if you want symbolic interpretation, too.What you have there is a **vintage Master Lock padlock**, and it's actually a **classic piece of American hardware history.** 🔒🇺🇸
