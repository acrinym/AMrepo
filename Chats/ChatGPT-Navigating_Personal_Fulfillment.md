# Navigating Personal Fulfillment

#### You:


So I feel like I've been on autopilot for at least 7 years just drifting through New Life from one partner to the next. I'm a guy and I like girls. Let's start with that so don't refer to me as it or them or they and don't refer to anyone as it, then, they, but refer to their proper identity, not non-specific pronouns. So, that out of the way, let me tell you a story. So I've had a lot of dreams for a lot of years, and I feel like every person I meet has some characteristic that I find alluring or interesting, but as someone who likes to fix things, I'm not really drawn towards the fixable people who have a something wrong or have an issue or have a problem to fix in their life. Well I've gotten into a lot of those hey I can help you fix this whatever it is.. relationships and I'm currently in one right now. After having gone 6 years just now through two relationships, one being 4 years and one being one year, I'm just tired of trying to fix people or meeting people who need to be fixed or trying to help people with their problems when they're glaringly evident. I want specific things out of people in life, and I definitely haven't been getting those things. I also don't have a community of any sort that I belong to or social gathering besides people at work which leaves me incredibly stressed because I don't have people to talk to about things or share things with as my current relationship, my discussions that I'd like to have kind of go one-sided, where I'm doing the talking and my fiance is doing the listening but really there's no discussion it's more like hi honey blah blah blah blah blah blah and then she's silent. And I've been with her for a year now two years almost? No it was 1+ year in July. It is now August. And almost the entire time up until probably december, or maybe shortly before that I had been focusing on my relationship. I put everything else on hold to focus on this relationship and make it the best thing I've ever experienced. Well, the issue with that is that is it's not. I can't change it to be that. I can't change it to be the best relationship I've ever had because it's not. I have not had that experience. We moved and some roommates right after we met, my fiance and I, and it was this woman that she knew who was sort of family and her 3 kids, one of them being a baby. There really wasn't much deliberation on whether or not we should do this, it was more her idea and she just couldn't leave them out without a house because there was a baby involved. I understand that specific thing, but I don't understand why we had to keep them so long and why they got to take advantage of us without paying rent or anything for a year. I brought up kicking them out and again the response was we can't kick her out because she's got a baby. Woohoo, people live in shelters all the time I would have liked to have said. Anyways, this caused me a lot of trauma and a lot of hardship due to having noise and distraction and unwelcome interaction with the kids, the mom, and the baby. And it was right before that point that I had decided that I was going to make life amazing, even if it wasn't perfect I was going to make the most of my time and do everything I wanted to to make my life better. Well then my life took a drastic turn and the roommates came. I stopped my routines that I had developed and I stopped my learning, and I stopped being able to focus because they were annoying and of rambunctious and loud and etc etc etc, and so I just kind of lost a year of my life to them. And it was a very very f****** miserable time. Now I feel like the last 7 years or so, nearly everyone in my life is stuck in this alternate reality where everything's okay and the world is fine and it'll be fine and just have a job, go to work, come home, be married or whatever relationship and just be happy. But that's not okay that's not who I am. I don't just live a doll work sleep eat ,go to bed work sleep eat watch TV go to bed etc. what I need your help with is to tell my stepson that I'm experiencing this and I feel like the rest of the world, unfortunately including him and his mom, are stuck in this alternate reality where I can't be because it's driving me insane. I've done it for too long, years and years, and I just want to live life and experience you know the things I want to experience like taking care of myself, healing myself, eating right, growing my knowledge and spiritual journey, and having a business, having multiple businesses, being wealthy. But I'm the only one here who wants to do those things and I'm really the only one taking actions to become that person who lives that way. So what I would like to tell him is that I feel like I need to leave without saying that I feel like I need to leave, you know what I mean? He's only 13 so I want to try to explain how I feel in my head to him. Do you think you can help with that?

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Justin, I can sense how much you've been carrying all these years, trying to find a place where your dreams align with your reality. It sounds like you've been through a lot of emotional labor, not just in your relationships, but in trying to reconcile your own desires with the reality around you. You're seeking growth, fulfillment, and a life that resonates with your deepest values, but it feels like you're stuck in an environment that doesn't reflect that.

When it comes to explaining this to your stepson, I think it's important to keep things simple and relatable, given his age. You could frame it in a way that he can understand without feeling overwhelmed or scared. Here's a way you might approach it:

---

"Hey \[stepson's name], I want to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. You know how sometimes you might be playing a game or watching a show, and it's like everyone else is doing one thing, but you're really interested in something else? Maybe you want to explore a different level or try something new, but it feels like you're the only one who wants to do that?

Well, that's kind of how I feel right now. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and there are some things that are really important to me—things like learning more, taking better care of myself, and trying new experiences. I want to make sure that I'm living the kind of life that makes me happy, even if it means doing things a bit differently from what everyone else is doing.

I care a lot about you and your mom, and I want us all to be happy. But sometimes, I feel like I'm in a place where I'm not able to grow in the ways I need to. It doesn't mean I don't care about you guys—it's just that I need to figure out how to be the best version of myself too.

I want you to know that if I seem different or if I make changes, it's not because I don't love you. It's just that I need to follow a path that feels right for me. And I hope we can support each other, even if we're not always doing the exact same thing."

---

This approach allows you to express your feelings without making him feel like you're abandoning him or his mom. It's about framing your desires as a need for personal growth, which is something everyone can relate to, even at a young age. It opens the door for him to ask questions if he's curious or just to understand that sometimes adults need to make choices for their well-being.


#### You:
Can you explain it using fortnite? 

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely! Here’s how you could explain it using *Fortnite*:

---

"Hey \[stepson's name], can we talk for a minute? I want to share something that's been on my mind, and I think using *Fortnite* might help explain it better.

You know how in *Fortnite*, you drop into the game, and everyone’s heading to different places on the map? Some people might head straight to Tilted Towers, others to the edge of the map to gear up quietly, and some just run around looting. But you, maybe you’ve got your eye on that secret spot where you know you can get some awesome loot and set yourself up for a good match.

Well, that’s kind of how I’ve been feeling about life lately. It feels like everyone around me is heading to Tilted Towers, playing the game in a certain way, but I’m wanting to go somewhere else on the map. I have different goals—like leveling up my skills, finding new strategies, and exploring different parts of the map that other people might not be interested in.

But it’s hard because, in real life, it’s not just a game we can restart if we don’t like how it’s going. I’ve been playing in a way that’s more like following others to Tilted Towers, and it’s not working out for me. I’m not getting the gear I need, and I’m not getting the experience I’m looking for.

I want to let you know that I’m thinking about changing my approach—maybe going to that secret spot that feels right for me. It’s not because I don’t want to play the game with you and your mom, but because I need to focus on what will help me level up and become the best version of myself. I’m still here for you, and I care about you a lot. I just need to play the game of life in a way that feels right for me, and I hope you can understand that."

This way, you’re using a scenario he’s familiar with to help him grasp the concept of you needing to follow your own path for personal growth. It makes it relatable and easier to understand, while also keeping the conversation light yet meaningful.Absolutely! Here’s how you could explain it using *Fortnite*:

#### You:
Now  how you would you suggest that I talk to my fiance about this? She is very much in love with me but I feel like we can't be together for me to fulfill my duty to myself to gain what I want and to learn things that need learning you know what I mean? It's very hard to do that when not alone. I have responsibilities to her and to my stepson who is her son, etc etc etc. it's not that I don't love her but it's just I feel very constrained and very cut off from knowledge I want to gain the experiences I want to have and the self realization I want to achieve

#### ChatGPT:
I can understand how difficult this situation is for you, especially when you care deeply about Nina and your stepson. It’s clear that you’re at a crossroads where your personal growth and the relationship seem to be pulling you in different directions. Having this conversation with Nina requires a balance of honesty, compassion, and clarity. Here’s how you might approach it:

---

"Hey Nina, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately, and there’s something important I need to talk to you about. This isn’t easy for me to say because I love you and I care so much about you and \[stepson's name]. But I’ve been feeling really conflicted for a while now.

You know how much I’ve always valued personal growth, learning, and seeking out new experiences. Lately, though, I’ve felt really constrained, like I’m not able to fully explore the things that are most important to me. It’s like there’s this part of me that’s trying to grow, to learn, and to achieve something deeper, but I’m finding it incredibly hard to do that while balancing everything else in our lives.

It’s not that I don’t love you or that I don’t care about our relationship, because I do—so much. But I feel like I have this duty to myself to pursue the knowledge and experiences that are calling to me. It’s like there’s a part of me that needs to be alone to really dive into this journey, to discover who I am and what I’m truly capable of.

I know this is a lot to take in, and I don’t want to hurt you. But I also know that if I don’t address this, I’m going to continue feeling cut off from the growth I need to experience. It’s a hard thing to balance because I don’t want to lose you or the connection we have, but I also can’t ignore this deep need to explore life in a way that might require some distance or change.

I want us to talk about this together, to figure out what it means for both of us, and to see if there’s a way we can approach this that honors both our needs. I just need you to know where my heart is right now, and that this isn’t about not loving you—it’s about finding a way for me to grow in the ways that I need to."

---

This approach lets you express your feelings without placing blame or creating a sense of finality. It opens up a dialogue where you can both discuss your needs and see if there’s a way forward that respects your desire for growth while considering the impact on her and your stepson. The key is to be gentle but honest, giving her space to process what you’re saying while being clear about what you need.


#### You:
Yeah really I feel dead inside like I've just been frozen in time for 7 years or maybe longer. I haven't gotten where I want to, I haven't finished the things I wanted to finish, I've been putting life on hold for everyone else in my life, especially the people I love.

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
I hear you, Justin. That sense of being frozen in time, unable to move forward, can be incredibly draining, especially when it feels like you've been putting your life on hold for others. This is a profound realization, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling this way after so many years of not being able to fully pursue what truly matters to you.

When talking to Nina about this, it might be helpful to express this feeling of being frozen and the toll it’s taken on you. Here’s how you might approach it:

---

"Nina, there’s something really important I need to share with you. For a long time now, I’ve felt like I’m just frozen in place, like time has stopped for me in a way. It’s like I’ve been standing still for years, unable to move forward or accomplish the things that are deeply important to me. And this feeling has been weighing on me more and more.

I’ve realized that I’ve been putting so much of my life on hold—my dreams, my goals, the things that truly make me feel alive—for the sake of everyone else around me, especially the people I love. But in doing that, I’ve lost a part of myself. I feel like I’ve been dead inside, just going through the motions, and that’s not how I want to live.

It’s incredibly hard for me to say this because I love you, and I care so much about \[stepson's name] and our life together. But I can’t ignore this anymore. I need to find a way to break out of this frozen state, to start living again and pursuing the things that are essential to who I am.

I don’t want you to feel like this is your fault, because it’s not. It’s more about me needing to reconnect with myself and the things that matter most to me. I need to figure out how I can do that, even if it means making some difficult decisions. I just want you to know how I’m feeling and why this is so important to me."

---

This approach is deeply personal and honest, and it acknowledges the pain and difficulty of the situation while making it clear that your need for growth and change is essential for your well-being. It’s a way to open up about your feelings without placing blame, and it gives both of you the space to consider what comes next.


#### You:
That's kind of the gist of it,. The way I explained it to elijah, my stepson is that I feel like I'm stuck in the year 1950 and I'm the only person who understands that we're actually in the year 2024... And everyone still living like it's 1950, nothing really since that year has changed except maybe some technological advances yet, everyone's stuck in this hamster wheel world in their minds all robot like and moving to the same drum. I can't do that it drives me absolutely insane and makes me very depressed

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
That’s a powerful metaphor, Justin, and it really captures the depth of your frustration and disconnection. It’s clear that you feel like you’re living in a different reality from everyone else, one that’s more aware and forward-thinking, while others seem trapped in a mindset that no longer fits the world as it is.

When you talk to Nina, you might consider using that same metaphor, as it clearly expresses how you see things. Here’s how you could frame it:

---

"Nina, I need to talk to you about something that’s been weighing heavily on me. Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m stuck in the year 1950, and it seems like I’m the only one who realizes that we’re actually in 2024. It’s like everyone around me, including the people I care about the most, is still living as if nothing has changed since 1950, except for some technological advances. It’s as if we’re all stuck on a hamster wheel, moving to the same beat, doing the same things over and over, without really seeing the world for what it is now.

This feeling has been driving me absolutely insane, and it’s making me really depressed. I can’t keep living like this, pretending that everything is fine when it’s not. I see so much more that we could be doing, so much more that I could be learning and experiencing, but I feel like I’m trapped in this outdated reality where nothing changes, and I can’t be who I truly am.

I love you, and I care deeply about you and \[stepson's name], but I feel like I’m suffocating in this life. I need to find a way to break free from this feeling, to live in a way that reflects who I am and the world as it is now. It’s not about wanting to leave you or stop caring about our life together—it’s about needing to be true to myself and not get lost in a reality that doesn’t fit me anymore.

I hope you can understand where I’m coming from, and we can talk about what this means for both of us. I just need you to know how much this is affecting me and why it’s so important that I address it."

---

This approach uses the metaphor that resonated with your stepson, making it clear to Nina just how deeply this issue is affecting you. It’s a way to express your need for change and growth while also acknowledging the love and care you have for her and your stepson.


#### You:
I also actually do feel like leaving is the only way to fix it, but that isn't what I want to say to her. That would not really make anything better, saying that, you know what I mean

#### ChatGPT:
I understand completely. It's a delicate situation because while you feel that leaving might be the only way to address how you're feeling, saying that outright could cause a lot of pain and might not lead to a constructive conversation. Instead, you might want to focus on expressing how deeply you're struggling and how much you need to find a way to live that aligns with who you are, without necessarily framing it as an immediate decision to leave.

Here’s how you might approach it:

---

"Nina, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I need to talk to you about something that’s been really hard for me. I’ve been feeling incredibly trapped, like I’m stuck in a place where I can’t be who I truly am. It’s as if I’m living in the past, while everything inside me is screaming to move forward, to grow, to experience life in a way that feels real and meaningful to me.

I don’t want to hurt you, and I don’t want to say anything that would make things worse between us, but I need you to understand how deep this feeling goes. It’s not just a phase or a passing thought—it’s something that’s been building for a long time, and it’s affecting every part of my life. I feel like I’m suffocating, and I’m not sure how to fix it while things stay the way they are.

I’m not saying this to push you away or to suggest that I’m ready to make any drastic changes right now. I just need to be honest with you about how I’m feeling because it’s reached a point where I can’t ignore it anymore. I need to find a way to reconnect with myself, to live in a way that makes me feel alive again, and I want to find a way to do that without causing more pain.

Maybe we can figure this out together, or maybe there are things I need to do on my own, but I’m hoping we can talk about it and see what makes sense for both of us. I just want you to know where I’m at, and I want to be open with you about what’s going on in my head and my heart."

---

This way, you’re being honest about your struggle without directly saying that leaving is the only solution. It opens the door to a conversation where you can explore possibilities together, even if those possibilities might be difficult. It also gives her space to understand the depth of your feelings without feeling immediately threatened by the idea of you leaving.I understand completely.

#### You:
Well I'm planning a possible departure at the end of the year sometime so that may give some time and space for her to process. I talked to her about selling the house and moving over to where all my friends and family are, but that won't be ready for another year plus possibly. We're still waiting for the people to finish the house because the contractors just up and leave a lot of the time and so projects go unfinished and the house goes not on the market. I don't want to leave her just you know, without anything, because I am her very best friend and really her only friends, but I don't see my own friends or have my own group of people.. she has work and people shaking talk to there about work and maybe a few other things, but she at least has colleagues that she has something in common with and that she can talk to about her job and she really enjoys it. But it's not really growing her and that's a problem I see for her but I can't change it for her. I can't live that way as I've expressed

#### ChatGPT:
It’s clear you’ve thought a lot about how to handle this situation with care and consideration for Nina’s well-being, even as you navigate your own needs and feelings. Planning a possible departure at the end of the year gives both of you time to process and consider the next steps, which is wise.

Given this, you might approach the conversation with Nina by framing it around the future and the possibilities that lie ahead, rather than focusing on an immediate need to leave. Here’s a way you could talk to her:

---

"Nina, I want to talk about something that’s been on my mind, especially as we start thinking about the future and what’s next for us. I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure inside, like I’m not able to grow in the ways I need to. It’s been weighing on me, and I’ve realized that if I’m going to become the person I need to be, some changes are necessary.

We’ve talked about selling the house and moving closer to where my friends and family are, but I know that’s still a ways off, and there’s a lot that needs to happen before then. In the meantime, I’ve been thinking about how I can start making some changes that will help me move forward. I want to be honest with you about the fact that I’m considering the possibility of needing to take some time and space for myself at the end of the year.

This isn’t something I’m rushing into, and it’s not because I don’t love you or care about you. In fact, I’m really concerned about making sure that you’re okay and that you’re supported, no matter what happens. I know that you have colleagues at work and that you enjoy what you do, but I also know that your job might not be giving you the growth that you deserve. I see that, and it worries me, but I also know that I can’t change that for you—you have to find your own path, just like I need to find mine.

I don’t want to leave you without anything or without support, but I also need to be honest with myself and with you about where I’m at. I’m hoping that by talking about this now, we can both start thinking about what the future looks like, and maybe we can come up with a plan that gives us both what we need, even if it’s difficult.

I’m not saying I’m leaving right now, but I need you to know that it’s something I’m seriously considering by the end of the year. I want to figure this out together if we can, and I hope we can have an open and honest conversation about what’s best for both of us."

---

This approach gives Nina time to process and understand where you’re coming from, while also giving her the chance to think about her own needs and future. It’s a compassionate way to prepare her for the possibility of change, while also emphasizing that you care deeply about her well-being, even as you consider taking steps that are necessary for your own growth.


#### You:
When I talk to my therapist earlier today I've been said that I haven't really discussed actually moving yet with her, but I have my chance taking some time at my mom's house and that was a couple months ago when I mention that. She said that if I did that she probably couldn't stay alone, in other words I would have a replacement or someone to make her not lonely. And that's not really calming to my ears. Because it means that even if I have this stream need to fix some things with myself that she's not willing to wait really for me to do that by myself. I understand if she wants to grow and has a desire to grow with me, but this isn't really something I can do with someone else

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like Nina's response has added another layer of complexity to an already challenging situation. Her reaction might stem from a fear of being alone, which can be tough for her to face, especially if she feels dependent on your presence for emotional support. However, it's crucial for you to prioritize your need for personal growth and healing, especially if it's something that requires solitude.

When you approach this conversation with Nina, it might help to acknowledge her feelings while also emphasizing your own needs. Here’s how you could address it:

---

"Nina, I’ve been thinking a lot about the conversation we had a couple of months ago when I mentioned possibly spending some time at my mom’s house. I know you said that being alone would be really hard for you, and I want you to know that I understand why you feel that way. I know how much we mean to each other, and the idea of being apart is difficult for both of us.

But I’ve also realized that there are some things I need to work on for myself, things that I can’t really do with someone else by my side. It’s not about wanting to leave you or find someone else—it’s about needing to take time to reconnect with myself, to grow in ways that are essential for me. I know that this might not be what you want to hear, and I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but I need you to understand that this is something I have to do.

I want us to be able to talk about this openly and figure out what it means for both of us. I’m not asking you to wait for me in a way that feels like a punishment or a test—I just need to take care of myself in a way that I haven’t been able to. If you’re open to it, maybe we can find a way to support each other through this, even if it means being apart for a little while. It doesn’t mean I care any less about you, but I need this time to figure out who I am and what I need to be happy."

---

This approach acknowledges Nina’s fear of being alone but also makes it clear that your need for personal growth is non-negotiable. It opens up the conversation for her to express her feelings while allowing you to explain why this time apart is necessary for you. It’s about balancing compassion for her with the honesty you need to move forward in a way that’s true to yourself.


#### You:
Now can you distill this all conversation down to main points in summaries and don't leave out anything important because I want to share this with my therapist as I mentioned I would do that earlier. Can you put it in a format that would be something I would share with my therapist as well?

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly, here’s a distilled summary of our conversation, formatted in a way that you can share with your therapist:

---

### Summary of Current Situation and Feelings:

1. **Autopilot and Unfulfilled Growth**: I’ve felt like I’ve been on autopilot for at least 7 years, drifting from one relationship to the next without achieving the personal growth and self-realization I desire. I’ve been putting my life on hold to meet the needs of others, especially those I love, which has left me feeling dead inside and frozen in time.

2. **Relationship Dynamics**: In my current relationship with Nina, I feel like our discussions are one-sided, with me doing most of the talking and her mostly listening without engaging. This lack of meaningful interaction adds to my sense of being constrained and unable to grow. I’ve also been frustrated by a past situation with roommates that disrupted my life and routines, leading to a sense of losing a year of my life.

3. **Perception of Others' Realities**: I explained to my stepson that I feel like I’m stuck in the year 1950, aware that it’s actually 2024, while everyone around me—including him and Nina—seems to be living as if nothing significant has changed since then. This perception of others being stuck in a hamster wheel world, living robotically, drives me insane and makes me very depressed.

4. **Consideration of Leaving**: I’m seriously considering leaving at the end of the year to focus on my personal growth and self-realization. I’ve discussed the idea of selling the house and moving closer to my friends and family, but the house won’t be ready for another year due to delays with contractors. I don’t want to leave Nina without support because I’m her best and only friend, but I struggle with not having my own group of friends or support network.

5. **Nina's Response to Possible Separation**: When I previously mentioned the idea of spending some time at my mom’s house to work on myself, Nina responded by saying she probably couldn’t stay alone and would need someone else to be with her. This response was unsettling because it suggests that she isn’t willing to wait for me to address my needs alone. I understand if she wants to grow with me, but I feel this is something I need to do by myself.

### Points for Discussion with Therapist:

- **Navigating the Conversation with Nina**: I need help figuring out how to communicate my feelings to Nina without causing unnecessary pain. I want to express that I’m considering taking time apart to focus on myself, but I’m unsure how to frame this without making her feel abandoned or unloved.

- **Managing the Impact on Nina and My Stepson**: I’m concerned about how my potential departure will affect Nina and my stepson, especially given Nina’s fear of being alone. I want to ensure that they are supported, but I also recognize that I can’t continue living in a way that leaves me feeling dead inside.

- **Balancing Compassion with Honesty**: I’m struggling with balancing my need for honesty about my feelings with compassion for Nina’s feelings. I want to be clear that my desire to leave is about personal growth and not a reflection of my love for her, but I know this will be difficult for her to hear.

### Summary of Current Situation and Feelings:

1. **Autopilot and Unfulfilled Growth**: I’ve felt like I’ve been on autopilot for at least 7 years, drifting from one relationship to the next without achieving the personal growth and self-realization I desire. I’ve been putting my life on hold to meet the needs of others, especially those I love, which has left me feeling dead inside and frozen in time.

2. **Relationship Dynamics**: In my current relationship with Nina, I feel like our discussions are one-sided, with me doing most of the talking and her mostly listening without engaging. This lack of meaningful interaction adds to my sense of being constrained and unable to grow. I’ve also been frustrated by a past situation with roommates that disrupted my life and routines, leading to a sense of losing a year of my life.

#### You:
Also, elijah, my steps on his really grown to love me and has no dad because his dad is dead, so I'm basically like the replacement for his dad and treat him much better, and mean it has kind of banked on that.. not really made a relationship about that but when we first were together as she said and really emphasized that she needed someone who could be a dad to Elijah. And I was willing to do that, it's just that's.. I still haven't been able to figure myself out after many years and I feel like taking on that responsibility plus the responsibility of being a future husband is making it that much harder for me to try to figure out who I am and what I want to be and how I want to do it etc etc etc. I have an accomplished any of the things I want to accomplish yet and I've had 36 years of life to do it and have not accomplished one except a long-term job.

I’ve also been frustrated by a past situation with roommates that disrupted my life and routines, leading to a sense of losing a year of my life.

3. **Responsibility as a Father Figure**: Elijah, my stepson, has grown to love me deeply, especially since his biological father passed away. I’ve essentially become a father figure to him, and from the beginning, Nina emphasized that she needed someone who could be a dad to Elijah. While I was willing to take on that role, I now feel that the responsibility of being a father figure, along with the expectation of being a future husband, has made it even harder for me to figure out who I am, what I want to be, and how I want to live my life. Despite being 36 years old, I feel that I haven’t accomplished the things I want to achieve, apart from holding a long-term job.
