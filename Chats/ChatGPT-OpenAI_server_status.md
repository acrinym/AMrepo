#### You:
I wasn't asking you to repeat the previous output, I was asking you to tell me what an elevated issue is. It sounds to me like it would go up to tier 2 or the next level of support

#### ChatGPT:
An "elevated issue" in the context of system status or operational monitoring typically refers to a problem or anomaly that has increased in severity or frequency, requiring a higher level of attention and urgency.

Here’s how it might apply to a system like OpenAI's:

1. **Detection**: Elevated issues are often identified through automated monitoring systems detecting higher-than-normal error rates, slower performance, or specific failures across services.

2. **Triage**: When an issue is "elevated," it may mean it has been escalated to a higher tier of support (such as Tier 2 or Tier 3). These tiers usually involve more specialized engineers or teams who handle complex or critical problems.

3. **Impact Scope**: Elevated issues often indicate that the problem affects a larger number of users, has a broader impact on functionality, or involves critical services like APIs or authentication systems.

4. **Response**: The response time for elevated issues is usually prioritized. Teams may implement mitigations, apply patches, or adjust configurations to stabilize the system while working on a permanent fix.

5. **Communication**: On status pages like OpenAI's, labeling an incident as "elevated" is a way to inform users that the issue is not isolated or minor. It signals heightened awareness and activity to resolve the problem.

In summary, elevated issues are those that demand increased urgency and resources due to their impact, and often involve escalation to higher levels of technical expertise or management.


#### You:
What are tier 2 and tier 3 etc etc at openai?

#### ChatGPT:
In the context of OpenAI's API services, **usage tiers** determine the rate limits and access levels available to users. These tiers are designed to align with the user's engagement and spending on the platform.

**Understanding OpenAI's Usage Tiers:**

1. **Tier Advancement Criteria:**
   - As users increase their API usage and corresponding spending, OpenAI automatically promotes them to higher usage tiers. This progression typically results in enhanced rate limits across various models. citeturn0search4

2. **Rate Limits:**
   - Each tier comes with specific rate limits, dictating the number of requests a user can make within a given timeframe. Advancing to a higher tier generally provides more generous rate limits, accommodating increased usage demands.

3. **Monitoring and Upgrades:**
   - Users can view their current rate and usage limits under the limits section of their account settings. If a user's usage and spending meet the criteria for a higher tier, the system should automatically upgrade their tier. However, some users have reported delays in this automatic upgrade process. In such cases, contacting OpenAI support or making an additional payment can prompt a reevaluation of the account's tier status. citeturn0search8

#### You:
Under my current tier my current usage tier that is, how many more messages with chat gpt4 do I have

#### ChatGPT:
OpenAI's ChatGPT services offer different usage tiers, each with specific message limits for interactions with models like GPT-4. These tiers are designed to accommodate varying user needs and are subject to change.

**Free Tier:**

- **Access**: Users have limited access to GPT-4, primarily interacting with GPT-3.5.
- **Message Limits**: There are restrictions on the number of messages that can be sent to GPT-4 within a certain timeframe. Specific limits are not publicly detailed and may vary based on system load and OpenAI's policies.

**ChatGPT Plus ($20/month):**

- **Access**: Subscribers receive general access to ChatGPT, even during peak times, faster response times, and priority access to new features and improvements.
- **Message Limits**: While Plus users have increased access to GPT-4, there are still caps on the number of messages within a set period. Historically, this limit has been around 50 messages every three hours, but it can vary.

**ChatGPT Enterprise:**

- **Access**: Designed for business environments, offering enhanced security, improved performance, and advanced data analyses.
- **Message Limits**: Enterprise users benefit from higher or even unlimited message quotas, tailored to organizational needs.

**Determining Your Current Usage and Limits:**

- **Account Dashboard**: Log into your OpenAI account and navigate to the usage or subscription section to view your current tier and any associated message limits.
- **Notifications**: OpenAI typically notifies users when they are approaching or have reached their message limits.

**Upgrading Your Tier:**

- **Subscription Page**: To upgrade your tier and increase message limits, visit OpenAI's subscription page and select a plan that aligns with your requirements.
- **Considerations**: Assess your usage patterns to determine if the benefits of a higher tier justify the cost.

Please note that OpenAI may adjust these tiers and limits over time. For the most current information, refer to OpenAI's official documentation or contact their support.
