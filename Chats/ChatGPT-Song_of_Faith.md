**Verse 1:**
In the land of Babylon, where the golden statue stands,\
King Nebuchadnezzar issued his commands,\
"Bow down and worship, at the sound of the horn,\
Or face the fiery furnace, be forewarned."

**Chorus:**
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,\
With faith unshaken, they let the world know,\
"Our God can save us from the flames so high,\
But even if He doesn't, we won't comply."

**Verse 2:**
The music played, but they stood still,\
Defying the king's decree and will,\
Anger burned in Nebuchadnezzar's eyes,\
"Heat the furnace seven times," he cried.

**Chorus:**
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,\
With faith unshaken, they let the world know,\
"Our God can save us from the flames so high,\
But even if He doesn't, we won't comply."

**Bridge:**
Bound and thrown into the fiery blaze,\
The king was amazed, he couldn't believe his gaze,\
"Didn't we cast three men into the fire?\
Now I see four, unharmed in the pyre."

**Verse 3:**
"Come out," he called, "you servants of the Most High,"\
Not a hair was singed, not a burn in sight,\
The king proclaimed, "Praise be their God,\
Who sent His angel, who spared the rod."

**Chorus:**
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,\
With faith unshaken, they let the world know,\
"Our God can save us from the flames so high,\
But even if He doesn't, we won't comply."

**Outro:**
In the fire, they found their faith anew,\
A story of courage, for me and you,\
Stand firm in trials, let your faith glow,\

#### You:
Now can you write a song based on Genesis 2, the events and characters therein, NIV?

Certainly! Here's a song based on Genesis 2, highlighting the creation of Adam and Eve:

**Verse 1:**
In the beginning, before the world began,\
God formed the earth and the heavens by His hand,\
He planted a garden, Eden was its name,\
A paradise of beauty, where no sin had laid claim.

**Chorus:**
Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground,\
Breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, a living soul was found,\
Adam, the first man, in God's image he was made,\
To tend the garden and name the creatures that God had displayed.

**Verse 2:**
God saw that Adam needed a companion,\
Not found among the animals, no suitable union,\
So He caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man,\
And from his rib, He formed a woman, His perfect plan.

**Chorus:**
Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib He had taken,\
Brought her to Adam, bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, unshaken,\
Eve, the mother of all living, a helper and companion,\
Together in the garden, in God's love, they were fashion.

**Bridge:**
In Eden's garden, they walked with God,\
No shame or fear, no sin's dark facade,\
But tempted by the serpent, they chose to disobey,\
And from that moment on, sin led them astray.

**Verse 3:**
Yet even in their fall, God's mercy did abound,\
He clothed them in garments, His grace profound,\
Though banished from Eden, His love never ceased,\
A promise of redemption, in the future, released.

**Chorus:**
Adam and Eve, the first of humankind,\
In God's image, created, with purpose, designed,\
Their story of creation, a testament of love,\
A reminder of God's faithfulness, from heaven above.Certainly! Here's a song based on Genesis 2, highlighting the creation of Adam and Eve:
