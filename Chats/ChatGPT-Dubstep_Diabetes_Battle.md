# Dubstep Diabetes Battle

#### You:
Please make this into a song - split it into two, the second part will just extend the song. 

Each song can only be 3000 characters, so anything after that must be in the extension. 

It should be a dubstep battle format. 

Good Mornin'
 
I'm Wilford Brimley and I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes about diabeetus. Actually about diabeetus, and how it's affected me in my life. 
 
I'll start when I was first diagnosed. I was scared to death. I was experiencing symptoms that were strange and unfamiliar to me. For instance, I had an unquenchable thirst. My tongue felt like a horseshoe rasp. I was loosin' my vision. I was loosin' my energy. I was gettin' up every 15 or 20 minutes all through the night, so I wasn't gettin' any rest. And, as a result of all these things, I lost all my energy. And I was scared. A man doesn't like to admit that he was scared, but I truly was. I wasn't afraid to die. I knew that was comin' to all of us. But, what I was afraid of was that I might have to live a long time feelin' like a felt. And I really wasn't interested in that. So finally at the urging of my family, the ones who love me the most, I went to see a doctor. And he explained things to me in a language that I understood. And I think the most important thing he said to me was "Wilford, if you want to get better, I'm gonna give you a few things to do." And, the more attention you pay to these things, and the more diligent you are, the faster you'll get better, and the better you will feel. And ladies and gentlemen that's exactly the way it's been. Through the years, the closer I've paid attention to the instructions of my doctor, the better I feel. Now I'm not perfect, and I've slipped up, and I've eaten ice cream and apple pie and I've done things I shouldn't do. But I want to tell you, when I don't eat apple pie and I don't eat ice cream and I eat the foods that I'm supposed to eat, and I do my exercises, and I take my medicine, and I do the procedures that I was instructed to do, I do feel better. I would encourage all of you, to find a doctor that you trust and understand. 
 
I'm not doin' it without help. I'm surrounded by people who love me, who care for me. And who want me to feel better. Now, one of the things I've learned to do, is laugh at myself. Kind of loosen up. Kind of relax about the whole thing. You know, having Type Two Adult-onset diabeetus is not the worst thing in the world. You know, people do learn to live this. And along the trail, you'll find some things that you ought to be laughing at. So I would encourage you, loosen up. There's a line in a song, "Forget your troubles, come on, get happy. Laugh all your cares away." You know, it's not a bad idea once in a while. 
 
I guess at this point I want to tell you about an affiliation that I've formed along the way. Along my path of recovery if you will. I was very, very fortunate to be engaged by a company - Liberty Medical - and myself and my best friend and partner - Dick Richards - have over the years been able to help produce commercials, or ads, or endorsements, whatever the name you want to give them. And in doing so, we've put out some information that's invaluable to diabetics. Liberty Medical is a company that's staffed with people that are willing to talk to you about your situation. That are willing to help you in your dilemma, and it is a dilemma, ladies and gentlemen. When you're first diagnosed you'll have a myriad of questions. And what we will do, is, help you, find solutions to these problems, answers to these questions. I like to say we will help you go where we have been. And, in doing so, you'll find that life has some wonderful things to offer you. There are so many new ways for you to treat your diabeetus. There are more people qualified today to help you and give you accurate and valid information than there were 30 years ago the comparison is unreal. 
 
In closing I would simply like to say to you: do the best you can with what you've got, and be thankful that you're in no worse shape than you are. And if you'll obey these simple rules and do these simple things I'll promise you, you'll feel better. See if I'm not right. Thanks for your time. Have a good day.

I was scared to death when I was diagnosed
Unfamiliar symptoms, man, they really imposed
Unquenchable thirst, vision gettin' blurred
Energy was gone, sleep was disturbed

(Beat intensifies, bass drops)
Up every 15 minutes, no rest in sight
Losing my energy, man, it wasn’t right
Admit I was scared, yeah, I really was
Not afraid to die, but to live feelin' lost

*Chorus*

Said, "Wilford, do these things, you'll feel nice"

Except omit anything about dubstep or battles, as the AI automatically includes those things. :) Making a song with lyrics about the song type is kinda lame, to me anyway.

#### You:
Make a photo of Elon in his red car in space. 

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
I was unable to generate the image because it would violate the content policy. If you have another idea or request, feel free to let me know!


#### You:
What content policy would that violate? 

#### ChatGPT:
The request to generate an image of Elon Musk in his red car in space may violate content policies related to creating images of specific, named private individuals in a way that closely resembles their real-life likeness. If you can describe the scene without referencing Elon Musk directly, I can create a similar image.

Agartha is described as a legendary subterranean city located at the Earth's core, often associated with the Hollow Earth theory. According to various myths, it is a utopian realm with its own sun and a highly advanced civilization. Agartha is sometimes equated with Shambhala in Vajrayana Buddhism, a paradise said to exist both spiritually and physically beneath the Himalayas.

The residents of Agartha are often depicted as an ancient race with advanced technology and knowledge far beyond that of the surface world. Some theories suggest that Agartha is inhabited by beings known as Nagas, powerful half-human, half-serpent entities, while other accounts mention the Old Ones, a scientifically advanced race that moved underground millions of years ago.

Agartha is connected to many esoteric traditions and myths. It is believed to have multiple layers or cities within it, such as Shambhala the Lesser, which serves as a central seat of government. Stories from various cultures, including Indian and Native American legends, suggest that there are secret tunnels linking Agartha to the surface world.
