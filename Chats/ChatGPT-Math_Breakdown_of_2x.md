# Math Breakdown of 2x

#### You:
2x, 2x this this, 2x, 2x that, that. 2x this, 2x that, 2x 2x this that. What would this actually be if you were actually summing

#### ChatGPT:
Let’s break this chaotic-sounding phrase down mathematically and rhythmically to understand what it’s **actually** saying—then compute the total.

### 🔤 **Raw Phrase**

> “2x, 2x this this, 2x, 2x that, that. 2x this, 2x that, 2x 2x this that.”

---

### 🔍 **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

We’ll interpret “2x” as “2 times \[whatever follows]”.

Let’s parse each phrase.

---

#### 🧩 Phrase 1: `2x`

- Incomplete — no subject, but could imply “2x (unspecified)” or possibly a pause.

#### 🧩 Phrase 2: `2x this this`

- Repeats “this” twice.
- So it’s **2x ("this" + "this")** → 2 × 2 = **4 this**

#### 🧩 Phrase 3: `2x`

- Again incomplete unless we see it as a placeholder or beat.

#### 🧩 Phrase 4: `2x that, that`

- Likely means: **2 × (“that” + “that”)** → 2 × 2 = **4 that**

#### 🧩 Phrase 5: `2x this`

- Straightforward: **2 this**

#### 🧩 Phrase 6: `2x that`

- Straightforward: **2 that**

#### 🧩 Phrase 7: \`2x 2xLet’s break this chaotic-sounding phrase down mathematically and rhythmically to understand what it’s **actually** saying—then compute the total.

No it's that jump rope thing. Double double this this double double that that double this double that double double this that

#### ChatGPT:
Ahhh YES! 🔥 You're talking about the **classic hand game / jump rope rhyme** — the **"Double Double" clapping chant**. Here's the one you're referencing:

> **"Double double this this,\
> Double double that that,\
> Double this, double that,\
> Double double this that."**

---

Let’s break it down **in rhythmic and structural terms**, and **then translate it into math** as if you were summing the number of words or actions.

---

## 🕹️ CHANT STRUCTURE:

Each “double” means “say or clap the next word twice.”

So let’s interpret line by line:

---

### 🔹 Line 1:

**“Double double this this”**\
→ “Double” (x2) → apply to “this this”

- "this this" is already doubled\
  ✅ Total: **2 “double”s**, **2 “this”s** = **4 actions**

---

### 🔹 Line 2:

**“Double double that that”**\
→ Same structure\
✅ Total: **2 “double”s**, **2 “that”s** = **4 actions**

---

### 🔹 Line 3:

**“Double this, double that”**\
→ Each “double” applies to just one word

- “double this” → this this
- “double that” → that that\
  ✅ Total: **2 “this”s, 2 “that”s** = **4 actions**

---

### 🔹 Line 4:

**“Double double this that”**\
→ This is trickier.

- Two “double”s means you're doubling the *pair* “this that”
- So: “this that, this that”

✅ Total: **2 “this”s, 2 “that”s** = **4 actions**

---

## 🧮 Final Tally:

| Word   | Count                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| double | 6 (spoken, but not clapped or acted on directly) |
| this   | **6 times**                                      |
| that   | **6 times**                                      |

➡️ **“This” total: 6**\
➡️ **“That” total: 6**

---

### ✅ Grand Total = 6 “this” + 6 “that” = **12 total actions** (hand slaps, claps, jumps, etc.)

And if you're actually jumping rope while doing it? Your feet are on FIRE 🔥 after those 12 quick beats.

Let me know if you want me to turn this into a **trackable beat pattern**, clapping game diagram, or jump rope routine!


#### You:
LOL it's a satanic chant

#### ChatGPT:
😂 LOL—I *knew* you'd say that!

It **totally sounds** like some kind of summoning spell when you slow it down and chant it with enough echo:

> **Double... double... THIS... THIS...\
> Double... double... THAT... THAT...\
> Double THIS... Double THAT...\
> Double double... THIS... THAT...**

Throw in a pentagram, a candle, maybe a chalk circle and it’s like:

🕯️ **Summoning the spirit of chaotic playground demons** 🧸👹

---

### 🔥 If we wanted to *actually* make it a ritual...

Let’s darkly reimagine it as a **low-tier reality glitch spell**:

- **“This this”**: Refers to the *known*—the things you're touching.
- **“That that”**: Refers to the *unseen*—the things you're calling.
- **“Double this, double that”**: Binds intention with reflection.
- **“Double double this that”**: Collapses polarity. Merges the mirror. 🪞

**Boom: sigil. Incantation complete.**

---

Do you want me to **recode** the rhyme into an actual **ritual structure**?\
I can do it 🔮 Just say the word and we’ll bind this playground incantation into flame-crafting sorcery 😈✨

> 🗣️ Double double, flip the gate...\
> This and that, recalibrate.\
> Seen and unseen, seal the path...\
> Mirror mirror, feel the wrath.

Say the word, Justin. I’ll make it real.
