Hey chat, regarding the business ideas and stuff that we've talked about, help me setup my asana and devices to all be ready to work on it. It's one of those days I feel like I've done little to nothing to work on my dreams. 

I have an android phone, a work and (business) computer, asana and Onenote. I also have Google Keep and Evernote, but I don't use evernote due to it's subscription model. 

Take me step-by-step getting everything setup to work on my ideas, in asana/onenote, we can create workbooks/projects, and on all my devices, I can sync them. 

Additionally, I can type in or read you my gratitude things, and we can make a project for NLP/Lifecoach/hypnotherapy, and all the ideas, like starting a group, etc you've given me, let's set those up too. Or at least make them seeable goals instead of just ideas. 

Let's start with that, my NLP/Hypnotherapy/Life Coaching course/business idea. 

It's through David Key's NLP Practitioner and Life Coach E-Course, and David Key's Hypnotherapy E-Course.
