Here’s a list of rhymes and near-rhymes with **"love"** that go beyond the usual "above" and "shove" clichés:

### 🔹 **Perfect Rhymes (Rare for 'love'):**

There honestly aren't many *perfect* rhymes in English. "Dove" is one of the few:

- **Dove** (the bird or past of "dive" in poetic usage)
- **Glove**

### 🔹 **Slant/Near Rhymes (Creative & Poetic):**

These bend the rules a little, but they work beautifully in songwriting and poetry:

- **Of**
- **Enough**
- **Tough**
- **Rough**
- **Snuff**
- **Buff**
- **Bluff**
- **Cuff**
- **Stuff**

### 🔹 **Assonance/Consonance Rhymes (Vowel or ending match):**

Good for lyrical writing when you’re after vibe over precision:

- **Above** (you already mentioned it)
- **Beloved** (for a lyrical or archaic tone)
- **Unlove**
- **Thereof**
- **Dream of**
- **Think of**
- **Let go of**

- *"Push and shove"*
- *"Empty glove"*
- *"Rise above"*
- *"Call it love"*
