#### You:
You think if Trump has his way and a whole bunch of manufacturing and jobs and things moved back to the US, that planned obsolescence will go away at least a little bit? And things will go back to being repairable etc

#### ChatGPT:
If Trump (or any leader with a similar economic vision) successfully brings significant manufacturing and jobs back to the United States, there could be a chance for some reduction in planned obsolescence, but the extent of such a shift depends on several factors:

### **Why Planned Obsolescence Exists**

1. **Profit-Driven Models**:
   - Planned obsolescence is a strategy used by companies to maximize profits by ensuring products need replacement or upgrades, driving continuous consumer spending.
   - This strategy is deeply embedded in capitalist systems, regardless of where manufacturing occurs.

2. **Consumer Demand**:
   - Modern consumer culture prioritizes newness and rapid innovation, especially in tech and fashion, perpetuating obsolescence.

3. **Global Supply Chains**:
   - Many components are sourced globally. Even if assembly moves back to the U.S., parts may still depend on international suppliers.

### **What Could Change with U.S.-Based Manufacturing**

1. **Focus on Quality**:
   - Historically, U.S.-made products were associated with durability and repairability. Bringing manufacturing back might encourage higher-quality production standards, as higher costs for domestic labor incentivize longer-lasting goods to justify higher prices.

2. **Shift in Policy**:
   - If the U.S. government promotes regulations against planned obsolescence (e.g., "right to repair" laws), domestic manufacturing could align with these principles, fostering repairable and durable products.

3. **Market Pressure**:
   - Domestic jobs and manufacturing could allow for more localized economies, where consumers demand accountability and quality from brands they associate with their communities.

4. **Reduced Logistics**:
   - Shorter supply chains could make repairing and recycling products more cost-effective than replacement, supporting repairability.

### **Challenges to Overcoming Planned Obsolescence**

1. **Corporate Resistance**:
   - Corporations might resist abandoning planned obsolescence unless there’s strong market demand for repairable goods or legal mandates enforcing it.
   - Many large tech companies, for example, fight against "right to repair" laws to protect their profit margins.

2. **Consumer Habits**:
   - Even with repairable, long-lasting goods available, consumers might still opt for "new and shiny," especially in competitive markets like electronics.

3. **Economic Incentives**:
   - The global economy often rewards cost-cutting and efficiency over durability, which could make high-quality U.S. manufacturing less competitive without subsidies or incentives.

### **Hopeful Trends**

- **Right to Repair Movement**:
  - Growing public demand for repairable products, especially in tech, could gain more traction with local manufacturing.
  - States like New York and Massachusetts have begun passing laws supporting this movement.

- **Environmental Awareness**:
  - As environmental concerns rise, consumers and governments are pushing for sustainable products, which may include repairability and durability.

- **Technological Innovation**:
  - Advances in modular design (e.g., Fairphone) might inspire broader shifts toward repairable products.

### **Would Planned Obsolescence Disappear?**

It’s unlikely to vanish entirely. However:

- With local jobs and manufacturing, there’s potential for more repairable and higher-quality products.
- Economic nationalism could foster pride in durability and craftsmanship, similar to historical perceptions of U.S.-made goods.
- Government policies could play a critical role by regulating or incentivizing repairable designs.

Ultimately, the extent of change would depend on consumer behavior, corporate adaptation, and whether policymakers see long-term value in fighting planned obsolescence. If the economic system remains heavily profit-driven without regulatory change, obsolescence might persist, even in domestically produced goods.
