#### You:

[audio] Idiotics, can you hear me?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] I can hear you loud and clear!


#### You:

[audio] I could hear you loud and clear.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Perfect! How can I help


#### You:

[audio] All right, so got it.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Yes? Go ahead!


#### You:

[audio] So, bye. Have a good one. 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It seems like the call might have cut off. Can you hear me now?


#### You:

[audio] Thank you.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Great, I'm here! What's up?


#### You:

[audio] Thanks everyone. 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Sounds like something's on your mind! What's going on?


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] I'm not sure! You mentioned "alright, so," earlier. Was there something you wanted to talk about?


#### You:

[audio] Is the call okay still?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Yes, the call seems fine now! We're connected.


#### You:

[audio] So, uh, I was wondering, what happens if you sue a company or file a lawsuit against a company that's currently in bankruptcy?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Well, suing a bankrupt company can be complicated. Once a company declares bankruptcy, an automatic stay

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Well, suing a bankrupt company can be complicated. Once a company declares bankruptcy, an automatic stay is put in place, halting most

[audio] ...halting most legal proceedings against it. This means your lawsuit would

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...would be paused. To proceed, you'd typically need permission from the bankruptcy court. Even if you win, collecting the judgment can be challenging, as creditors are paid according to a priority system, and unsecured creditors often receive less than they're owed.


#### You:

[audio] I see. So all of the people suing Johnson & Johnson for ill effects from the COVID-19 vaccine will not get recompensed because Johnson & Johnson just filed bankruptcy. So I'm pretty sure that's why they filed bankruptcy, because so many people had bad effects from taking the vaccine.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] If a company like Johnson & Johnson files for bankruptcy, it complicates ongoing lawsuits. In bankruptcy, the company’s assets are reorganized to pay creditors. Those with claims related to vaccine side effects might be considered unsecured creditors. They could still receive compensation, but it would likely be a reduced amount and take longer. Companies sometimes file for bankruptcy for various reasons, including overwhelming legal liabilities, but proving intent behind such a move can be complex.


#### You:

[audio] Alright, so if a contractor does work for someone and there's a contract, and then they never fulfill their end of the bargain, what is that type of lawsuit called? I know it's not bankruptcy, and I know it's not uncompleted work, or something uncomplicated. There's a complicated word for what that's called. What is it?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] When a contractor fails to fulfill their end of a contract, the issue is called "breach of contract." This occurs when one party doesn't perform as specified in the agreement, and the other party can take legal action to seek remedies, such as damages or specific performance. It's not about bankruptcy or unfinished work


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] You're welcome! If


#### You:

[audio] I know that's the name of what it's called when you don't finish a job, but there's a sue, a lawsuit that you can file, or a legal tactic that you can use to harm the individual who harmed you in not fulfilling the duties that they were performing, or they were supposed to perform. What is that legal tactic used to sue an individual who has not performed their duty of contract?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] The legal tactic you're referring to is still a breach of contract lawsuit. When someone fails to fulfill their contractual obligations, the harmed party can file a lawsuit seeking remedies, which might include compensatory damages, punitive damages, or specific performance. This applies to both individuals and companies.


#### You:

[audio] Onyx, if you check stopthepirates.blogspot.com, he's got some interesting information about how to sue an individual who caused you damages, and I can't remember what it's called, but he outlines it on his blog.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] I can't check websites or browse the internet, but it sounds like the blog might discuss legal strategies for pursuing damages. This could involve various types of claims depending on the situation, such as negligence, fraud, or intentional infliction of emotional distress, in addition to breach of contract. If you’re dealing with a specific situation, it might be helpful to consult a legal professional for tailored advice.


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Yes, suing a


#### You:

[audio] The legal remedy that, it turns out, the thing I'm looking for, the word I'm looking for, the phrase I'm looking for, is called a commercial lien, where you can sue an individual who runs a company, etc., instead of the entire company, and get much more success.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Ah, I see! You're referring to a "commercial lien." This is a legal claim against an individual's assets rather than the company's. It can be more effective in certain cases, especially if the company has limited assets. This approach might be used when someone personally guarantees a contract or engages in wrongful acts while running a business. It's a more targeted way to pursue damages. Thanks for clarifying!


#### You:

[audio] So we recently had people work on our house, or an individual work on our house, who never fulfilled his job duties and said he was going to, and then he got injured, and he has not contacted us back, and it's been a year, and he was supposed to have been done over a year ago.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That sounds really frustrating, especially with such a long delay. In a case like this, you might consider a few options. First, you could send a demand letter, outlining the work that was agreed upon and the lack of completion, giving a deadline for the contractor to respond or finish the work. If that doesn't work, you could explore filing a breach of contract lawsuit. Consulting with a lawyer would be a good idea to understand your options and the best course of action.


#### You:

[audio] So there wasn't actually a contract that was signed by the...

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...contract, there may still be a verbal agreement, which can sometimes be enforceable. In such cases, you could claim breach of an oral contract.


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...contract, there may still be a verbal agreement, which can sometimes be enforceable. In such cases, you could claim breach of an oral contract. It's a bit more challenging to prove, but evidence like text messages, emails, or witnesses can support your claim. It would be wise to discuss your situation with a lawyer to explore your options for recovering damages or compelling the contractor to complete the work.


#### You:

[audio] Commercial lien required in such a situation.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] A commercial lien is typically used by businesses against other businesses or individuals in a commercial context, often involving debts or unpaid invoices. In your situation, a commercial lien might not be the most appropriate or effective remedy. You'd likely be looking at other legal avenues, such as a breach of an oral contract or a claim for unjust enrichment. Consulting with a lawyer would give you a clearer picture of your options.


#### You:

[audio] But would a commercial lien work in this situation?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] A commercial lien might not be the best fit for this situation. Commercial liens are more commonly used in business-to-business contexts, particularly involving unpaid debts or obligations. In your case, dealing with an individual contractor who failed to complete home repairs, you'd be more likely to pursue a claim for breach of an oral contract or unjust enrichment. A lawyer could guide you on the most suitable legal strategy for your specific circumstances.


#### You:

[audio] Unjust enrichment, tell me about that.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...another's expense in a way that's considered unjust. For example, if a contractor was paid for home repairs but didn't complete the work, they've been enriched by the payment without fulfilling their part of the deal. To claim unjust enrichment, you'd typically need to show that the other party was enriched,

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...another's expense in a way that's considered unjust. For example, if a contractor was paid for home repairs but didn't complete the work, they've been enriched by the payment without fulfilling their part of the deal. To claim unjust enrichment, you'd typically need to show that the other party was enriched, that the enrichment was at your expense, and that it would be unjust for them to keep that benefit without compensating you. It's a way to seek restitution when no formal contract exists, or when a contract doesn't cover the specific situation.


#### You:

[audio] Is that claim made in Small Claims Court, or is that a civil case?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Claims of unjust enrichment can be pursued in either small claims court or through a civil lawsuit, depending on the amount of money involved. Small claims court is typically used for smaller disputes, usually involving amounts up to a certain limit, which varies by jurisdiction. If the amount you're seeking exceeds this limit, you would need to file a civil lawsuit in


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...in a higher court. Small claims court is more straightforward, with simpler procedures and no need for a lawyer, making it a good option for smaller claims. For larger or more complex cases, a civil


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...a civil court would be the appropriate venue. It allows for more formal procedures and the possibility of


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...handling larger sums of money. The process is more complex and may require legal representation, but it provides a thorough avenue for resolving significant disputes.


#### You:

[audio] So, that's significant.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] If the claim exceeds the limit for small claims court, you'd generally pursue it in a civil court. This court can handle larger amounts and

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] ...provide a more formal process, allowing for comprehensive legal procedures and representation. It's the appropriate venue for claims that surpass the small claims limit.
