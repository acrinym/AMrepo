Alright, let's do this! "It Works" by R.H. Jarrett is a popular book on manifestation that focuses on the power of clear, concise written goals. To format your text using the principles from "It Works," you'll need to follow a few key steps:

1. **Define Your Goals**: Be specific about what you want. Write down your goals in clear and precise terms. Make sure they are realistic and achievable.

2. **Write Daily**: Every morning and evening, write down your goals. This helps keep them at the forefront of your mind and aligns your subconscious with your desires.

3. **Visualize and Feel**: Spend a few moments each day visualizing yourself achieving your goals. Feel the emotions associated with their achievement as if they have already happened.

4. **Stay Positive**: Maintain a positive mindset and believe in the certainty of achieving your goals. Avoid negative thoughts or doubts.

5. **Action Steps**: Break down your goals into actionable steps. Outline what you need to do to move closer to achieving them.

Here's an example format based on these principles:
