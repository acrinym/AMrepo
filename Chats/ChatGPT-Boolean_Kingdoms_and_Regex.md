# Boolean Kingdoms and Regex

#### You:
Write a story involving boolean operands and operators only, but also include RegEx. That gives you more to work with. :)

### The Tale of Boolean Kingdoms and the RegEx Oracle

In the distant realm of **Logiclandia**, two kingdoms ruled the land: the **True** Kingdom and the **False** Kingdom. These kingdoms, locked in an eternal binary dance, were governed by the laws of Boolean Operators—powerful rules that determined truth and falsehood. The kingdoms coexisted peacefully, but their interactions were mediated by the **Gatekeepers of Logic**, each embodying one of the sacred operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `XOR`.

Between the two kingdoms lay the **Regex Rift**, a mystical chasm of patterns and symbols capable of shaping reality. The Regex Oracle resided there, a wise and cryptic being who spoke in patterns and answered questions with matches or failures. Only those who understood the arcane language of regular expressions could unlock its secrets.

---

### The Conflict Begins

One day, a shadow fell over Logiclandia. The **Null Void**, a strange and chaotic force, began corrupting truths and spreading falsehoods, threatening to collapse both kingdoms into an eternal error state. The Gatekeepers convened to find a solution.

"Only the Regex Oracle can decipher the origin of this chaos," declared **AND**, whose steadfast logic demanded certainty.

"Then we must journey to the Oracle," said **OR**, ever the diplomat, seeking solutions through inclusion.

"But beware," warned **NOT**, the contrarian. "The Oracle answers only those who ask with precision."

---

### The Regex Quest

The Gatekeepers set off, their path strewn with Boolean challenges. At the edge of the Regex Rift, they encountered the **Wildcard Warriors**, whose chaotic symbols defied straightforward logic.

**AND** stepped forward and declared, "Let only those patterns that match both `truth` and `certainty` pass."

The Wildcards hissed and tried to confuse them with shifting patterns, but **AND** conjured the spell:

```regex
(?=.*truth)(?=.*certainty).*
```

The Wildcards froze, their forms aligning perfectly. The Gatekeepers passed.

---

Next, they reached the **Alternation Abyss**, where paths forked infinitely.

"Choose the path that matches either `clarity` or `logic`," said **OR**, with a confident flourish.

The Gatekeepers chanted the incantation:

```regex
(clarity|logic)
```

The correct path shimmered into view, and they advanced.

---

Finally, at the chasm's end, the **Negators of Chaos** loomed. They twisted patterns into their opposite meanings, threatening to trap the Gatekeepers in infinite loops.

"Leave this to me," said **NOT**, stepping forward with grim resolve. "Show me patterns that do NOT match `falsehood`."

With a deft motion, **NOT** cast:

```regex
^(?!.*falsehood).*
```

The Negators dissolved, their chaos unraveled.

---

### The Oracle Speaks

At last, the Gatekeepers stood before the Regex Oracle. Its form flickered, composed of parentheses, brackets, and pipes.

"Speak your query," the Oracle intoned, "but beware: your pattern must be flawless."

The Gatekeepers combined their strengths, crafting the ultimate query to uncover the source of the Null Void:

```regex
^(?=.*truth)(?=.*logic)(?!.*chaos).*
```

The Oracle processed their request, matching the pattern against the very fabric of Logiclandia. The Null Void’s origin was revealed: a rogue pattern introduced by the **Unchecked Input**, a being who had bypassed the safeguards of Boolean order.

---

### Restoring Balance

Armed with the knowledge, the Gatekeepers banished the Null Void using the **Regex of Rectification**, a powerful spell that cleansed corruption:

```regex
s/chaos//g
```

With the Null Void vanquished, Logiclandia was saved. The True and False Kingdoms returned to their eternal balance, and the Regex Oracle, satisfied with their mastery of patterns, granted them its blessing.

---

### Epilogue

The Gatekeepers returned as heroes, their journey a testament to the power of Boolean operators and the precision of regex. In Logiclandia, truth and falsehood thrived together, forever bound by the laws of logic and the patterns of reality.

And so, Logiclandia endured, a realm of balance and clarity, where even chaos could be tamed by the perfect expression.### The Tale of Boolean Kingdoms and the RegEx Oracle

Now, include more Regex in Chapter 2: Frobozz (the second - referencing Zork, which again, gives more  context for a better, more varied story).

### Chapter 2: Frobozz and the Puzzle of Patterns

The Gatekeepers of Logiclandia, fresh from their victory over the Null Void, found themselves summoned to the legendary **Frobozz Caverns**. Frobozz, an enigmatic wizard of great renown, had constructed a labyrinth of puzzles that only the sharpest minds could solve. The caverns were rumored to hold the **Regex Codex**, an ancient artifact of unmatched power, capable of unraveling even the most complex patterns.

The Gatekeepers had no choice but to accept the challenge. Frobozz's labyrinth would test not only their understanding of Boolean logic but also their mastery of the Regex arts.

---

### Entering Frobozz Caverns

The entrance to the caverns shimmered with glowing text:

> "Match the phrase that contains **'Frobozz'** but does not end with **'Wizard'**."

**NOT**, eager to flex its contrarian prowess, stepped forward and crafted the expression:

```regex
^(?=.*Frobozz)(?!.*Wizard$).*
```

The shimmering text faded, and the entrance creaked open, revealing a maze of twisting passages.

---

### The Maze of Alternation

Deep within the caverns, the Gatekeepers reached a fork in the path. Each branch bore an inscription:

- **Left:** "logic OR clarity."
- **Right:** "chaos AND darkness."

**OR** knew the solution lay in choosing the inclusive path. She whispered the spell:

```regex
^(logic|clarity)$
```

The inscription on the left glowed softly, confirming the correct route. The Gatekeepers proceeded.

---

### The Wall of Wildcards

After navigating the maze, the Gatekeepers encountered a towering wall inscribed with chaotic symbols and a taunting riddle:

> "Find the patterns matching exactly five characters, starting with **'F'** and ending with **'z'**."

**AND**, always precise, tackled this challenge. Drawing on the Regex Codex's teachings, he devised:

```regex
^F.{3}z$
```

The wall rumbled as the correct matches were revealed: **"Frozz"** and **"Frobz."** The symbols aligned, and the wall parted.

---

### The Chamber of Repetition

Beyond the wall, the Gatekeepers entered a chamber where rows of mirrors reflected endless strings of text. Frobozz's voice boomed from above:

> "Find strings where the sequence **'bo'** repeats exactly three times."

This was a task for **Regex Precision**. **NOT** and **OR** combined their powers to construct the perfect solution:

```regex
^(?=(?:.*bo){3})(?!.*bo.*bo.*bo.*bo).*
```

The mirrors trembled as the correct strings emerged from the reflections: **"bobobobo"** and **"frobozzzbo."** The chamber dissolved, revealing a spiral staircase leading down.

---

### The Final Guardian

At the base of the staircase stood the **Regex Golem**, a hulking construct made of parentheses, pipes, and brackets. Its challenge boomed like thunder:

> "Match only palindromes with an even number of characters."

The Gatekeepers pooled their knowledge, crafting an intricate pattern:

```regex
^(?:(.)(?:(.))\2\1)+$
```

The Golem hesitated, then lowered its arms, granting passage to the Regex Codex.

---

### Frobozz Revealed

As the Gatekeepers approached the Codex, Frobozz appeared, cackling.

"You have proven your worth," the wizard said. "The Regex Codex is yours—but be warned: its power can corrupt those who wield it carelessly."

The Codex shimmered, inscribed with patterns that could shape reality. The Gatekeepers accepted it with reverence, knowing its true value lay in their unity and discipline.

---

### Epilogue: Logiclandia's Champions

Returning to Logiclandia, the Gatekeepers used the Regex Codex to strengthen the realm's defenses. The Regex arts, now fully mastered, became an integral part of Logiclandia's culture, ensuring that no pattern—be it chaos or order—could ever threaten their world again.

And in the shadows of the Regex Rift, the Oracle smiled, knowing the balance between logic and patterns was secure. For now.
