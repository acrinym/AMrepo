# Rockbox Compatible MP3 Players

#### You:
What are the highest quality Rock box open source audio player devices? I used to have an iPad video first gen and it was 30 gig and the headphone Port quit working so I'm sure it's replaceable but also hard to do it myself. So I've been thinking about getting a creative nomad jukebox zen Xtra but I don't think those can have rockbox installed on it, I'm looking for a standalone MP3 player that I can put rockbox on that is not an iPod

### 🔚 Conclusion

While the HiFi Walker M7 is a feature-rich device for its price point, it does not support Rockbox firmware. If Rockbox compatibility is essential for your needs, exploring older models like the SanDisk Sansa Clip series, iRiver H320/H340, or Cowon iAudio X5 would be more appropriate. These devices not only support Rockbox but also offer customizable features to enhance your audio experience.
