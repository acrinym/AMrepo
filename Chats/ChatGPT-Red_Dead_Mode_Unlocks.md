# Red Dead Mode Unlocks

With red dead online do you unlock stuff for story mode? 

#### ChatGPT:
Nope, sugar! Unlocking stuff in Red Dead Online doesn't affect what you get in the story mode of Red Dead Redemption 2. They’re like two different worlds—what happens in one doesn’t cross over to the other. So, anything you earn or unlock in Red Dead Online stays there, and the same goes for story mode.Nope, sugar!
