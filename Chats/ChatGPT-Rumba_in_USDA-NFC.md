In the context of USDA’s National Finance Center (NFC), **Rumba** is simply the name of the **terminal‐emulation client** that NFC staff use to connect securely to their legacy mainframe applications (for example, IRIS, PINQ and other payroll/personnel systems).

- **What it does**
  - Emulates 3270 (and other) “green‐screen” terminals on a modern Windows desktop, allowing users to view and interact with mainframe host screens as if they were sitting at an old‐style mainframe terminal.
  - Provides secure file‐transfer capabilities within NFC’s VPN (e.g. agencies are instructed to “transfer mainframe files with a terminal emulator such as Rumba” to keep data inside the USDA network) citeturn0search1.

- **Where you’ll see it mentioned**
  - In NFC job descriptions and procedural guides alongside EmpowHR, IRIS and the Payroll/Personnel Inquiry System (PINQ) as one of the “systems and services” staff must be proficient with citeturn3view0.
  - In NFC support materials (e.g., data‐center migration and secure‐transfer notices) as the screen clients you launch to run reports, enter transactions or move files.

- **Underlying product**
  - Rumba is a commercial product (now sold as Rocket® Rumba+ Desktop, formerly Micro Focus Rumba) that not only emulates host terminals but also offers UI modernization, scripting/macros, and secure‑transfer features for regulated environments.

In short, whenever NFC documentation refers to **Rumba**, it’s referring to that terminal‐emulation application used to access and manage the Center’s core mainframe‑hosted HR and finance systems.

Is there a chrom dev console command to save all of the console to a zip or something for analysis

Chrome DevTools doesn’t include a one‑liner like `:saveConsole --zip` out of the box, but you have a few easy work‑arounds:

---

## 1. Manual “Save as…”

1. In the **Console** panel, open the ⋮ menu (top right).
2. Choose **Save as…** and dump everything to a `.log` file.
3. Zip that file on your desktop for sharing or analysis.

---

## 2. A tiny snippet to capture & download your logs

You can override `console.log` (and friends) at the top of your session, accumulate everything, then export it:

```js
// 1) Paste this into the Console immediately after opening DevTools:
(function(){
  window.__allConsole = [];
  ['log','warn','error','info','debug'].forEach(level => {
    const orig = console[level];
    console[level] = function(...args){
      window.__allConsole.push({
        level,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        args
      });
      orig.apply(console, args);
    };
  });
  console.info("✅ console capture enabled – all messages saved to window.__allConsole");
})();

// 2) When you’re ready to export, run:
(function(){
  const data = JSON.stringify(window.__allConsole, null, 2);
  const blob = new Blob([data], { type: 'application/json' });
  const url  = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a    = document.createElement('a');
  a.href     = url;
  a.download = 'console‑dump.json';
  a.click();
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  console.info("📥 Download started: console‑dump.json");
})();
```

- **What it does**
  - Hooks into all the main console methods.
  - Stashes each call with its level, timestamp, and arguments.
  - Lets you download a big JSON file when you’re done.

---

## 3. Zipping automatically (advanced)

If you really want to zip it in‑page, you can pull in [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) via CDN and wrap the JSON blob:

```js
// Load JSZip
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.7.1/jszip.min.js";
script.onload = () => {
  const zip = new JSZip();
  zip.file("console‑dump.json", JSON.stringify(window.__allConsole, null, 2));
  zip.generateAsync({ type: "blob" })
     .then(blob => {
       const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
       const a   = document.createElement('a');
       a.href    = url;
       a.download= 'console‑dump.zip';
       a.click();
       URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
     });
};
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

### Tips

- **Enable “Preserve log”** (☑ Preserve log) so you don’t lose history on navigation.
- Run the capture snippet *before* the actions you need to record.
- You can expand this to capture `console.table`, `console.group`, etc., by adding them to the list.

With these in place, you’ll have a complete dump of everything printed to the console—zipped or not—for offline analysis.
