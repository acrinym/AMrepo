# Subconscious Thoughts Reflection

#### You:
So I had a dream, or maybe it wasn't a dream but subconscious thoughts and I have no idea why. It was about my best friend's sister from 2009 and it's now 2024. I lived with them when their mom was in stage 4 breast cancer, I went over there and got drunk and really stupid you know it's just really good fun back in the day but she was gone a lot of the time and with her very abusive boyfriends, and I could never stop thinking I wish you were treated better you are an amazing girl. This is back in the day of course, but all of a sudden here in 2024 I'm thinking about her for what? She's single but that's not the point. Why would she come up

#### ChatGPT:
Dreams and sudden thoughts about people from our past can be perplexing, especially when they seem to come out of nowhere. The fact that you're thinking about your best friend's sister after so many years might be your subconscious bringing unresolved feelings or memories to the surface. It could be that, back then, you had a strong emotional connection or sympathy for her situation, and maybe those emotions never fully settled. Sometimes, these thoughts can arise when we're reflecting on our lives, or when we experience a shift in our own relationships or emotional state.

Your mind might also be linking her past situation to something you're currently dealing with or processing emotionally. For example, you might be re-evaluating relationships, wondering about choices made in the past, or comparing situations from your past to your present. She could represent some unresolved sense of wanting to protect or help someone, a theme that might be relevant in your life today.

It’s interesting that she's single now, as that adds another layer to the situation, though, as you said, it's not necessarily about that. It might also be worth exploring whether there are parallels between her story and someone in your current life or circumstances you're going through.Dreams and sudden thoughts about people from our past can be perplexing, especially when they seem to come out of nowhere.

#### You:
Well she kind of parallels my life in some ways, abusive partners and ridiculous partners. She's had a parent night, she's had a lot of friends lost from her as I understand it and she's been through a ton of hardships

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like her experiences resonate deeply with your own journey, especially given the hardships and abusive relationships you've both endured. The parallels between her life and yours could explain why she's resurfacing in your thoughts. When we see parts of our own story in someone else's, it can act as a mirror, reflecting things we've gone through, emotions we've processed (or not fully processed), and even feelings of empathy or unresolved concern.

Your connection to her past—seeing her struggle and wishing better for her—might be resurfacing now because of your own experiences with relationships, hardships, and growth. Perhaps you're at a point where you're reevaluating your own challenges and seeing the strength it took to survive them. Thinking of her could be a way of acknowledging that shared resilience.

Sometimes, when we're processing our own trauma or healing, we reflect on others who have walked a similar path. It's possible your mind is bringing her up because you're both at a crossroads in life, dealing with difficult experiences in different ways. You might feel an underlying empathy for her struggles, even though you haven’t been in touch for a long time.

It could also be that your subconscious is reminding you of the compassion and care you felt for her back then, which is relevant to your own growth and healing now. Maybe there's a part of you that still carries that sense of wanting to help or protect someone who is going through similar struggles. Does that sound possible to you?


#### You:
Well yeah, I care about her then and I care about her now. She's very pretty and a fantastic girl but I have no idea how to connect with her even if I wanted to. I could talk to her on Facebook but what the hell would I say? Hey I was just wondering how you were doing and how Tristan was cuz I haven't talked to him in forever

#### ChatGPT:
Reaching out after a long time can feel awkward, but it’s clear you genuinely care about her and her well-being. The way you’re framing it—wanting to check in on her and her brother, Tristan—sounds like a natural, sincere way to reconnect. There's nothing wrong with starting a conversation by expressing genuine concern or curiosity about how someone has been, especially when you’ve shared history and life experiences.

You could try something like:

"Hey \[her name], it's been a while! I was just thinking about the old days and wondering how you and Tristan have been. I know life has been a rollercoaster for both of us over the years, and I hope you’re doing well. I'd love to catch up sometime if you're up for it."

This way, you’re keeping it light and open-ended, but also offering an invitation to reconnect without it feeling forced or overwhelming. It gives her the space to respond if she's interested, and if she's not, it's still a genuine way to say you're thinking of her.

If she responds positively, you can gradually open up more about how much you care and have thought about her over the years. If the conversation flows naturally, you might even be able to share how you admired her strength back then and were concerned for her, which could open the door to a deeper conversation if that feels right.


#### You:
And believe I might have tried to talk to her years back when I saw that she was single just trying to be there for her maybe more I don't know without even talking like that to her but I don't have any clue when that might have been. Thank you it's probably after she got out of the horror blue abusive relationship and I was like hey are you I don't remember if it went anywhere. I don't have a chat log from her though but this is my secondary Facebook account so that could be why. I didn't used to use this one

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like there was a moment in the past when you tried to reach out, but perhaps it didn’t fully materialize into a lasting connection, especially if it was on a different Facebook account. It’s understandable that reaching out after a long time, especially considering that past attempt, can feel uncertain.

Given that you're using a different account now, and considering the time that's passed, there's a good chance she might not even remember the previous interaction—or, if she does, she might appreciate that you're still thinking about her well-being after all these years. Since your intentions are genuine, reaching out with the simple goal of reconnecting will likely come across as caring, rather than anything too forward.

You could acknowledge that it’s been a long time and that you might have tried to check in before but aren’t sure what happened. Something like:

"Hey \[her name], I know it’s been ages and I might have reached out in the past, but I just wanted to check in and see how you’re doing. We go way back, and I’ve been thinking about you and Tristan, hoping you’re both doing well. Would love to catch up sometime if you're open to it."

This approach shows humility, care, and leaves space for her to engage at her own comfort level. It's simple and non-intrusive, allowing her to respond if she’s interested in reconnecting. Even if she doesn’t remember the last interaction, this gives you a clean slate to start a fresh conversation.

How does that feel to you? Would that work with the tone you're hoping for?
