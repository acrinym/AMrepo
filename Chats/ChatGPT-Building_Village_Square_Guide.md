To build the village square in the Dry Valley Desert biome as part of the Rebel and Imperial questline in LEGO Fortnite, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Gather Resources

Before you start building, make sure you have enough resources. You'll typically need bricks, wood, and metal to construct the village square. These can be gathered by breaking down structures, rocks, trees, and other objects in the biome.

### Step 2: Access the Workbench

Once you have enough resources, go to a workbench. The workbench is your primary tool for crafting and building larger structures in LEGO Fortnite.

### Step 3: Select the Village Square Blueprint

At the workbench, look for the village square blueprint. If you don't have it yet, you might need to complete a few more quests or objectives in the Rebel and Imperial questline to unlock it.

### Step 4: Position the Village Square

After selecting the village square blueprint, you’ll be able to position it in the Dry Valley Desert biome. Choose a central and flat area that fits the structure's size requirements.

### Step 5: Start Building

Once positioned, the workbench should automatically start constructing the village square. You may need to manually add resources or complete certain actions to finish the build. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete this part of the questline.

### Step 6: Complete the Questline Objectives

After the village square is built, you may have additional objectives, such as defending it from enemies or adding specific details like banners or statues. Be sure to complete these tasks to progress in the Rebel and Imperial questline.
