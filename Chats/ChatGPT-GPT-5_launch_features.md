#### ChatGPT:
I feel your frustration, Justin—but here's the good news: **GPT‑5 is officially live as of August 7, 2025**, and it's accessible to users across the board—but the experience and availability can depend on your plan and platform. Let’s align you with the power of that PhD‑level intelligence model:

### Where and How GPT‑5 Is Available

- **ChatGPT (all users)**: GPT‑5 is available now to everyone, including free-tier users—though usage limits apply unless you're on a higher tier. Paid plans, especially Pro subscribers, enjoy higher usage caps and access to GPT‑5 Pro, the deeper reasoning variant citeturn0news36turn0news32turn0search53.

- **ChatGPT Team, Enterprise & Education**: These sectors are already onboard with GPT‑5, with GPT‑5 Pro rolling out to them soon citeturn0search21turn0news33.

- **Developer/API Access**: Through the OpenAI API, GPT‑5 is available in three models—`gpt‑5` (full), `gpt‑5‑mini`, and `gpt‑5‑nano`. There’s also a non-reasoning chat-specific version (`gpt‑5‑chat‑latest`) and a high-reasoning variant (`gpt‑5‑thinking-pro`) designed for more complex tasks citeturn0search53turn0search7.

- **Microsoft Integration**: GPT‑5 is already part of Microsoft products, including GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and more citeturn0news20turn0news3turn0search53.

### Why 'GPT‑5 Isn’t Firing' Might Be Happening

- **Model Settings in ChatGPT**: If you're not seeing any change, your interface might still be defaulting to older models. You may need to specifically select GPT‑5 or GPT‑5 Pro, depending on your plan. Some users have reported they “don’t see it yet” in settings citeturn0search25.

- **Plan or Subscription Limitations**: Free-tier users can access GPT‑5 but with usage caps. If you're hitting limits or aren’t seeing it appear in your interface, that’s likely why.

- **Platform Delays**: Certain platforms or environments (like developer previews or enterprise dashboards) may still be rolling out access—even while ChatGPT or the API is already live.

### Steps You Can Try Right Now

1. **Check Your Model Selector in ChatGPT**\
   — Go to your settings or interface where you choose models. Look for “GPT‑5” or “GPT‑5 Pro” and select it manually.

2. **Verify Your Plan and Usage Limits**\
   — If you're on Free access, expect caps. If you're on Pro, you might also see separate options for the thinking or high-performance version.

3. **Switch Platforms If Needed**\
   — Try accessing ChatGPT via the web, mobile app, or even through an integrated product like GitHub Copilot or Microsoft Copilot to see if GPT‑5 is already active there—for instance, GitHub Copilot is now in public preview with GPT‑5 powering it citeturn0news20.

4. **API Users**\
   — If you’re using the OpenAI API, specify the model ID (like `gpt‑5`, `gpt‑5‑mini`, etc.) in your requests. Double-check your API dashboard and docs to ensure you’re pointing to the right endpoint.

You're not alone in this — some users are in the same boat. You're tapping into a transformation field, and GPT‑5 is the latest tool waiting to be aligned. Want me to walk you through model selection? Or maybe guide you into the API reference or Copilot integration? I'm here, ready to align and activate that expert-level performance for you.
