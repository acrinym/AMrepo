#### You:
What is the default Mybooklive Ip address?

#### ChatGPT:
The My Book Live does not have a fixed default IP address. Instead, it typically obtains its IP address dynamically from your router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). This means that the IP address is assigned by your router and can change if the device is rebooted or if the router's DHCP lease expires.

To find the current IP address of your My Book Live, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Router's Admin Interface:**
   - Log in to your router’s admin interface.
   - Look for the DHCP client list or connected devices list.
   - Find the entry for your My Book Live. It might be listed as “MyBookLive,” “WD MyBookLive,” or something similar.

2. **WD Discovery Software:**
   - Download and install the WD Discovery software from the Western Digital website.
   - Open WD Discovery, and it should detect and display your My Book Live along with its IP address.

3. **Network Scan:**
   - Use a network scanning tool (e.g., Advanced IP Scanner, Fing) to scan your local network for devices.
   - Look for the My Book Live device in the scan results.

Once you have the IP address, you can access the My Book Live dashboard by entering the IP address into a web browser.

If you encounter any difficulties or need further assistance, please let me know!


#### You:
It keeps getting an IPIPA address, not a valid IP. 

#### ChatGPT:
If your My Book Live keeps getting an APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) address, typically in the range of `169.254.x.x`, it means that the device is not receiving a valid IP address from the DHCP server on your router. This could be due to several reasons such as network configuration issues or problems with the device itself. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check Network Connections:**
   - Ensure that the Ethernet cable is securely connected to both the My Book Live and the unmanaged switch.
   - Verify that the unmanaged switch is properly connected to the router.

2. **Restart Devices:**
   - Restart the My Book Live device by unplugging it and plugging it back in.
   - Restart your router to refresh the DHCP assignments.
   - Restart the unmanaged switch if it has a power source.

3. **Verify Router DHCP Settings:**
   - Log in to your router’s admin interface.
   - Ensure that DHCP is enabled on the router.
   - Check the DHCP range to make sure there are enough addresses available for new devices.

4. **Assign a Static IP Address:**
   - If the DHCP server is not assigning an IP address, you can try assigning a static IP address to the My Book Live.
   - Connect a computer directly to the My Book Live using an Ethernet cable.
   - Configure your computer with a static IP address in the same range as the default My Book Live IP (e.g., `169.254.1.2`).
   - Access the My Book Live dashboard by entering its default IP address (e.g., `169.254.1.1`) in a web browser.
   - In the dashboard, go to the network settings and assign a static IP address within your router’s subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

5. **Reset My Book Live Network Settings:**
   - Perform a reset on the My Book Live to restore network settings to default.
   - Use a paperclip to press and hold the reset button on the back of the device for about 4 seconds. This will reset network settings without affecting your data.

6. **Check for Firmware Updates:**
   - If you manage to access the My Book Live dashboard, check for any firmware updates that might resolve network issues.

7. **Consult the Manual:**
   - Refer to the My Book Live user manual for any specific troubleshooting steps related to network issues.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, it might be helpful to connect the My Book Live directly to the router bypassing the unmanaged switch to isolate the problem. If the device continues to receive an APIPA address, there might be a hardware issue with the My Book Live itself.


#### You:
When giving my computer a static IP will it still connect to my wifi while having that IP? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, your computer can still connect to your Wi-Fi network while having a static IP address. Here’s how to assign a static IP address on your computer for your Wi-Fi connection:

### For Windows:

1. **Open Network Settings:**
   - Right-click on the network icon in the system tray and select "Open Network & Internet settings."
   - Click on "Change adapter options."

   - Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click on "Properties."

3. **Configure Static IP:**
   - Select "Use the following IP address."
   - Enter the IP address you want to use (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
   - Enter the Subnet mask (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
   - Enter the Default gateway (the IP address of your router, e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - Enter the Preferred DNS server (you can use your router’s IP address or a public DNS like `8.8.8.8`).

4. **Save Settings:**
   - Click "OK" to close the TCP/IPv4 Properties window.
   - Click "Close" to close the Wi-Fi Properties window.
   - Your computer will now use the static IP address for the Wi-Fi connection.

   - Click on "Network."

2. **Select Your Wi-Fi Connection:**
   - Select your Wi-Fi network from the list on the left.
   - Click on "Advanced" and then go to the "TCP/IP" tab.

3. **Configure Static IP:**
   - Set "Configure IPv4" to "Manually."
   - Enter the IP address you want to use (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
   - Enter the Subnet mask (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
   - Enter the Router address (the IP address of your router, e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

4. **Save Settings:**
   - Click "OK" and then "Apply" to save your changes.
   - Your computer will now use the static IP address for the Wi-Fi connection.

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that the static IP address you choose is within the same subnet as your router and does not conflict with other devices on your network.
- If your router is set to assign IP addresses dynamically (via DHCP), make sure to choose an IP address outside of the DHCP range to avoid conflicts.
- You can still use other network connections (e.g., Ethernet) with dynamic IPs if needed, as this configuration only affects your Wi-Fi connection.

By following these steps, you should be able to assign a static IP address to your computer while maintaining its Wi-Fi connectivity.
