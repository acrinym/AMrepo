The history of the Lewiston County Courthouse is a tale of resilience and community spirit. The courthouse's story began in the late 19th century when the need for a dedicated courthouse in Lewiston County became apparent. Before the current courthouse was erected, there were several attempts to establish a permanent courthouse in the area, but they were either temporary structures or faced various challenges.

In 1883, the decision was made to construct a permanent courthouse, and the site chosen was the location of a previous courthouse that had been destroyed by a fire several years earlier. The architects selected for the project were renowned for their work in civic buildings, with the lead architect being Jameson Wells, known for his meticulous attention to detail and grand designs.

Construction of the courthouse began in earnest in the spring of 1883, with the local community coming together to support the project. The building was designed in a neoclassical style, with grand columns and a majestic dome, reflecting the importance of the courthouse as a symbol of justice and democracy in the county.

The construction process was not without its challenges, including funding issues and delays due to inclement weather. However, the dedication of the architects, builders, and community ensured that the courthouse was completed in 1886, three years after construction began.

Tragically, disaster struck in 1922 when a fire broke out in the courthouse, destroying much of the building. The community once again rallied together, determined to rebuild their beloved courthouse. Reconstruction began in 1923, with the architects drawing inspiration from the original design but incorporating modern fire-resistant materials and techniques.

The reconstructed courthouse was completed in 1925, and it stands to this day as a testament to the resilience and determination of the people of Lewiston County. The courthouse continues to serve as the seat of justice in the county, a reminder of the rich history and enduring spirit of the community.The history of the Lewiston County Courthouse is a tale of resilience and community spirit.
