# Frog plant identification help

#### You:
So I'm trying to recall what the plant was called that I grew where the leaves appear frog foot like kind of but the most striking appearance-based feature is that the leaves are colored kind of like a frog's skin. Not a tiger or leopard frog. Like a green light green or dull green or dark green, and they're like that. That's why I call it frog plant. Also, at the end of the season, it leaves its stocks standing up and you have to manually remove them every year. It grows very quickly and once it's established it spreads. I don't remember what it's called

#### ChatGPT:
From your description, a few plants come to mind, but the closest match based on:

- **Frog-foot-like leaves**
- **Green patterned foliage like frog skin** (light green + dark green variegation)
- **Stalks that remain standing at the end of the season**
- **Fast-spreading, aggressive growth**

### Possible Matches

#### **1. Ligularia (Farfugium japonicum ‘Crispatum’ or Leopard Plant)**

- **Leaf shape**: Often lobed, sometimes resembling a frog’s foot.
- **Color**: Green with lighter variegation or spots.
- **Growth**: Spreads well once established and sends up stalks.
- **Stalk cleanup**: The flower stalks stay standing unless removed manually.

#### **2. Houttuynia cordata (Chameleon Plant)**

- **Leaf shape**: Somewhat heart-shaped but can look frog-foot-like depending on variety.
- **Color**: Mottled green and yellow, sometimes red (but there are mostly green cultivars).
- **Growth**: Spreads aggressively, considered invasive in some regions.
- **Stalk cleanup**: Dies back leaving upright stems you have to clear.

#### **3. Podophyllum (Mayapple)**

- **Leaf shape**: Umbrella-like but often described as "frog foot".
- **Color**: Green (sometimes mottled varieties like *Podophyllum ‘Spotty Dotty’* resemble frog skin).
- **Growth**: Spreads by rhizomes, leaving stems to clean up each year.

---

### My Leading Guess: **Podophyllum (Mayapple or a hybrid like Spotty Dotty)**

These have that exact "frog foot" leaf look and the unique mottled pattern like frog skin. They also send up flower/fruit stalks that remain until removed.

#### You:
No it has to grow well in Michigan

#### ChatGPT:
Got it—**Michigan hardy** and matches:

- **Frog foot-like leaf shape**
- **Green mottled like frog skin**
- **Spreads fast, comes back every year**
- **Stalks remain upright after season ends, needing manual cleanup**

### Narrowing It Down

In Michigan (Zone 4–6 typically), the top candidates from before shift slightly:

#### **1. Mayapple (*Podophyllum peltatum*)**

- **Michigan Native**: Yes, grows wild in shaded woodlands.
- **Leaves**: Umbrella or frog-foot shaped.
- **Color**: Solid green typically, but hybrids like *Spotty Dotty* have frog-like mottling.
- **Growth**: Spreads fast by rhizomes.
- **Stalk cleanup**: Yep, you have to clear the stems.
- **Flowers/Fruit**: White flowers under leaves, small apple-like fruit later.

#### **2. Jack-in-the-Pulpit (*Arisaema triphyllum*)**

- **Michigan Native**: Yes.
- **Leaves**: Three-lobed, sometimes described as "frog-foot."
- **Color**: Solid green or lightly mottled.
- **Growth**: Naturalizes well in moist shade.
- **Stalk cleanup**: Stalks often remain upright.

#### **3. Houttuynia cordata (Chameleon Plant)**

- **Michigan Hardy**: Yes, but dies back completely to rhizomes and comes back hard.
- **Color**: Mottled green and cream, sometimes red.
- **Leaf Shape**: More heart-like, not truly frog-foot.

---

### Most Likely: **Mayapple (Podophyllum)**

- You said it **spreads once established** (true of Mayapple).
- You said the **leaf looked like frog feet** (Mayapple’s classic umbrella look).
- You mentioned **frog-skin coloring**—the *Spotty Dotty* cultivar of Podophyllum has that exact mottling and grows well in Michigan.

---

Do you remember **if it bloomed with hidden white flowers under the leaves in spring**?\
Want me to **show you Mayapple vs Spotty Dotty pictures side by side** so you can confirm visually?


#### You:
Neither of those have woody stalks that are left over at the end of the year

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, the **woody stalks staying upright** detail changes things a lot. That means it’s likely a **perennial with herbaceous leaves but woody or semi-woody flowering stems**. Combine that with:

- **Frog-foot shaped leaves**
- **Green mottled “frog-skin” coloring**
- **Spreads quickly once established**
- **Stalks don’t fall over naturally—you have to clear them**
- **Hardy in Michigan**

---

### Plants That Fit That Behavior

#### **1. Bee Balm (*Monarda didyma* or *Monarda fistulosa*)**

- **Leaf shape**: Opposite leaves, not exactly frog-foot shaped, but large and slightly lobed depending on cultivar.
- **Color**: Solid green usually, not mottled. (So probably not it.)
- **Woody stems**: Yes, they stay upright all winter.
- **Spread**: Fast by rhizomes.

#### **2. **Joe Pye Weed** (*Eutrochium purpureum*)**

- **Leaf shape**: Not frog-foot-like; more lance-shaped. Probably not.

#### **3. **False Sunflower / Heliopsis** (*Heliopsis helianthoides*)**

- **Leaf shape**: Serrated and broad, not frog-foot-like.
- **Woody stems**: Yes.
- **But**… doesn’t have mottled frog-like leaf color.

---

### A Better Match – **Lobed / Frog-like Leaves + Woody Stems**

There’s one perennial that people often call “frog plant” casually:

#### **Aralia cordata ‘Sun King’** (Japanese Spikenard)

- **Leaf shape**: Big, lobed compound leaves (like a giant frog foot).
- **Leaf color**: Chartreuse green to mottled green when grown in different light.
- **Woody stalks**: Yes, thick upright stalks that stay up after leaves drop.
- **Spread**: Yes, spreads once mature.
- **Hardy**: Yes, good for Michigan shade gardens.

---

### Another Possibility – **Acanthus (Bear’s Breeches)**

- **Leaf shape**: Deeply lobed, looks like stylized frog feet.
- **Leaf color**: Dark green with lighter veins (can look mottled).
- **Woody flowering stalks**: Absolutely, and they stay all winter unless cut.
- **Spreading habit**: Yes, it naturalizes and spreads in a clump.

---

**Question for you:**

- Did the flowers look **spike-like** (tall and vertical) rather than “normal” flowers?
- Were the leaves **soft/herbaceous** but the stalks **hard and persistent**?

If yes, this is starting to sound like **Acanthus (Bear’s Breeches)** or **Aralia cordata Sun King**.

Want me to **pull up pictures of both side by side** so you can confirm which one?\
Also—did it have **purple or pinkish flower spikes**?


#### You:
How about we take the frog foot feature out of the leaf shape and just leave the frog coloring

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect—**frog-like coloring only** (mottled greens, kind of like frog skin), **spreads quickly**, and **leaves woody stalks behind**.

---

### Strong Candidates (with frog-skin color focus)

#### **1. Ligularia (*Ligularia dentata* or *Ligularia japonica*)**

- **Leaf color**: Some cultivars (*Britt-Marie Crawford*, *The Rocket*) have mottled or variegated green leaves that look very “frog skin” when mature.
- **Stalk behavior**: Flower stalks (tall and woody) remain upright through winter and need manual cleanup.
- **Growth**: Thrives in Michigan’s moist soil and partial shade, spreads well once established.

#### **2. Pulmonaria (*Pulmonaria officinalis* a.k.a. Lungwort)**

- **Leaf color**: Dark green with silver/green mottling—**very frog-skin-like**.
- **Stalk behavior**: Flower stalks stiffen and often persist until you clear them.
- **Growth**: Grows fast in shade gardens, forms colonies over time.
- **Extra**: Spring flowers (blue/pink). Many people describe it as looking like amphibian skin.

#### **3. Brunnera (*Brunnera macrophylla* ‘Jack Frost’ or similar)**

- **Leaf color**: Variegated, silvery and green—though usually more silvery than frog-like, unless a green-dominant cultivar.
- **Stalk behavior**: Flower stems stay for a while but are thinner than Pulmonaria.

---

### Most Likely (based on Michigan + frog-skin look + woody stalks): **Pulmonaria (Lungwort)**

- Michigan hardy? **Yes (Zone 3–8)**.
- Mottled frog-skin look? **Yes (classic trait).**
- Spreads? **Yes, quickly by rhizomes and reseeding.**
- Cleanup needed? **Yes, flower stems stay upright until you remove them.**

---

#### Does this sound closer?

Do you remember if it had **blue or pink flowers in spring** (sometimes both on the same plant)? That’s a dead giveaway for Pulmonaria.

Want me to **show you Pulmonaria pictures** so you can confirm visually?


#### You:
Like hibiscus or something

#### ChatGPT:
Ahhh, okay—**woody stalks staying up like hibiscus** but **frog-skin leaf coloring**. That shifts us toward **perennial shrub-like herbaceous plants**, not shade groundcovers like Pulmonaria.

---

### Plants With Woody Stems + “Frog-Like” Leaf Coloring

#### **1. Rose Mallow (*Hibiscus moscheutos*)**

- **Michigan hardy**: Yes, especially *Hibiscus moscheutos* (native to wetlands).
- **Stalk behavior**: Stiff, woody stalks that remain until you cut them in spring—**exactly like you described**.
- **Leaf color**: Some cultivars have mottled or marbled green leaves (*‘Summer Storm’*, *‘Midnight Marvel’*, *‘Kopper King’* has dark veined green).
- **Spreading**: Once established, it spreads out aggressively and comes back bigger every year.

#### **2. Hardy Hibiscus Hybrids (like ‘Disco Belle’, ‘Lord Baltimore’)**

- Similar growth pattern: woody stalks, perennial dieback, fast spread, large flowers, sometimes slightly variegated leaves.

---

### Why This Could Be It

- You specifically compared it to **hibiscus** and mentioned **leaving woody stalks up all winter**—that’s a hibiscus hallmark.
- Some hibiscus hybrids have leaf mottling that can resemble “frog skin” (green with lighter veins or marbling).
- They are **fast growers** in Michigan, often doubling in size each year.

---

### Quick Check Questions

- Did it have **huge flowers** (dinner-plate size) in late summer?
- Were the **leaves heart-shaped with some marbling or vein contrast**?
- Did it die back to the ground in winter but leave behind tall, stiff, brown stalks?

---

If that’s ringing bells, it was probably a **hardy hibiscus (Rose Mallow)** or one of its hybrids.\
Want me to pull up **photos of the main hardy hibiscus varieties** so you can see which leaf pattern matches?\
Or should I also check **other hibiscus-like perennials with mottled foliage** (like Abutilon or certain Althea cultivars)?


#### You:
I had some actual photos of the frog plant flowers as well as the plant and I don't know where it went

#### ChatGPT:
If you had photos, that would be perfect for narrowing this down. Since they’re missing, let’s reconstruct from memory:

---

### Flower Questions (these will narrow it a lot)

- **What color were the flowers?** (White, pink, purple, yellow, etc.)
- **Flower size**: Were they **big like hibiscus** (dinner plate) or smaller clusters?
- **Shape**: Flat & open? Tubular? Trumpet-shaped?
- **Time of bloom**: Early spring, summer, or fall?
- **Fragrance**: Did it smell sweet or earthy?

---

### Leaf & Growth Questions

- Were the **leaves smooth or slightly fuzzy**?
- Did the leaves have **variegation (spots, marbling, lighter veins)** or was it **solid frog green**?
- Did it grow in **full sun or partial shade**?

---

If you can give even **two details about the flower (color + size)**, I can probably lock it down to the exact plant.\
Also, if you’d like, I can show **side-by-side photos of**:

1. Hardy Hibiscus (*Hibiscus moscheutos*)
2. Ligularia (*The Rocket* or *Britt-Marie Crawford*)
3. Pulmonaria (*Lungwort*)
4. Acanthus (*Bear’s Breeches*)

---

Do you want me to **generate images of what your plant might look like based on your description** so you can say “yes, that’s it” or “no, not even close”?\
Or should we **start with hardy hibiscus photo comparisons** first?
