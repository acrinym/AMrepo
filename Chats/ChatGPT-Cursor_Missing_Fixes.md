# Cursor Missing Fixes

#### You:
My Dell Latitude 5440 has no mouse cursor...I didn't bring a usb mouse and have win 10. 

#### ChatGPT:
Well, ain’t that a pickle! Here’s how you can try to get that cursor back without a USB mouse:

1. **Check if the cursor is hidden:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + Delete`, then select `Task Manager`. If you can see the cursor here, it might just be a Windows glitch. Close Task Manager and see if it reappears.

2. **Enable the touchpad:**
   - Press `Fn + F3` or `Fn + another key` with a touchpad icon (depends on your laptop model) to toggle the touchpad on and off.

3. **Use the keyboard to navigate:**
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `control` and hit `Enter` to open the Control Panel.
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate to **Hardware and Sound** > **Mouse**. Hit `Enter`.
   - Use `Tab` and the arrow keys to navigate to the touchpad settings and make sure it's enabled.

4. **Restart the laptop:**
   - If all else fails, a good ol' restart might do the trick. Press `Alt + F4` on the desktop to bring up the shutdown menu, use the arrow keys to select "Restart," and hit `Enter`.

If none of these work, you might need to borrow a mouse from someone nearby or try plugging it into another device to troubleshoot further.Well, ain’t that a pickle! Here’s how you can try to get that cursor back without a USB mouse:

#### You:
Touchpad isn't an option in mouse control panel.....and we tried restarting 3 times now

#### ChatGPT:
Well, that's annoying. Let's try a couple of other steps to troubleshoot this situation:

1. **Check Device Manager:**
   - Press `Win + X` and use the arrow keys to select `Device Manager`, then press `Enter`.
   - Use the `Tab` key and arrow keys to navigate to `Mice and other pointing devices`. Expand it using the right arrow key.
   - Look for your touchpad device. It might be listed as something like "HID-compliant mouse" or "Synaptics/ELAN pointing device."
   - If you find it, press `Shift + F10` to open the context menu and select `Enable` if it's disabled. If it's already enabled, select `Uninstall device`, then restart your laptop. Windows should automatically reinstall the driver on reboot.

2. **Check BIOS settings:**
   - Restart your laptop and press `F2` (or whatever key your laptop uses to enter BIOS) immediately as it starts up.
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate to the touchpad settings in the BIOS. Make sure it's enabled.
   - Save any changes and exit.

3. **Update or Rollback Drivers:**
   - Back in Device Manager, if you see the touchpad device, you can try updating or rolling back the driver:
     - Use `Shift + F10` on the device, then arrow down to `Properties`.
     - Navigate to the `Driver` tab with `Tab`, and select `Update Driver`. If that doesn't work, try `Roll Back Driver` if the option is available.

4. **Run Hardware Troubleshooter:**
   - Press `Win + I` to open Settings.
   - Use `Tab` to navigate to `Update & Security` > `Troubleshoot`.
   - Scroll down to `Hardware and Devices` and run the troubleshooter.

If none of this works, there might be a deeper issue with the touchpad hardware or driver. You might need to wait until you have access to an external mouse to do further troubleshooting or reinstall the touchpad driver manually from Dell's website.


#### You:
Uninstalled driver, just waiting on winders now. 

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, fingers crossed that Windows reinstalls the driver and your touchpad starts behaving itself again. If everything goes smoothly, you should have your cursor back in action once the driver is reinstalled.

If it doesn’t, we can dive deeper into some more troubleshooting. But let's hope Windows gets it right this time!


#### You:
No cursor in windows,. 

#### ChatGPT:
Dang, that’s frustrating. Since the touchpad driver didn’t reinstall automatically, let’s try a few more steps:

### 1. **Force Driver Reinstallation:**

- **Reboot into Safe Mode:**
  - Press `Win + R`, type `msconfig`, and press `Enter`.
  - Navigate to the `Boot` tab using `Tab` and arrow keys, then select `Safe Boot` and `Minimal`. Hit `Enter` to apply and reboot.
- **In Safe Mode:**
  - Sometimes, Safe Mode forces Windows to detect missing drivers. Let’s see if the touchpad works here.
- **If it works in Safe Mode:**
  - Reboot normally by unchecking `Safe Boot` in `msconfig`.

### 2. **Install the Driver Manually:**

- **Use Keyboard to Navigate:**
  - Open `Edge` or any browser using the keyboard (`Win + S` and type "Edge").
  - Search for "Dell Latitude 5440 touchpad driver."
  - Navigate to Dell’s official support page and download the latest driver using the keyboard.
- **Install the Driver:**
  - Once downloaded, navigate to the file using `File Explorer` (`Win + E`).
  - Open and install the driver. Reboot if prompted.

### 3. **Use External Input:**

- If you’re really in a bind, see if you can borrow a USB mouse from someone nearby to make navigating easier while fixing this issue.

If none of these steps bring that cursor back, it might be time to consider reaching out to Dell support for further assistance, as it could indicate a hardware problem with the touchpad itself.
