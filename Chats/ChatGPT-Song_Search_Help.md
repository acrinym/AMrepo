Is calcium/magnesium/zinc pills good for plants if it's crushed up? 

#### ChatGPT:
Great question, Justin. Let’s break this down based on what’s in the supplement.

---

### 📦 Ingredients (Per 3 Tablets)

- **Calcium (Calcium Carbonate) – 1000mg**
- **Magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) – 400mg**
- **Zinc (Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate) – 15mg**
- Other Ingredients: **Talc, Titanium Dioxide, Stearic Acid, Egg Shell, Soy, Maltodextrin, Mineral Oil**, etc.

---

### 🌱 Is This Good for Plants?

#### ✅ **Potential Benefits**

- **Calcium Carbonate** is often used in gardens to:
  - Raise soil pH (reduce acidity)
  - Prevent **blossom end rot** in tomatoes/peppers
- **Magnesium Oxide** can supply magnesium, needed for **chlorophyll and photosynthesis**
- **Zinc Sulfate** is a **micronutrient**, needed in very tiny amounts for plant enzymes

#### ⚠️ **Potential Concerns**

- **Binders and fillers** (talc, stearic acid, titanium dioxide, etc.) are not plant-friendly—**inert but not beneficial**, possibly mildly harmful in excess
- **Eggshell** is okay (adds calcium), but processed eggshell can carry **contaminants**
- **Soy derivatives** may **ferment or attract pests**
- **Mineral oil** and **coatings** could affect soil microbiome if overused

---

### 🧪 Verdict

**Crushed & used sparingly, yes—it can benefit plants.** But only if:

- You mix it well with compost or dilute it into the soil
- You don’t use it frequently (to avoid filler buildup)
- You avoid applying it to seedlings or delicate roots

---

### 🌿 Best Use:

- **Tomato or pepper plants** that need calcium
- **Magnesium-deficient soil** (yellowing leaves between veins)
- Crushed finely and added to **compost tea** or buried near root zones

---

### 💀 Don't Use On:

- **Houseplants**, succulents, or orchids—they're sensitive
- Acid-loving plants (like blueberries)—this will raise pH

---

If you're serious about using human-grade pills for gardening, I’d suggest:
🔁 Switching to **agricultural lime**, **Epsom salt**, or **kelp-based trace mineral powders**—they’re cheaper and tailored for plant bioavailability.
