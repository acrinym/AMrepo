I need a list of movies similar to The Secret that teach things like the power of the subconscious mind, the law of attraction, universal law, etc. like that, that are lined out, or that are kind of like The Secret in a narrative, a sort of tale, a sort of documentary, but not boring.

[audio] Certainly! Here are some films similar to *The Secret*:

[audio] So is there like a secret part two or something like the secret that explores the law of attraction with more depth? Because the law of attraction just—thought brings things, and that's not the entire law of attraction. That's not the only universal law that applies to getting what you want. There's many, many other universal laws that apply to get what you want, and the law of reverse—I can't remember the rest of it—but basically brings you what you think about in reverse. So there's lots of things applicable to the law of attraction that help with getting what you want. And I need to watch the secret documentary again because it really helps every time I watch it.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] For a deeper exploration of the Law of Attraction and other universal laws, consider:

- **"Beyond The Secret"**: A follow-up to *The Secret* that dives deeper into the Law of Attraction and other principles.

These films build on the concepts introduced in *The Secret* and provide further insights into universal laws and personal development.
