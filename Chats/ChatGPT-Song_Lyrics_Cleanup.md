# Song Lyrics Cleanup

#### You:
Can you clean this up and add the parts of the song, don't change anything I just want it to look like a song instead of scattered words. 


I've seen the spark in her eyes, a strength she doesn't need to hide. Confident and grounded, playful and free, there's something about her that speaks to me. She's a force, she's a calm, she's a story untold; a beauty in dresses when the world's feeling cold, she's raised her life with her own two hands, a mother, a maker, a woman who stands. So I'll let it happen naturally, step by step, just her and me. No need to rush, no dreams to chase. I'll savor the moments, let them fall into place. She's amazing, yeah I see, what this could be if we let it grow free. Free She's got the hands of a craftsman, the heart of a queen ; a playful spark and a love for the green. Camping under the Stars, the thrifted treasures she finds, she's a blend of the earth and a curious mind. She drinks her coffee cinnamon sweet, she's got a rhythm that no one can be, knows the science behind the scenes, her minds as sharp as her playful dreams. So I'll let it happen naturally, step by step, just her and me. No need to rush, no dreams to chase. I'll savor the moments, let them fall into place. She's amazing, yeah I see, what this could be if we let it grow free. Free. I'm holding back but not too far, admiring her like a distant star, where she moves I'll follow, we'll take our time, we'll find the rhythm, we'll write the rhyme. I'm not in love, but I feel the pull, her presence makes my world more full; if she's the one I'll let it unfold, a story written in hearts of gold. So I'll let it happen naturally, step by step, just her and me. No need to rush, no dreams to chase. I'll savor the moments, let them fall into place. She's amazing, yeah I see, what this could be if we let it grow free. She's the kind of woman who could be my muse, with every second there's nothing to lose, so here's to the journey whatever may be, letting it happen naturally.
