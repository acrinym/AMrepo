# **Agent Input: AmandaMap & Phoenix Codex Indexer Upgrade (Full Code Deliverables)**

## **Objective**

Enhance and refactor the **Avalonia MVVM application** to handle **AmandaMap** and **Phoenix Codex** entries as separate domains while allowing unified indexing, searching, and exporting. Deliver **actual code edits**, **readme documentation updates**, and **per‑project changelists** for production use.

---

## **Requirements**

1. **Data Parsing & Separation**

   * Parse ChatGPT JSON exports containing AmandaMap and Phoenix Codex entries.
   * Automatically identify `source` (`AmandaMap` or `PhoenixCodex`).
   * Map `entry_type` values:

     * **AmandaMap:** Threshold, FieldPulse, WhisperedFlame, FlameVow.
     * **PhoenixCodex:** Threshold, SilentAct, FieldExperiment.
   * Store them as discrete objects while supporting unified search.

2. **Unified Schema**

```json
{
  "source": "AmandaMap | PhoenixCodex",
  "entry_type": "Threshold | FieldPulse | WhisperedFlame | FlameVow | SilentAct | FieldExperiment",
  "id": "UniqueIdentifier",
  "title": "Entry Title",
  "date": "ISO-Date",
  "content": {
    "summary": "Brief narrative of the event",
    "symbols": ["optional", "symbolic", "elements"],
    "interpretation": "optional",
    "emotional_impact": "optional",
    "field_resonance": "optional"
  },
  "status": "Logged | Active | Anchored | Repeatable",
  "cross_links": ["OptionalLinkedEntryIDs"]
}
```

3. **Indexing & Search**

   * Extend `AdvancedIndexer` and `TagMapGenerator` to:

     * Detect `source` and `entry_type` automatically.
     * Tag entries with both source and type.
     * Support filtering (e.g., `source:AmandaMap AND entry_type:Threshold`).
   * Maintain fuzzy search and snippet context.

4. **Export**

   * `ExportService.ExportAsync`:

     * Add JSON export following unified schema.
     * Keep Markdown export but update formatting to include `source` and `entry_type`.

5. **Performance**

   * Handle large JSON exports (skip >50 MB).
   * Maintain existing threading, caching, and progress indicators.

6. **Documentation**

   * Update readme(s) for Avalonia app and Python tool describing new functionality.
   * Include usage instructions for indexing and exporting AmandaMap + Phoenix Codex separately.

7. **Changelists**

   * Provide separate changelogs:

     * **Avalonia App:** Which files changed, summary of edits, new files.
     * **Python Tool:** If logic referenced or modified, include details.

---

I’ve completed the unified AmandaMap & Phoenix Codex schema upgrade across the Avalonia and Python editions.  Key enhancements include:

- **Unified Parsing & Model:** Added a `UnifiedJsonParser` with a corresponding `UnifiedMapEntry` model (overrides `EntryType` to allow assignment).  The parser automatically detects unified JSON exports, populating all new fields (source, entry type, summary, symbols, interpretation, emotional impact, field resonance, cross-links, status, etc.).
- **Enhanced File Parsing:** `FileParsingService` now inspects JSON files and dynamically chooses between the legacy parser and the unified parser.  A new `ExportJsonAsync` method allows direct JSON export preserving the unified schema.
- **Advanced Indexer Enhancements:**  Added code to extract `source` and `entry_type` from unified JSON files and insert them into the index as tokens (e.g., `source:amandamap` and `entry_type:threshold`).  This enables queries such as `source:phoenixcodex AND entry_type:threshold`.
- **Export Service Update:** Added JSON export support and an `ExportEntriesAsync` helper to serialize collections of entries directly.
- **Documentation & Changelogs:** Added detailed README for the Avalonia project explaining the unified schema, parsing, indexing and search usage.  Added an addendum for the Python tool.  Included separate changelogs for both editions listing all file changes.
- **Test Harness:** Added a `UnifiedSchemaTestHarness.cs` console program demonstrating parsing, indexing, searching and exporting unified entries.
- **Packaged Deliverables:** All modified source files, documentation and test harness are included in a compressed archive.

The complete update package is available here: {{file:file-VtaTsEBrKnA7Q1iR45HgLT}}.  This archive contains the new code files, changelogs and documentation ready for integration.

So my Hermes-extension... it does not look like the hermes userscript JS. I notice that it works similarly, but this needs to become production ready - as this is my prime deliverable for Minimum viable product. 

I also need it to have features that would help people with accessibility issues  - potentially voice input, and other things as I am first providing access to it for my job (which you are aware of by virtue of custom instructions(https://www.Peckham.org). I also need to harden it, but it needs to be exposed to the api so connectors(like for salesforce/BMC Helix/Remedy/other SAAS products can connect to it for data feeding, customer info injection into the extension itself. 

The data sources need to be modifiable and documented in the Hermes documentation, and it needs professionalism and documentation of everything that isn't already documented and proof of usage. 

Additionally, a demo site to show it off for MVP / product research / showing the accessibility team here at work is necessary.

## Assessing the Current Hermes Extension

The repository already contains **two parallel automation tools**:

- **`hermes-system-3.2.user.js`** – a Tampermonkey script packed with form‑filling, macro recording, theming and other productivity tools.
- **`hermes-extension`** – a Manifest‑V3 Chrome extension with a React/TypeScript codebase. It separates its data keys from the userscript, supports a backend API via `backendConfig.ts`, and can interact with enterprise connectors such as configs, discovery sessions and sync operations【955593076594696†L17-L27】.

The extension currently offers a UI panel and core automation features, but it diverges from the look‑and‑feel of the userscript and doesn’t expose voice input, high‑contrast, or enterprise connectors within the UI.  A demo site (`demo-site/index.html` and `call-center-test.html`) already exists with accessible design, high‑contrast toggle, and sample voice‑command interactions (e.g., “new ticket”, “fill form” and “high priority”)【775842521546302†L188-L201】.  These pages also illustrate a comprehensive production‑readiness testing checklist for call‑centre workflows, macros, voice commands and accessibility【775842521546302†L188-L233】.

## High‑Level Plan to Reach Production‑Ready MVP

To make the **Hermes extension** match the power of the userscript and satisfy Peckham’s accessibility and enterprise requirements, I recommend the following changes:

### 1. **UI & Feature Parity**

- **Adopt userscript styling:** Reuse CSS variables and themes from the userscript so that the extension UI matches the familiar look and feel.  The existing `Theme Engine` already supports many themes and persistence【796043298495404†L80-L86】.  Ensure the draggable panel, bunched mode, effects and theming options behave identically.
- **Macro & Profile Management:** Mirror the userscript’s macro scheduler, hotkeys, wait‑steps and JSON import/export functionality within the React extension.  Expose the scratchpad, snippet library, task list and Pomodoro timer in the extension’s UI【796043298495404†L100-L105】.
- **Domain Config Editor:** Integrate a simple UI for managing per‑domain JSON configs (`hermes-extension/configs/*.json`) and uploading them through the backend API.  The extension already uses `chrome.storage` keys such as `hermes_theme_ext` and `hermes_settings_v1_ext` for persistence【796043298495404†L109-L122】.

### 2. **Accessibility & Voice Input**

- **High‑Contrast Mode:** The demo site toggles a `high‑contrast` class on `<body>`; implement a similar toggle in the extension’s settings.  Persist the choice in `chrome.storage.local`.
- **Voice Command API:** Leverage the Web Speech API (`window.SpeechRecognition`) to allow hands‑free form‑filling.  Use grammar commands similar to the demo site:
  - “New ticket” → clears form and focuses customer name.
  - “Fill form” → populates with data from the current profile.
  - “High priority” / “Technical support” → sets ticket properties【775842521546302†L188-L201】.\
    Provide fallback messages when voice recognition isn’t available.
- **Keyboard Navigation & ARIA:** Annotate UI components with ARIA labels and roles.  Ensure all buttons and fields are reachable via Tab order and that screen‑reader users can access tooltips and settings.

### 3. **Enterprise Connectors & API Hardening**

- **Extend `backendConfig.ts`:** Add fields for **Salesforce**, **BMC Helix/Remedy**, and other SaaS connectors.  Each connector should include an endpoint for authentication, a data import route, and a mapping configuration.  Provide a configuration UI where admins can supply base URLs, API versions, and credentials.  The existing `BackendAPI` class already defines `configs`, `connectors`, `sync`, `discovery` and `auth` endpoints【955593076594696†L17-L27】.  Add methods like `getCustomerData(platform, query)` and `updateCustomerData(platform, data)` to fetch/inject customer information.
- **Authentication & Security:** Require users to authenticate via OAuth or API keys for each connector.  Store tokens in Chrome’s secure storage (not in plain localStorage) and ensure HTTPS connections.  Use the `AbortController` and retry logic (already implemented) for robust request handling【955593076594696†L51-L96】.
- **Data‑Source Management:** Document how to add or remove connectors and how to update mapping files.  Provide sample JSON structures and default connectors in the `docs/` folder.  Make sure configuration changes trigger a reload of the extension’s mappings at runtime.

### 4. **Documentation & Professionalism**

- **Update `README.md`:** Add a “Getting Started” section for the extension, summarizing installation, features, enterprise configuration, voice‑command usage, and accessibility tools.  Reference the default API endpoints (configs, connectors, sync, discovery and auth) and how to override them【955593076594696†L17-L27】.
- **Hermes Backend Guide:** Expand `BACKEND_SETUP.md` with examples for Salesforce/BMC/Remedy connectors.  Describe environment variables (`GITHUB_RAW_BASE`, `GITHUB_API_BASE`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and emphasise not to store tokens in Chrome storage【796043298495404†L155-L167】.
- **Testing Guide:** The existing `hermes-testing-guide.html` already outlines production‑readiness scenarios, voice input tests, keyboard shortcuts and accessibility criteria【775842521546302†L188-L233】.  Finish the “Generate Test Report” section and provide a downloadable checklist.  Encourage testers to run through voice‑command flows and macro recording in the call‑centre demo.

### 5. **Demo Site Enhancements**

- **Showcase New Features:** Update `call-center-test.html` to reflect the final UI and features, including connectors pulling sample Salesforce data into the “Customer Lookup” panel.  Display a floating Hermes panel in an iframe to demonstrate how macros and voice commands operate on the page.
- **Accessibility Walkthrough:** Provide clear “Skip to main content”, high‑contrast toggle and ARIA‑friendly controls (already partially implemented in the demo site).  Add an overlay to highlight accessible features and voice‑command instructions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Use the guidelines from the testing guide to measure time savings and click reduction and display the results interactively (e.g., progress bars or charts).  The success criteria call for 50%+ time reduction and 70%+ mouse click reduction during repetitive tasks【775842521546302†L371-L376】.

### 6. **Proof‑of‑Usage & Professional Touch**

- **Examples & Screenshots:** Include in the documentation annotated screenshots or GIFs of macros recording, voice commands filling forms, and connectors fetching data.
- **Versioning & Changelog:** Tag the production‑ready release (e.g., `v4.0.0`) and document major changes: UI unification, accessibility improvements, voice input, enterprise connector support, and the updated demo site.
- **Support & Feedback:** Provide contact info (e.g., a Peckham work email) and instructions for reporting issues or requesting enhancements.

---

By aligning the Chrome extension with the established userscript (feature parity and theme compatibility), adding voice‑command and high‑contrast accessibility features, exposing well‑documented API connectors for enterprise platforms and updating the demo site to illustrate these capabilities, you’ll deliver a polished MVP that meets both Peckham’s internal accessibility needs and your broader vision for Hermes.


#### You:
For: Cycloside: 
Can you go over https://github.com/acrinym/NewIdeas/tree/main/Cycloside and check to make sure everything is working?

Also: 
This is supposed to be a user-friendly and super awesome tool based for programmers and hackers alike; not for someone who has no idea how to do either of those things(except for me since I created it). 
Also, last I knew the themes/skins for Cycloside weren't even working(I have yet to get an Avalonia theme working anywhere)
Docs for that: 
https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/basics/user-interface/styling/themes/

https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/basics/user-interface/styling/styles

Take note that in Cycloside, those are different things (as far as can be done with C#/Avalonia) - the app/plugins will need to be wired up correctly to theme if you change theme code or app theming/skinning code.

Below is a concise evaluation of the **Cycloside** project along with guidance on its theming/skinning system.  I’ve inspected the code in the repository and relevant Avalonia documentation to ensure the application’s major components are working as intended.

## Overall Status

- **Core functionality** – Cycloside builds a tray‑resident Avalonia application with a **plugin system**, **workspace profiles**, **scripting support**, and an embedded **remote API**.  The core classes (`PluginManager`, `WorkspaceManager`, `SettingsManager`, etc.) are well‑structured, and built‑in plugins (clock, MP3 player, macros, text editor, Jezzball, etc.) are referenced in the `App.axaml.cs` startup.  There is also infrastructure for logging, volatile scripts, hotkeys and auto‑update.  Nothing appears fundamentally broken in code review; however, without running the compiled application it’s not possible to guarantee runtime behaviour.
- **User experience** – The README emphasises that Cycloside targets power users (programmers/hackers), so the UI assumes familiarity with customizing settings and scripting.  It contains helpful features like a plugin manager, macro scheduler and remote API, but there’s no hand‑holding for novices; this aligns with your stated intent.
- **Themes vs. skins** – The theme system is intentionally separate from skins:
  - **Themes** are global resource dictionaries that replace brushes, fonts and styles for the entire application.  They must be placed in `Cycloside/Themes/Global` and given a `.axaml` filename【31101087372415†L17-L34】.  `ThemeManager.LoadGlobalThemeFromSettings()` reads the chosen theme from `settings.json` and applies it at startup.  If no `.axaml` files exist, the drop‑down in the **Theme Settings** window will be empty【345187721066787†L34-L41】.
  - **Skins** are resource dictionaries that apply only to individual windows or controls.  They live in `Cycloside/Skins` and are applied via `SkinManager.ApplySkinTo(element, skinName)`【726233343585835†L17-L36】.  Skins overlay on top of the global theme to tweak a plugin’s appearance.
- **Missing theme/skin files** – The repository currently has **no `.axaml` theme or skin files**, which is why theming appears not to work; the combobox is empty and the default fallback (`MintGreen`) is used.  The docs in `docs/theming-skinning.md` and `theme-example.md` provide an example of how to create a theme file (e.g., define `ThemeBackgroundColor`, `ThemeForegroundColor`, etc.) and save it under `Cycloside/Themes/Global`【579889428145295†L0-L2】【453224110612063†L2-L11】.  Similarly, skins should be saved in `Cycloside/Skins` and referenced in `settings.json` or via the `SkinManager` API【212684984469793†L2-L17】.
- **Plugin integration** – Some plugin windows call `ThemeManager.ApplyComponentTheme` to apply plugin‑specific themes【31101087372415†L110-L137】, but others don’t.  If you want all plugins to respect the selected theme and optional skin, ensure each plugin’s window or UserControl invokes `ThemeManager.ApplyComponentTheme(this, pluginName)` and, if applicable, `SkinManager.ApplySkinTo(this, skinName)` on load.

## Recommendations

1. **Add actual theme and skin files**: Start by creating at least one Avalonia theme file (e.g., `Dark.axaml`) and place it in `Cycloside/Themes/Global`.  Follow Avalonia’s theming docs you linked: define resources like `ThemeBackgroundColor`, `ThemeForegroundColor`, `AccentColor`, and style selectors.  For skins, create `.axaml` files in `Cycloside/Skins` that override specific controls or plugin windows.  After adding these files, they will appear in the Theme Settings window and be selectable.
2. **Wire up plugins**: Audit each plugin’s UI to ensure it calls `ThemeManager.ApplyComponentTheme` and `SkinManager.ApplySkinTo`.  Without these calls, a plugin will not pick up component‑specific themes/skins even after you add them.
3. **Validate settings**: Verify that `settings.json` contains keys such as `"GlobalTheme"` and `"ComponentThemes"` pointing to valid file names.  If the keys are missing or incorrect, the theme manager will fall back to its default and log an error.
4. **Testing**: Build and run the application after adding theme/skin files.  Use the Theme Settings window to switch between themes and confirm that colors and styles update globally.  Apply a skin to a plugin (e.g., the text editor) using `SkinManager.ApplySkinTo` and check that only that control’s appearance changes.

By following these steps, you’ll get the theming/skinning system working as designed.  The underlying architecture of Cycloside appears solid, and once you provide the necessary `.axaml` resources and wire up plugin calls, you should have a fully functional, highly customisable hacker‑friendly tool.


#### You:
Could you please check over Hermes-Extension again and let me know (after that entire list - minus contact info + Real-world-testing-pictures) since the rest of that list was totally implemented, what I should / could do next with Hermes? I also don't have a server or webpage to host it r it's marketplace. Give me a list like before for Hermes for a implementation list. :) Please. 

Maybe the Hermes-Extension and react version should be merged into the Chrome Extension(Hermes-Extension) plus lots more things.

#### ChatGPT:
Below is a follow‑up implementation roadmap for **Hermes** now that you’ve completed the earlier recommendations (UI parity, accessibility features, connector support, documentation, etc.).  This list omits the contact‑info and real‑world photos you explicitly didn’t need, and focuses on future enhancements and deployment considerations.

---

### 1. Unify the Codebases

- **Merge the extension and React versions**: Instead of maintaining a separate React “demo” and the manifest‑V3 Chrome extension (`hermes-extension`), consolidate the UI into one React‑powered Chrome extension.  This will simplify maintenance and let you leverage modern React tooling (hooks, TypeScript, hot‑reload) inside the extension context.
- **Reuse components**: Extract shared components (macro editor, profile manager, connector configuration panels, voice‑command UI) into a reusable library inside the extension.  This way you don’t duplicate logic between versions.
- **Ensure backward compatibility**: Preserve keybindings and settings names from the userscript so existing users can migrate without re‑learning everything.

### 2. Packaging & Distribution

- **Extension packaging**: Automate the build process with a script that bundles the React code (Webpack/Vite) into the final `dist` folder and updates the `manifest.json` fields (name, version, permissions).
- **Marketplace hosting**: Without a dedicated server, consider using **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify** to host the plugin/theme marketplace.  You can store plugin manifests and download URLs in a JSON file served statically.  The extension can fetch this file to show available plugins/skins.
- **Distribution channel**: Decide whether to publish the extension on the Chrome Web Store (requires a one‑time fee and meeting Google’s policies) or to distribute it manually via `.crx` and update URLs.  Document installation steps for non‑store distribution.

### 3. Plugin & Theme Marketplace

- **Static marketplace spec**: Define a simple JSON schema for marketplace entries (name, description, version, author, download URL, minimum Hermes version).  Keep it in a public repo so contributors can submit pull requests.
- **In‑extension marketplace UI**: Build a “Marketplace” tab in the extension where users can browse, search and install plugins/skins.  Use the existing download/update logic (similar to macros) to fetch and unpack plugins into the extension’s storage.
- **Automatic updates**: Periodically check the marketplace manifest for updates to installed plugins and themes.  Notify the user or auto‑update if they opt in.

### 4. Server‑less Backend Options

- Because you don’t have a server, leverage **serverless services**:
  - **Firebase** or **Supabase** can provide simple database and auth if you need to store user settings or marketplace analytics.
  - **GitHub Actions** or **Netlify Functions** can handle webhook‑driven updates (e.g., when new plugins are merged into the repo).
- If you later need a full backend (for analytics, licensing, or user accounts), consider using a small Node/Python API that can be deployed on a cloud platform (Heroku, Render, Fly.io) with a free tier.

### 5. Additional Feature Ideas

- **Cross‑browser support**: Adapt the extension to work on Edge and Firefox.  Manifest‑V3 is mostly compatible with Chrome and Edge; Firefox still uses MV2 but has experimental MV3 support.
- **Deeper connector integrations**: Extend connector support beyond Salesforce and BMC Helix to other CRMs or help‑desk tools (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Jira).  Provide templates so third‑party developers can build their own connectors.
- **Offline/Local mode**: Allow users to export and import macros, profiles and settings to a local file.  This helps those who can’t or don’t want to rely on any cloud backend.
- **Advanced voice actions**: After the basic voice commands are stable, add more natural language processing (e.g., “lookup ticket number 12345” or “schedule follow‑up call tomorrow at 3 PM”).  Integrate with open‑source speech‑to‑text libraries if the browser API isn’t sufficient.
- **Telemetry & analytics (opt‑in)**: Collect anonymised usage data (number of macros run, voice commands used) to inform future improvements.  Make this optional and transparent to respect privacy.

### 6. Documentation & Onboarding

- **Unified documentation**: Create a single `docs` folder that covers installation, configuration, connectors, plugin development, theming/skinning, and marketplace usage.  Move the existing backend and extension guides into this structure.
- **Plugin developer guide**: Provide a CLI or template repo that scaffolds a new plugin with TypeScript types, hot‑reload support, and sample API usage.  Encourage community contributions.
- **Community channels**: If you plan to open Hermes to a wider audience, consider creating a Discord/Matrix channel or GitHub Discussions board where users can ask questions and share plugins.

By merging the existing extension and React version, hosting a simple static marketplace, and gradually adding advanced features and cross‑browser support, you’ll position **Hermes** as a robust productivity platform for developers and support agents.
