# Teams: Add Guest to Meeting

#### You:
How do I send out an invite to an EXISTING meeting from Microsoft teams? It's on my calendar and I want to send an invite to a new guest instead of everyone. 

#### ChatGPT:
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Microsoft Teams allows you to add guests to existing meetings and send them invites. Please note that the interface or features might have been updated since then. Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. **Open Microsoft Teams:**
   - Open the Microsoft Teams application on your computer or use the web version.

2. **Go to Calendar:**
   - Navigate to the "Calendar" tab on the left sidebar.

3. **Find the Meeting:**
   - Locate the meeting you want to add a new guest to. Click on the meeting in the calendar to open its details.

4. **Edit the Meeting:**
   - Look for an option to edit the meeting. This might be represented by a pencil icon or an "Edit" button.

5. **Add Participants:**
   - Once you are in the meeting details, there should be a section where you can add participants or guests. It might be labeled as "Participants," "Invitees," or something similar.

6. **Enter Guest Email:**
   - Enter the email address of the new guest you want to invite to the meeting.

7. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the changes you made to the meeting. This might involve clicking a "Save" or "Update" button.

8. **Send Invite:**
   - After saving the changes, there should be an option to send invitations. Click on it to send the updated meeting invitation to the new guest.

Please note that the exact steps and options might vary slightly depending on the version of Microsoft Teams you are using and any updates that have occurred since my last knowledge update in January 2022. If you can't find specific options, I recommend checking Microsoft's official documentation or contacting Microsoft Teams support for the most up-to-date information.

How do I change the time a guest is presenting and send an email invite containing that specified time? 

#### ChatGPT:
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Microsoft Teams doesn't directly offer the ability to change the time of a guest presenter within the Teams interface. However, you can achieve this by modifying the calendar event associated with the meeting and then sending an updated invitation. Here are general steps you can follow:

1. **Open Calendar:**
   - Go to the "Calendar" tab in Microsoft Teams.

2. **Find the Meeting:**
   - Locate the meeting for which you want to change the presenter's time.

3. **Edit the Meeting:**
   - Click on the meeting to open its details, and then look for an option to edit the meeting. This may involve clicking a pencil/edit icon or finding an "Edit" button.

4. **Change the Time:**
   - Adjust the date and time of the meeting to the desired time when the guest presenter will be presenting.

5. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the changes to the meeting.

6. **Send Update:**
   - After saving the changes, there should be an option to send updates or notifications. Click on this option to send an updated invitation to all participants, including the guest presenter.

7. **Review Email Invitation:**
   - Confirm that the email invitation contains the correct details, including the updated time. Microsoft Teams should automatically include the changes in the email notification.

Please note that the exact steps might vary based on updates and changes made to Microsoft Teams after my last training data in January 2022. If you encounter difficulties or if the interface has changed, refer to Microsoft's official documentation or contact Microsoft Teams support for the most accurate and up-to-date information.


#### You:
When sending a meeting invite from Outlook for a teams meeting, does the invite appear on the guest's calendars? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, when you schedule a Teams meeting using Outlook and send an invitation to external guests, the meeting invitation typically appears on their calendars. The behavior may vary slightly depending on the specific settings and configurations, but in general, here's how it works:

1. **Outlook Invitation:**
   - When you schedule a Teams meeting using Outlook, you send a standard meeting invitation through Outlook.

2. **Teams Meeting Link:**
   - The invitation includes a link to join the Teams meeting. This link is usually provided in the body of the invitation or as a separate "Join Microsoft Teams Meeting" button.

3. **Add to Calendar:**
   - When the external guest receives the invitation and accepts it, they can add the meeting to their calendar. The meeting details, including date, time, and Teams meeting link, are added to their calendar event.

4. **Teams Integration:**
   - If the external guest is also using Microsoft Teams, clicking on the calendar event will open the Teams app, allowing them to join the meeting directly from Teams.

It's important to note that the external guest may need to have the appropriate permissions and settings to add the meeting to their calendar. Additionally, the behavior can depend on the email client and calendar system they are using.

As of my last update in January 2022, this is the standard behavior, and Microsoft Teams and Outlook are tightly integrated to provide a seamless meeting experience. If there have been updates or changes to the software since then, it's recommended to check the latest Microsoft documentation or support resources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
