# Michigan Registration Renewal Info

#### You:
So I just started the online renewal of my registration and an electronic registration will not be provided. I live in Michigan

#### ChatGPT:
In Michigan, it is still required to carry a physical copy of your vehicle registration, even though many states are moving towards electronic registrations. When you renew online, you typically receive a paper registration through the mail, which you must keep in your vehicle. Michigan has not yet adopted digital vehicle registration cards, so you’ll need to make sure the physical copy is in your glove compartment or another easily accessible place while driving.

If you need to use your vehicle in the meantime, keep any receipts or temporary proof of registration handy until the official paper document arrives.In Michigan, it is still required to carry a physical copy of your vehicle registration, even though many states are moving towards electronic registrations.
