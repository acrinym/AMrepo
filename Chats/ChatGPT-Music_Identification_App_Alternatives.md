How can you find out where inside outside cats go at night when they're not inside

#### ChatGPT:
To figure out where inside-outside cats go when they’re out at night, you can use several methods that range from high-tech to more traditional. Here are some options to track your cat's nocturnal adventures:

### 1. **GPS Tracking Collars**

- **GPS Collars**: These are small GPS devices that attach to your cat's collar. They can track your cat’s movements in real-time and record where they go. Some popular GPS trackers for pets include:
  - **Whistle**: Tracks your cat’s location and activity through an app.
  - **Tractive**: Offers live tracking and allows you to set a virtual fence that alerts you if your cat leaves a certain area.
  - **Fi Collar**: Known for its long battery life, it provides GPS tracking and can alert you when your cat leaves a designated safe area.
- These devices can be a bit pricey, but they offer precise tracking of your cat’s movements.

### 2. **Radio Frequency (RF) Trackers**

- **Radio-based Trackers** like the **Tabcat** use RF technology to track your cat within a limited range. They don't provide exact locations like GPS but are helpful if your cat tends to roam close to home. You use a handheld device that points you toward the direction of the cat’s location.
- This option is often more affordable and doesn’t require a subscription.

### 3. **Night-vision Pet Cameras**

- If your cat has a favorite exit point, you can place a **night-vision camera** near that area to capture footage of their departure. Cameras like **Wyze Cam** or **Arlo Pro** are affordable and offer decent night-vision capabilities.
- While this won’t track them everywhere they go, it might give you some clues about their usual route or other animals they interact with.

### 4. **Tiny Cat Cameras (Pet Wearable Cams)**

- **Pet cameras** that attach to a collar can record the cat's perspective. Products like the **GoPro Hero (with pet harness)** or **CatCam** record what the cat sees. These can be fun for a few hours, but battery life may be limited for all-night recording.
- The footage can give you an insight into where your cat might be going, though it won’t provide precise location tracking.

### 5. **Glow-in-the-Dark or Reflective Collars**

- While not tracking, a **reflective or glow-in-the-dark collar** can help you visually spot your cat more easily if you decide to go out and look for them at night. This is more about being able to spot them than tracking, but it might help locate them near home.

### 6. **Old-School Detective Work**

- If you have a good sense of your cat's habits, you could try **following them at a distance** for a night. This works best if they have a predictable pattern or if you notice them disappearing around a certain time.
- You could also **talk to neighbors** to see if anyone notices your cat visiting their yard or a particular spot.

### 7. **Tagging with NFC (Near Field Communication)**

- This method involves placing **NFC tags** around locations you suspect your cat might visit. If your cat has an NFC-compatible collar, it can register their presence when they come near one of the tags. This won't give you a map but could help you identify key areas your cat likes to visit.

Using any of these methods or a combination of them can give you better insight into your inside-outside cat’s nighttime adventures.
