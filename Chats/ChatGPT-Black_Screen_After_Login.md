A black screen after logging into Windows can be caused by various issues, including driver problems, corrupted system files, or conflicts with startup programs. Here are several troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue:

### Initial Steps

1. **Restart the Computer**: Sometimes, a simple restart can fix temporary glitches. Since you mentioned the "slide to shutdown" screen appears when you hit the power button, try shutting down completely and then restarting.

2. **Safe Mode**: Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists. Safe Mode loads only the essential drivers and services.
   - Restart your computer and press `F8` or `Shift + F8` before Windows starts to load.
   - Select `Safe Mode` or `Safe Mode with Networking` from the menu.
   - If the black screen does not appear in Safe Mode, it indicates a driver or startup program issue.

### In Safe Mode

1. **Update Graphics Drivers**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select `Device Manager`.
   - Expand the `Display adapters` section, right-click your graphics driver, and select `Update driver`.

   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter.
   - Let the system scan and repair any corrupted files.

### Additional Steps

1. **Perform a Clean Boot**:
   - In Safe Mode, press `Win + R`, type `msconfig`, and press Enter.
   - Go to the `Services` tab, check `Hide all Microsoft services`, and click `Disable all`.
   - Go to the `Startup` tab and click `Open Task Manager`.
   - Disable all startup items.
   - Restart your computer normally to see if the issue is resolved.

2. **Check for Malware**:
   - In Safe Mode with Networking, download and run a reputable antivirus or anti-malware tool to scan your system.

3. **Reset Display Settings**:
   - Press `Win + Ctrl + Shift + B` to reset the display driver. This can sometimes bring the screen back.

### If None of the Above Work

   - Boot into Safe Mode.
   - Press `Win + S`, type `System Restore`, and select `Create a restore point`.
   - Click `System Restore` and follow the prompts to restore your system to a previous point when it was working fine.

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to repair your Windows installation.

3. **Reinstall Windows**:
   - As a last resort, you can perform a clean installation of Windows. Ensure you back up your data before proceeding.

### Preventive Measures
