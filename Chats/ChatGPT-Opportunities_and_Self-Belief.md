(Verse 1)\
Wake up each day with a spark in my eye,\
I’m ready to soar, reach for the sky.\
Everywhere I go, luck seems to find me,\
Opportunities fallin' like fruit from a tree.

(Pre-Chorus)\
Oh, I believe in me, I know I’m on the rise,\
Dreams turn to gold right before my eyes.\
I’m takin’ every chance, livin' bold and free,\
Success is my rhythm, my life's symphony.

Opportunities just fall in my lap,\
Got the Midas touch, no lookin' back.\
Believe in myself, and the world believes too,\
Everything I touch turns to success, it’s true.

Wherever I go, success meets me there.\
Financial gains just come naturally,\
I’m a magnet for wealth, livin' lavishly.
