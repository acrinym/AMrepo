Rewrite with less colorful language, but still the same tone, a teenage maddened male

Alright alright but can we just talk about how one of the colours is orange? I mean, blue, red, green, yellow, all unique and kinda contrasty, but fucking orange? Seriously? First of all orange is an irrelevant ass colour that nobody even knows as "orange", we all call it "red 2" anyways. And like how about a white recruit how about idk maybe any other colour that's not literally the same as the one before because bro who thought pf that like who thought "yeah lets put some red and yeah lets put some yellow and woops guess the next one's orange" like WTF MAN ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS MAN ARE YOU KIDDING ME LIKE BRO WTF MAN YOU DONT EVEN NEED SOME COLOURBLINDNESS SHIT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE FUCKERS LIKE MAN WHAT ARE YOU THST YOU THINK YEAH RED AND ORANGE EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE LIKE NO YOU DIPSHIT LITERALLY NO ONE SEES THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO EXCEPT FOR YOU STUPID FUCKER WITH YOUR MAGIC FUCKING GLASSES LIKE BITCH WHAT ARE YOU LIKE WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TO LET US ALL SUFFER WITH THESE TWO NEARLY IDENTICAL COLOURS WHILE YOU SEE EVERYTHING PERFECTLY WHAT IS THIS MAN WHO.

Alright, alright, but can we talk about how one of the colors is orange? I mean, blue, red, green, yellow, all unique and kinda contrasting, but orange? Seriously? First of all, orange is an irrelevant color that nobody even recognizes as "orange," we all call it "red 2" anyway. And like, how about a white recruit or maybe any other color that's not basically the same as the one before? Who thought, "Yeah, let's put some red and yellow, and then orange"? Like, are you serious? You don't even need colorblindness to struggle to see the difference between those. Who decided that red and orange were different enough for this? Nobody sees the difference between those two except for you with your special glasses. Who do you think you are to make us deal with these nearly identical colors while you see everything perfectly? Orange is the worst color, and it doesn't fit at all. It's not as strong as the rest; it's just a secondary color, basically a knock-off of a cool color, not even a real color on its own. That's like having the aquamarine recruit and also the sky blue recruit, or sunset red and wine red. Do you get what I'm saying? This setup is so dumb it hurts my eyes. Who thought of this? It doesn't make any sense.Alright, alright, but can we talk about how one of the colors is orange? I mean, blue, red, green, yellow, all unique and kinda contrasting, but orange? Seriously?

Yes, that's why I asked to rewrite it with no swearing. :)
