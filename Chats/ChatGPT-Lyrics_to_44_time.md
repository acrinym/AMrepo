Can you make a few verses based on the current world of everyone self obsessed in 4-4 time and make it rhyme? 

#### ChatGPT:
In a world where mirrors talk, all eyes on self,
Snap the pics, chase the likes, mental health on a shelf.
Social streams, vanity's dream, a self-obsessed regime,
Lost in screens, reality teems, life's genuine esteem.

Echo chambers amplify, opinions on display,
Selfie smiles, carefully styled, masking truth's decay.
Measuring worth by virtual mirth, in pixels we confide,
Authenticity denied, as connections subside.

Swipe through faces, replace embraces, with emojis cold,
Self-obsession takes its toll, genuine bonds unfold.
In 4/4 time, a modern paradigm, echoes self-esteem,
Lost in the stream, of a self-obsessed dream.


#### You:
Replace the word "mirth" with something that rhymes with worth that means the same
