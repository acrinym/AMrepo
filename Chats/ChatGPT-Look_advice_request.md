In Michigan courts, you generally **cannot bring your own voice recorder** into the courtroom without permission—using an unauthorized device could be seen as unlawfully recording the proceedings.

### 📜 What Michigan Law & Court Rules Say

1. **Court-Controlled Recording**\
   Only **court-owned or court-approved equipment** may record proceedings. Certified court reporters or operators (with MCR 8.108 certifications) control audio/video recording in trials citeturn0search0.

2. **Media Permission Required**\
   Under Michigan Court Rule 8.115 and SCAO policies, **only credentialed media** may request permission to set up audio or video equipment—and this must be approved by the judge at least **three business days in advance** citeturn0search1turn0search9.

3. **No Personal Devices**\
   Portable electronic devices like personal voice recorders are **not allowed** for recording unless the device is part of court-sanctioned media coverage. In many counties, all personal devices must be silent and not used for recording during sessions citeturn0search2turn0search6.

4. **Privacy & Recording Laws**\
   Michigan’s wiretapping and surveillance laws bar the use of recording devices in any private place without consent. Courtrooms are considered public for auditory proceedings, but still, recording must be court-authorized citeturn0search9.

### ✅ So, what does that mean for you?

- **Personal voice recorders are not permitted** in courtrooms without explicit **judicial permission**.
- If you believe you have a **compelling reason** to record (e.g., for accessibility needs), you'll need to **formally request permission** from the judge—preferably **well before your court date**.
- Otherwise, assume the court will use its own recording systems, and personal recording devices are **off-limits**.

### 🧭 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Reach out to your court’s clerk’s office** today (or as soon as possible) to inquire about requesting permission.
2. **File a written motion or request**, citing the need for accommodation or transparency.
3. **Bring written approval** from the judge if granted, to present at the court entrance.
4. **Keep your devices silent and stored** unless authorized.
