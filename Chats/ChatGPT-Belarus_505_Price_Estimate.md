# Belarus 505 Price Estimate

#### You:
If I was selling a Belarus 505 from 1987 for parts OBO, the hydraulic system for the bucket is not attached but it's on the property if retrieved it would go with it, and I'm not sure what the issue is with it? There's odds and ends that need fixing but all in all it works except for that issue. It's a sturdy motherfucker, if that were to go on fbm, just based on that information what would you quote it at

I mean the thing can take down literal trees by running them over

#### ChatGPT:
🔥 That photo seals it. That **Belarus 505** is a *bare-knuckle brawler* in tractor form. Rusty but righteous. Covered in weeds like a jungle beast just waiting to roar again.

### ✅ Updated Listing Value Based on Image:

Taking into account:

- Visual condition: cosmetic rust, overgrowth, not currently in use
- Appears complete engine-wise
- Big meaty tires still on it (even if worn)
- Bucket frame still attached (hydraulics not connected)
- Field-worthy reputation ("can take down trees" = 💪 selling point!)

---

### 💰 Revised Recommended FB Marketplace Price:

**$1,500 OBO**, with the following logic:

- It *looks like it’s been sitting*, which lowers price a bit.
- But it’s **still intact**, and those Belarus tractors are tanks.
- If the engine turns over or starts, even irregularly? That adds $200-$500 to perceived value.

You could also do:

> **$1,800 OBO** to give hagglers room\
> Drop to **$1,200 if no bites in 2–3 weeks**

Let me know if you want a graphic version or want to use it on Craigslist or TractorHouse too. We can build a “meme ad” if you wanna draw some fast attention.


#### You:
It's 6 ft tall and I would reckon probably a ton and a half maybe? Something like that, I think it could use a pressure washing before it goes on Facebook marketplace, what about you

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin — **pressure washing this beast is 100% worth it** before listing it. That alone could bump perceived value by $200–$400, no joke. Here’s why:

### 💦 Why You Should Pressure Wash It Before Listing

**1. Visibility Sells**\
Buyers want to *see* what they’re buying. Right now, the overgrowth, grime, and surface rust dominate the picture — a wash will show off the **industrial lines**, the **heavy frame**, and the **integrity of the metal** underneath.

**2. Looks Cared For = Higher Trust**\
Even if it's sold *as-is*, cleaning it makes it feel less like abandoned scrap and more like a *retired warrior waiting for a new mission*. That taps into a buyer’s confidence: “This guy didn’t let it rot.”

**3. Better Photos = More Clicks = Faster Sale**\
A clean shot, centered, taken from different angles (especially one from the front/side showing the tires and frame) will **stop scrolling thumbs** on Facebook Marketplace. Add a photo of the detached hydraulic system too.

**4. Price Justification**\
A $1,500 ask with a dusty, weedy pic feels high.\
The *same* price with a cleaned-up, proud old tractor photo?\
Totally reasonable. You may even get competitive offers.

### 🧽 Pressure Wash Checklist

- **Focus on these areas:**
  - Front grill
  - Side engine casing
  - Bucket frame
  - Tires and rims
  - Seat and controls
- Optional: hit the **label decals** with care to make the “505” and “Belarus” pop again.

Let it dry, take 5–6 good daylight photos after it’s washed, and boom—**it’s a $2,000-looking machine** listed for $1,500. They’ll be messaging you same day.

Let me know if you want help crafting an image caption pack or photo angles checklist too. We can make this *hit hard*.
