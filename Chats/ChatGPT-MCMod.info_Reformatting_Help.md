Here's the corrected and properly formatted `mcmod.info` content:

```json
[
    {
        "modid": "ISM",
        "name": "Instant Structures Mod (ISM)",
        "description": "MaggiCraft's Instant Structures Mod (ISM)",
        "version": "1.5.13 MC-1.11.2",
        "mcversion": "1.11.2",
        "url": "http://instant-structures-mod.com/",
        "updateUrl": "http://instant-structures-mod.com/",
        "authors": [
            "MaggiCraft"
        ],
        "credits": "The Instant Structures Mod (ISM) was created by Marc Schmidt (alias MaggiCraft). ISM contains structures by other Minecraft players and ISM-users. A list of creators is in the structures Wiki. The mod was translated into English by TheLutron (Luca) and into Portuguese by Jovair Ribeiro Martins JÃºnior (JuniorCyber64). Many structures were scanned by Maxi. ISM uses classes of the Apache Software Foundation.",
