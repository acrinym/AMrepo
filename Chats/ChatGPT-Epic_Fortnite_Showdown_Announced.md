# Epic Fortnite Showdown Announced

#### You:
I want you to explain a four-person squad like a sportscaster make up random names, and it's the current map and as if it's a championship match between four people with no car power-ups and no cars, just power-ups and guns. I want you to do it as if you are an announcer at a sports game but instead it's fortnite. I really hate sportscasters in the way they ridiculously explain things so I want to see how it would be done in a fortnight match. Just listening to fncs announcers is giving me a headache). 😋 But I want to do it for fun

**Announcer Voice On:**

“*Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Fortnite Championship Finale of the Century! We are LIVE on the ever-chaotic and unpredictable Island map, and boy, do we have a showdown for the ages today. Four of the fiercest competitors—no vehicles, no nonsense—just power-ups, guns, and raw skill! It’s do-or-die time as they battle for the title in this no-holds-barred battle royale! Let’s meet our competitors!*”

**Camera zooms in dramatically on each player:**

“*First up, we have ‘Bulldozer Bob’ from Parts Unknown! Known for his ferocious shotgun skills and his ability to bulldoze through structures like a wrecking ball through wet paper, this man takes no prisoners. Keep your eyes peeled, folks, because when he gets a hold of a pump shotgun, it’s lights out!*

“*Next, we have the slippery ‘Shadow Strike Sally,’ the queen of sneaky eliminations. Sally's been known to disappear in the blink of an eye, only to reappear with a well-timed headshot that sends her opponents back to the lobby, asking what just happened! Will her stealth tactics reign supreme today, or will she get caught out in the open like a deer in the headlights?*

“*Coming in hot, it’s ‘Rocket Ralph,’ who, let’s face it, folks, has never met an explosive he didn’t like. With enough rockets in his loadout to launch a small country, Ralph’s strategy is simple: blow everything up. He doesn’t care if you're hiding in a fully-built tower or behind a single plank of wood—you’re getting vaporized!*"

"Last but not least, we have ‘Sniper Sue,’ with her eagle eyes and trigger finger so quick, you’d think she’s got aimbot on. Whether it’s a 200-meter snipe or a quick no-scope at point-blank range, Sue’s motto is: 'If I can see you, you’re already done for!' No scope, no problem for this marksman."

**Announcer Voice Intensifies:**

“*AND THE MATCH BEGINS! The circle is closing in, and everyone’s already in full survival mode! Rocket Ralph is making the first move—of course, he’s already got the RPG out and is firing shots into Tilted Towers like it’s the Fourth of July! There goes a building, and—OH—Bulldozer Bob just tanked a rocket head-on and shrugs it off like a boss! He’s not backing down! He’s pushing straight towards Ralph with a heavy shotgun in hand, folks, this could get messy!*

“*Meanwhile, Shadow Strike Sally is playing it smart, as always, hugging the shadows on the outskirts of the fight, looking for that opportune moment to strike. She’s got a harpoon gun and a silenced SMG at the ready, and you KNOW she’s waiting for someone to slip up. Is Ralph too focused on Bob? Could it be an ambush? Stay tuned, folks!*

“*WAIT, what’s that?! Sniper Sue—oh my—did you SEE THAT SHOT?! She just took Ralph out with a 250-meter snipe mid-rocket launch! That was COLD. BLOODED. Ralph didn’t even have a second to flinch. This is a true demonstration of what it means to have ice in your veins, folks!*

“*Now it’s down to the final three! The storm is closing in, the tension is thick, and—OH NO! Bulldozer Bob and Sally are going at it! Sally’s using the harpoon gun to yank Bob into the storm, but wait—Bob is building like a madman! It’s wood, metal, brick, all at once! It’s like watching a construction crew on fast-forward! But can he outbuild the storm, folks?! NOPE! Sally’s SMG tears through the walls faster than he can blink, and just like that, Bulldozer Bob is ELIMINATED!*"

"**WE’RE DOWN TO TWO!** It’s Sniper Sue and Shadow Strike Sally. Long-range vs close-range. It’s a classic face-off, and the crowd is going wild! Sue’s perched up on the high ground, and Sally’s sneaking below, trying to close the distance. But what’s this—Sue’s launching herself with a shockwave grenade! She’s in the air, she’s lining up the shot—and OH! OH! IT’S A NO-SCOPE HEADSHOT FROM THE SKY! SALLY IS OUTTA HERE! SNIPER SUE TAKES THE WIN WITH THE FINAL KILL THAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT FOR *YEARS* TO COME!\*

"**WHAT A MATCH!** This was Fortnite at its finest, folks, with zero vehicles, pure chaos, and a champion crowned. Sniper Sue walks away with the victory royale, and a performance that will go down in history as one of the most intense, fast-paced, no-holds-barred championship finales ever!"

**Announcer cools down slightly:**

“*Well folks, if that doesn’t make you want to drop right into a match and start cranking 90s, I don’t know what will. Stay tuned for more championship action, but for now, let’s give it up for Sniper Sue—our unstoppable champion today!*”**Announcer Voice On:**

#### You:
Wait it's not reload, it's the island lol

#### ChatGPT:
**Announcer Voice Intensifies, Take 2:**

"*Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to The Island, where today’s Fortnite Championship Finale is going to be nothing short of legendary! The island is ready, the loot is spread, and we’ve got four of the best players in the world ready to duke it out for ultimate supremacy. No cars, no vehicles, just pure chaos—guns, power-ups, and the will to survive! So grab your slurp juice and settle in, because this is going to be a WILD RIDE!*"

**Camera dramatically zooms in on each player again:**

"*First up, we have ‘Tactical Timmy,’ known for his ridiculous ability to turn every firefight into a 4D chess game. This man doesn’t just build walls—he builds labyrinths! Timmy’s famous for running rings around his opponents while pulling off the nastiest edits you’ve ever seen. Will he outsmart the competition today, or will he be outplayed by the chaos of The Island?*"

"*Next up, it’s ‘Laser-Eye Larry,’ who—if you give him a scoped rifle—might as well be the Terminator. This man sees all, hits all. If you peek for half a second, you’ll be heading back to the lobby faster than you can say ‘Victory Royale.’ Will his precision shooting get him to the end, or will the storm catch him off guard today?*"

"*Now entering the battlefield, it’s ‘Chaos Carla,’ the wildcard of the squad! She’s fast, she’s furious, and nobody knows what she’s going to do next. Explosives? Probably. Impulse grenades? Definitely. She’s the queen of unpredictability, and everyone’s wondering what kind of crazy plays she’s got planned for this match. If anyone can flip the script in an instant, it’s Carla!*"

"*And rounding out our final four, we’ve got ‘Brickhouse Brutus,’ the man who builds fortresses so fast, it’s like watching a construction site on turbo mode! This guy doesn’t mess around. He’s all about defense, strategy, and making you come to him. He’s armed to the teeth and just waiting for someone to poke their head out.*"

**Announcer Leans Into the Mic:**

"*AND HERE WE GO! The Island match is ON, and the storm is already closing in. Chaos Carla makes the first move, throwing impulse grenades all over the place—WHAT IS SHE DOING?! She’s sending herself flying right into the fray, while Tactical Timmy is building so fast, it looks like he’s creating a new condo complex out here! Carla’s closing in, though—this could get spicy, folks!*"

"*WAIT! Laser-Eye Larry just spotted her from across the map—BOOM—HEADSHOT! And Carla’s down just like that! Oh my goodness, did you SEE that snipe?! Laser-Eye Larry is locked in today, folks, and he’s already repositioning to stay ahead of the storm! Is there ANYONE who can get close to this guy?*"

"*Meanwhile, Brickhouse Brutus is playing it slow, already built a fortress bigger than anything I’ve ever seen. He’s set up camp on the edge of the circle, just daring anyone to come close. Timmy’s not taking the bait though; instead, he’s tunneling through the side of a mountain—he’s avoiding the fight altogether! This man plays the long game like no one else!*"

**The Camera Spins Dramatically:**

"*NOW WHAT’S THIS?! Laser-Eye Larry spots Timmy making his way across the high ground, and he’s ready to take the shot, but—NO WAY—Timmy edits a floor so fast that Larry’s shot misses by a hair! Timmy’s not wasting time, folks, he’s cranking 90s faster than I can count, and—oh my goodness—he’s already boxed Larry in! This is a classic Timmy trap, and he’s going for the elimination. Larry is TRAPPED, people! This could be the end for him!*

"*BUT WAIT—Larry manages to slip out with a shockwave grenade! WHAT a play! This is not over yet, folks! Larry’s falling back, but the storm is right behind him! He’s got no time to recover! Timmy’s chasing him down—he’s on the hunt, and here comes Brutus, still hanging out in his fortress, just waiting for his moment to strike! It’s a Mexican standoff, and ANYONE could come out on top!*"

"*THE STORM IS CLOSING IN FAST! Brutus is fortifying, Larry is still on the run, and Timmy is hot on his heels—AND OH NO—THE STORM GOT LARRY! The man couldn’t outrun it, and down he goes! It’s now just Brutus and Timmy, folks, one-on-one for the championship. Will Timmy outmaneuver Brutus’ brick fortress, or will Brutus hold his ground?!*"

"*Timmy’s wasting no time, he’s building straight up, going for the high ground, but Brutus isn’t having any of it! He’s shooting out the builds, and Timmy’s falling, falling, NO WAY—he catches himself mid-air with a perfectly timed wall! This is INSANE! Now he’s pushing Brutus, editing through the builds—Brutus is on the back foot now!*

"*AND THERE IT IS! TIMMY TAKES THE WIN! He outplays Brutus with a final edit, shotgun to the face, and THAT is all she wrote, folks! What a match, what a finish! Tactical Timmy, the mastermind of The Island, claims the Victory Royale and the championship title!*"

"*Ladies and gentlemen, we just witnessed a Fortnite match for the ages! No cars, no gimmicks, just pure gunfights, strategy, and chaos! Tactical Timmy stands tall as your champion, and we’ll be talking about this one for a LONG time. Until next time, this has been the Fortnite Championship on The Island—what a showdown!*"


#### You:
Tunneling? You can't do that in fortnite, maybe I'm missing something lol

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, you're right! My excitement got the better of me there! There's no tunneling through mountains in *Fortnite*, so let me adjust that for you.

**Announcer Voice—Corrected Version:**

"*AND HERE WE GO! The Island match is ON, and the storm is already closing in. Chaos Carla makes the first move, throwing impulse grenades all over the place—WHAT IS SHE DOING?! She’s sending herself flying right into the fray, while Tactical Timmy is building so fast, it looks like he’s creating a skyscraper! Carla’s closing in, though—this could get spicy, folks!*"

"*WAIT! Laser-Eye Larry just spotted her from across the map—BOOM—HEADSHOT! And Carla’s down just like that! Oh my goodness, did you SEE that snipe?! Laser-Eye Larry is locked in today, folks, and he’s already repositioning to stay ahead of the storm! Is there ANYONE who can get close to this guy?*"

"*Meanwhile, Brickhouse Brutus is playing it slow, already built a fortress bigger than anything I’ve ever seen. He’s set up camp on the high ground at the edge of the circle, just daring anyone to challenge him. But Timmy’s not taking the bait—he’s cranking 90s up and around the structure, going for a sneaky side assault! This man plays the high ground game like a seasoned pro!*"

**The Camera Spins Dramatically:**

"*NOW WHAT’S THIS?! Laser-Eye Larry spots Timmy making his way across the builds, and he’s lining up the shot, but—NO WAY—Timmy edits a wall so fast that Larry’s shot misses by a fraction of a second! Timmy’s not wasting time, folks, he’s building even faster now—straight to the sky, trying to take that high ground! This is a CLASSIC Timmy move—he’s got Larry boxed in!*

"*BUT WAIT—Larry escapes with a shockwave grenade! WHAT a play! He’s sent flying, but now the storm’s closing in on both of them! There’s no time to recover! Timmy’s chasing him down—he’s relentless!*

"*THE STORM IS CLOSING IN FAST! Brutus is holding his fortress like a king in his castle, Larry’s trying to outrun the storm, but it’s catching up—AND OH NO—THE STORM TAKES LARRY OUT! Down he goes! And now it’s just Timmy and Brutus, one-on-one for the championship. Will Timmy outbuild Brutus’ fortress, or will Brutus hold his ground?!*"

"*Timmy’s making his move, building higher and higher, going for the ultimate high ground. Brutus is trying to shoot him down, but Timmy’s too fast! He’s editing his way through the sky—AND THERE IT IS! Timmy breaks into Brutus’ stronghold with a perfect shotgun blast, and it’s OVER! Tactical Timmy takes the win with a final, devastating blow!*

"*Ladies and gentlemen, we just witnessed an unforgettable match here on The Island! Tactical Timmy outplayed everyone with his precision builds and lightning-fast edits, claiming the Victory Royale and the title of champion! What an incredible display of skill—this is Fortnite at its finest!*"

"*Until next time, folks, stay sharp and keep building!*"

Now that's more *Fortnite* friendly! Thanks for catching that, Justin!


#### You:
Need a longer match, let's go with two squads and more names that are a bit more nonsensical

#### ChatGPT:
**Announcer Voice—Ultimate Squad Showdown Edition:**

"*Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the most exhilarating Fortnite match of the century! We’ve got two squads, eight competitors, and NO vehicles—just power-ups, builds, and guns. The Island is heating up fast, and it’s all or nothing in this high-stakes showdown. Grab your popcorn and buckle up, because this is going to be a WILD ride!*"

**Introducing Squad One:**

"*First up on Squad One, we have none other than ‘Flapjack Freddy,’ a man known for his love of pancakes and his even greater love of close-quarters combat! Armed with nothing but a shotgun and a dream, Freddy’s a force to be reckoned with. If he gets in your box, you might as well start packing for the lobby!*

"*Next, we’ve got ‘Boomstick Benny,’ who believes every problem in life can be solved with a well-timed rocket. If it’s big, loud, and explosive, Benny is right at home. He’s been known to blow up entire buildings just to eliminate one player—no one is safe when he’s around!*

"*Backing them up is ‘Whispering Wendy,’ the silent killer. You won’t hear her coming until it’s too late. She’s sneaky, she’s fast, and she’s got an inventory full of suppressed weapons. Wendy doesn’t like attention—she prefers to take her opponents out one by one from the shadows.*

"*Rounding out Squad One, we’ve got ‘Bouncy Barry,’ who, let’s be honest, is here to have a good time. Barry’s the king of impulse grenades, launch pads, and all things that make you fly. If there’s a way to yeet himself across the map, you better believe Barry is doing it. Watch out for those surprise sky attacks!*"

**Introducing Squad Two:**

"*Over on Squad Two, we’ve got ‘Turbo Tim,’ the man with infinite energy. This guy doesn’t stop building, doesn’t stop shooting—he’s a Fortnite machine. Tim’s been known to outbuild entire squads while taking them down with pinpoint accuracy. If he gets going, it’s hard to slow him down!*

"*Next, we’ve got ‘Gumbo Gerald,’ whose strategy is simple: collect all the loot. Every. Single. Piece. This man is a loot goblin, and if there’s a gold weapon on the map, you can bet Gerald’s already got it in his inventory. He’s not afraid to share with his squad, though—he’s always well-prepared and fully loaded.*

"*Third in line, it’s ‘Slippery Sue,’ the queen of dodging bullets and edits. No matter how hard you try, you just can’t seem to land a hit on her. Sue’s slippery movement and expert building make her nearly impossible to pin down. Don’t be surprised if she’s right behind you after a sneaky flank!*

"*And last, but certainly not least, is ‘Chuckles Charlie,’ who, well… laughs his way through every fight. Charlie is always in a good mood, even when the storm is closing in, and his carefree attitude somehow makes him dangerous. He’s the kind of player who’ll throw an emote mid-battle and STILL hit you with a sniper shot. Underestimate him at your own risk!*"

**Announcer Voice Ramps Up:**

"*AND THE MATCH BEGINS! Both squads drop into The Island, and it’s immediately a scramble for loot. Turbo Tim is already cranking 90s before anyone else even touches the ground—this guy is fast! Meanwhile, Gumbo Gerald is out there vacuuming up every chest in sight. Seriously, does he even have space left in his inventory? Freddy’s squad is keeping it cool though—Whispering Wendy is already lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.*

"*BOOM! There’s the first shot of the match, and—surprise, surprise—it’s Boomstick Benny launching a rocket straight into Slippery Sue’s build! Sue dodges just in time, but her cover is completely blown, and now Turbo Tim is pushing forward like a bulldozer on caffeine! Tim’s not wasting any time—he’s building a bridge in mid-air like it’s second nature. This is a man on a mission!*"

"*WAIT, WHAT’S THIS? Bouncy Barry just launched himself into the sky like a madman—he’s pulling out all the stops, folks! He’s flying through the air and—OH MY GOODNESS—he lands right in the middle of Squad Two’s base! Barry’s bouncing around like a pinball, throwing impulse grenades left and right. Gumbo Gerald’s entire loot stash is flying everywhere! This is chaos!*

"*Turbo Tim’s trying to wrangle the situation, but Barry’s making a mess of everything! Meanwhile, Whispering Wendy is sneaking her way behind Chuckles Charlie, who’s too busy dancing to notice! Wendy’s lining up the shot… AND THERE IT IS! A clean elimination from Wendy, and Chuckles Charlie is out! No more laughing for him!*"

"*But hold on, Gumbo Gerald just picked up a rocket launcher from the pile of loot that’s scattered everywhere! OH NO—he’s aiming it right at Flapjack Freddy! And BOOM—Freddy gets blown off his high ground! But Freddy’s not out yet—he’s bouncing back with some quick builds. We’ve got a full-on build battle between Freddy and Gerald now! Both players are cranking up to the sky, and it’s anyone’s game at this point!*"

"*BOOMSTICK BENNY IS BACK, FOLKS! He’s firing rockets from afar, just raining destruction down on the battlefield. But Turbo Tim—oh my goodness—Tim just dodged a rocket mid-air and is now charging straight for Benny. This man has no fear! Benny’s trying to reload, but Tim’s already boxed him in—TIM WITH THE EDIT PLAY—AND BENNY’S DOWN!*

"*It’s getting down to the wire now, folks! Bouncy Barry is still bouncing all over the place, but Gumbo Gerald and Slippery Sue are regrouping, trying to hold the high ground. Wendy’s creeping up from behind again—this woman is a NINJA! She’s moving so silently that Sue doesn’t even see her coming! Wendy pulls out the SMG—AND THERE IT IS—Sue is eliminated! Gerald’s all alone now!*

"*The storm is closing in fast, and it’s Gerald versus the entire squad of Freddy, Wendy, and Barry. Gerald’s building like a man possessed, but here comes Flapjack Freddy—he’s charging forward with a shotgun in hand! It’s a showdown, folks! Gerald vs Freddy—AND BOOM! Freddy lands the final shot, and Squad One TAKES THE VICTORY!*

"*WHAT A MATCH! Explosions, high-flying plays, and stealthy eliminations—this was one for the history books! Flapjack Freddy’s squad reigns supreme, with Whispering Wendy’s sneaky plays and Bouncy Barry’s aerial chaos stealing the show. Gumbo Gerald put up a good fight, but in the end, it was Freddy’s shotgun skills that sealed the deal!*

"*Until next time, Fortnite fans, this has been the most chaotic, unpredictable match on The Island! Will we see more bouncy chaos from Barry in the future? Who knows! But for now, Squad One takes the crown!*"

**Announcer Voice Fades Out:**

"*And that, folks, is how legends are made on The Island!*"


#### You:
Oh come on lol try again, names are supposed to be nonsense. Like theb3st0ne, S4ndyL3ttuce, qwertyfred, InstantDesk, Mash3dPotat0es, etc etc

#### ChatGPT:
**Announcer Voice—The Ultimate Nonsensical Fortnite Showdown!**

"*LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, welcome to The Island for the most nonsensical, off-the-rails, absolutely absurd Fortnite Championship you’ve EVER seen! Today, we’ve got two squads, eight players, and more random names than your brain can handle. No cars, no mercy, just pure chaos! Get ready to witness some of the most RIDICULOUS plays in Fortnite history!*"

**Introducing Squad One:**

"*First up on Squad One, we’ve got ‘TheB3st0ne,’ a player so confident, they named themselves before they even picked up a weapon! Known for landing hot in the sweatiest locations and building faster than your internet connection, TheB3st0ne will stop at nothing to prove that their name is more than just bragging rights.*

"*Next up is ‘S4ndyL3ttuce,’ the healthiest sandwich topping on The Island. But don’t let the salad vibes fool you—this player’s got more edge than a butter knife. With fast builds and fast eliminations, S4ndyL3ttuce is out here to toss the competition like a bad salad.*

"*Third, we’ve got ‘InstantDesk,’ who doesn’t believe in furniture you have to assemble—this player arrives fully equipped! Known for quick edits and setting up ambushes faster than you can blink, InstantDesk turns every room into their office. Will they file the competition away into the elimination pile today?*

"*And rounding out the squad, it’s ‘Mash3dPotat0es,’ who may seem soft on the outside, but packs a punch with a sniper rifle. This spud knows how to stay calm under pressure and has the aim to turn any opponent into hashbrowns. Don’t underestimate the power of potatoes, folks!*"

**Introducing Squad Two:**

"*Over on Squad Two, we’ve got ‘QwertyFred,’ the master of the keyboard! This guy types faster than you can blink, edits even faster, and knows every keybinding in existence. QwertyFred is the king of inputting chaos and will build you out of existence before you even hit W!*

"*Next up is ‘XX\_NoScopeLord69\_XX,’ whose name speaks for itself. If it’s long-range, no-scopes, or the most outrageous trick shots you’ve ever seen, this is the player to watch. Expect nothing less than 360-degree spins and eliminations that’ll have you questioning reality itself.*

"*Then we’ve got ‘BananaDart,’ who’s been known to throw bananas with pinpoint accuracy—don’t ask how. Whether it’s grenades or tactical bananas, you can expect them to hit their mark. This player’s all about fruity chaos, and they’ll stick you with a banana bomb when you least expect it!*

"*Finally, we have ‘Wh4ckADuck,’ a player so unpredictable, they’ll have you guessing whether they’re going to build a castle or divebomb into the action headfirst. Wh4ckADuck doesn’t play by the rules—they make their own. Expect quacks of confusion and utter chaos whenever they’re on the field!*"

**Announcer Voice Ramps Up:**

"*AND WE’RE OFF! Both squads drop into The Island like a pack of feral cats, and the scramble for loot is ON! TheB3st0ne is already at it, landing in Tilted Towers with a SMG and flexing those fast edits. Meanwhile, S4ndyL3ttuce is hiding in a bush with a suppressed sniper, ready to lettuce someone into oblivion!*

"*WAIT—S4ndyL3ttuce is taking a shot! BananaDart just peeked their head out and—BOOM—HEADSHOT! BananaDart’s down in the blink of an eye, slipping on their own banana peel! S4ndyL3ttuce draws first blood, and we’ve got our first elimination, folks!*"

"*But don’t count Squad Two out yet—QwertyFred’s already up to his usual keyboard wizardry. He’s building faster than anyone can keep up, cranking 90s and placing traps left and right. TheB3st0ne tries to rush him, but Fred’s edits are faster than a broken Caps Lock key! OH MY GOODNESS—QwertyFred just boxed TheB3st0ne in like an IKEA cabinet, and TheB3st0ne is GONE! That’s one for Squad Two!*"

"*Meanwhile, Wh4ckADuck is on the other side of the map, building—wait, what is that?! Is that a pyramid made of wood?! It’s hard to tell what Wh4ckADuck’s plan is, but this player’s always full of surprises! Mash3dPotat0es is watching from afar with a sniper scope, waiting for the right moment, and OH! THERE IT IS! Wh4ckADuck just got turned into mashed duck by a clean headshot! What an elimination by Mash3dPotat0es—sending the duck flying straight back to the lobby!*"

"*BUT HOLD ON, here comes XX\_NoScopeLord69\_XX! They’re going for the most RIDICULOUS play ever—they’re jumping off the highest mountain on The Island, spinning in the air—360 degrees, 720 degrees—and OH MY GOSH, THEY HIT THE NO-SCOPE ON INSTANTDESK! HOW DID THEY DO THAT?! InstantDesk is down, and NoScopeLord is flexing on them with the emote! What a PLAY!*"

**Announcer Getting Overly Dramatic:**

"*We’re down to the final four, and the storm is closing in! Mash3dPotat0es is holding down the fort, but XX\_NoScopeLord69\_XX is still spinning in circles like they’re auditioning for an Olympic gymnastics team! Meanwhile, S4ndyL3ttuce is lying in wait—AND HERE COMES QwertyFred! He’s building a skyscraper out of nowhere, trying to get the high ground. But Mash3dPotat0es isn’t having it!*

"*OH NO! TheB3st0ne might have fallen, but Squad One’s still in this! S4ndyL3ttuce just bounced QwertyFred off his own build with a shockwave grenade! Fred’s in free fall, and Mash3dPotat0es lines up the shot—it’s all or nothing now! AND BOOM—Fred hits the ground, and Squad Two’s in trouble!*"

"*But wait! Here comes NoScopeLord! This is their LAST chance—they’re going for another wild trick shot! They’re mid-air, spinning again—but NO, S4ndyL3ttuce IS READY! They’re spraying with the SMG and—IT’S OVER! NoScopeLord is down!*
