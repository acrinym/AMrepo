# Runaway Juvenile Record Impact

#### You:
What does being a runaway do to your adult record? If you do it as a child

#### ChatGPT:
Running away as a child **does not create a criminal record that follows you into adulthood**, provided there were no associated crimes (like theft, assault, or drug offenses). Here’s how it breaks down legally and practically:

---

### 🔹 **Juvenile Runaway Status – Not a Crime in Michigan**

In Michigan (and most states):

- **Running away is classified as a “status offense.”**
  - A status offense is an act that is only considered a violation because of the person’s age (like truancy or curfew violations).
  - It is *not* a criminal act.

---

### 🔹 **Effect on Adult Criminal Record**

- **No adult criminal record is created** from being a runaway.
- If the case went to **juvenile court**, it would be recorded in juvenile court records, but:
  - These records are **typically sealed** or **non-public**.
  - They do **not appear** on adult background checks for employment, housing, or college.

---

### 🔹 **Exceptions or Related Issues**

1. If while being a runaway, the child:
   - Committed crimes (theft, vandalism, drug possession, etc.), **those offenses could appear** depending on how the court handled them.
2. **Juvenile adjudications** are not convictions but may appear on internal law enforcement or court databases until sealed or expunged.

---

### 🔹 **Getting Records Sealed or Expunged (If Needed)**

In Michigan:

- Juvenile records can be **automatically sealed at age 18** or by petition to the court.
- If the person had formal juvenile proceedings, they can request **expungement or record destruction** under MCL 712A.18e.

### Summary:

✅ **Being a runaway alone will not follow you into adulthood.**\
🚫 **It does not result in a criminal record.**\
📁 **Any juvenile court records tied to it are private and often sealed.**
