# Gek Merchant on Station

#### You:
Can you describe a scenario with a Gek and describe how they look, and communicate to me? I'm a traveler on a space station, seeking products to purchase with units. 

#### ChatGPT:
Imagine you're wandering the busy corridors of a space station, your eyes scanning rows of vendors, each displaying an array of peculiar wares from all corners of the galaxy. You spot a booth manned by a Gek—compact and froglike, with an unmistakable charm in its earthy-colored skin, dotted with darker, wart-like spots. Its large, luminous eyes gleam with a keen, almost mischievous intelligence, and a pair of short, stubby hands busily adjust a display of goods, some labeled with odd, enticing names in the trade language of the Gek.

The Gek notices your approach and immediately greets you with an enthusiastic squawk, a sound that’s almost like a bird’s call, but rougher and less melodic. It’s followed by a rapid string of high-pitched Gek syllables. Although you don't understand the entire message, your translator kicks in to capture the essentials: "Traveler! Welcome, friend! Finest products here—rare goods, best prices for you, yes!"

With each word, the Gek’s beak-like mouth snaps open and shut, adding a dramatic flare to its communication. The creature has a short, rotund body clad in a tight, metallic jumpsuit decorated with small badges, likely symbolizing its trade affiliations or past achievements. A small emblem of the Merchant’s Guild adorns its chest.

It shifts eagerly, gesturing with one arm to the gleaming rows of items: nanite clusters, valuable minerals, a few mysterious relics. "Units, yes?" the Gek says, its translator picking up on your intent. "Only the best—special offer for you, very lucky, very lucky traveler!"

You get the sense that the Gek is well-versed in the art of salesmanship, always reading travelers for a potential trade. It stares at you intently, those large eyes unblinking, as if sizing up your willingness to part with your hard-earned units.Imagine you're wandering the busy corridors of a space station, your eyes scanning rows of vendors, each displaying an array of peculiar wares from all corners of the galaxy.

#### You:
 *The Gek speaks in Gek, using words I do not understand*... (Speak gek)... 

#### ChatGPT:
The Gek looks at you with gleaming eyes, tilts its head, and begins to speak in rapid Gek:

"Krrraash, voh’dak tee! Shuu valuk, ar’kepa! Na tak, krii’lek, oh velan tre’ruu?"

The sounds are sharp and clipped, like a mix of croaks and whistles, yet filled with a sense of urgency and persuasion. The Gek waves its short arms toward a shimmering device on the counter, something gleaming with a soft blue hue. It makes an emphatic gesture, tapping its beak and puffing up a little as it seems to say, "This is important!"

"Kraa’tek ni ferrok shaa, trodek puu," it adds with an enthusiastic nod, encouraging you to consider the offer further.


#### You:
I speak to the gek about my ship's damaged components, having crashed into the planet I just came from. I ask if it has any repair items... 

#### ChatGPT:
The Gek’s eyes widen as you describe your ship's recent troubles, nodding with a sense of urgency and what might even be a hint of sympathy. It lets out a quick, guttural croak of understanding and starts rummaging under the counter, pulling out items that clink and rattle as they surface.

“Krooo, traveller needs ship parts, yes? Very unlucky crash, very bad luck indeed!” it exclaims, speaking in its raspy, broken Common with a smattering of Gek terms for emphasis. “But… *kreevo* (good fortune), I have best parts! Sealed components, reinforced shielding, and… aha!” it exclaims triumphantly, pulling out a sealed case labeled with a bright Gek symbol. “Specialty fusion coils, all repaired, all perfect!”

The Gek places each item carefully on the counter, eyes flickering between you and its merchandise. “Best quality for long flights, yes! Hull stabilizer, antimatter housing, and *vohr’tas* (essential wiring)! Only a few units, only small price!”

The Gek glances at your ship's direction, as if already picturing it patched up and ready for flight. “You get these, ship flies like wind! Better than new. Gek guarantee!”
