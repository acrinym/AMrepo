I went to an interview today, and I was early. The person doing the interview, likely the manager, responded in an exasperated, irritated manner when told by the secretary why I was there. She seemed to have a negative attitude the whole interview, actually. I'm not sure how it will turn out. In the future, how could I respond to such a display, Ave what could I have possibly done to mitigate such negativity? 

#### ChatGPT:
Dealing with a negative atmosphere during an interview can be challenging, but there are ways to navigate it and maintain your professionalism. In the future, if you encounter a similar situation, consider the following:

1. **Stay Positive:**
   - Maintain a positive and friendly attitude despite any negativity you perceive. Your positivity can counterbalance the atmosphere and leave a good impression.

2. **Remain Professional:**
   - Respond to any negativity with professionalism. Avoid reacting emotionally or taking the negativity personally. Keep your focus on presenting yourself in the best possible light.

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
   - If you notice any exasperation or negativity, you might politely ask if there's anything specific they would like to discuss or if there's any additional information they need from you. This can help address concerns directly.

4. **Express Enthusiasm:**
   - Throughout the interview, express genuine enthusiasm for the position and the company. Your enthusiasm can sometimes influence the interviewer's perception.

5. **Follow Up Positively:**
   - After the interview, send a thank-you email expressing your gratitude for the opportunity and reiterating your interest in the position. This is another chance to leave a positive impression.

In terms of what might have caused the negativity, it's hard to pinpoint without more context. However, it's possible that the manager was dealing with other issues unrelated to the interview. In such cases, it's essential to focus on what you can control – your own behavior and responses.

Remember, interviews are a two-way street, and you're also evaluating whether the company is a good fit for you. If you do receive an offer, consider reflecting on the overall atmosphere and whether it aligns with your expectations for a positive work environment.
