# Parasite Life, Horror, and Fiction

#### You:
Hey GPT; 
Write a poem that does three things - 1. Describes the lifecycle of a parasite, and the effects it has on the CNS. 
2. Add the truth about vampires and the condition they suffer from (polyphoric hemophilia)  as well as the condition that werewolves suffer from. 
3. Speak about the horrible acts that happen in foreign countries that have no freedom. 

Don't use scientific terms and please make it appeal to the younger generation. 

#### ChatGPT:
Creepy crawlies in the dirt,
Some can make us feel quite hurt.
Parasites that latch and cling,
Life cycles they undergo and bring.

From eggs to larvae to adults they grow,
Feeding on blood and flesh, don't you know?
In the central nervous system they'll roam,
Causing damage, making it their home.

But let's talk of creatures that don't exist,
The ones we see in books and flicks.
Vampires with their sharp fangs,
Drinking blood, feeling no pangs.

Polyphoric hemophilia is their curse,
Can't clot, it's like a hearse.
They need fresh blood to survive,
A condition that keeps them alive.

Then there's werewolves, with their howls,
Transforming under the moon's scowls.
It's more than just a curse, you see,
It's a condition that's part of their destiny.

But beyond these creatures and their plight,
There are horrors in the world that aren't right.
Foreign lands with no freedom or voice,
Where people suffer, with no other choice.

Let's open our eyes and lend a hand,
To bring freedom and peace to foreign lands.
We can make a difference, you and me,
And bring hope to those who need to be free.
