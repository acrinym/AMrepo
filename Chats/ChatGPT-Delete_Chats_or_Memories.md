# Delete Chats or Memories

#### You:
Can you delete chats, or just memories? I know you can modifyu memories, like delete, add, etc, but can you do it with chats? Sorry for typos. 

#### ChatGPT:
No worries about the typos! I cannot delete chats or conversations themselves, only the memories I store based on them. I can modify, add, or delete these memories, but the actual conversation history remains intact in the chat system.

If you'd like me to modify or delete any specific memories, feel free to let me know!No worries about the typos!
