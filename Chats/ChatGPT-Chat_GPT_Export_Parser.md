# Chat GPT Export Parser

#### You:
We were just talking about building a chat GPT export data zip file reader and file parser. So let's start that here. I will give you the zip file momentarily with one file of each type including the headers but not the chats, maybe one chat and then the headers and the titles etc etc so you can know exactly what the file types and structures are including the folder structure. And then we can build a GUI

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect. Once you upload the `.zip` file, I’ll inspect the:

- **Folder structure**
- **File types** (e.g., `.json`, `.txt`, etc.)
- **Header formats**
- **Example chat data** (even if minimal)

After parsing the structure and content, I’ll help you build a **file parser** that can read and extract the relevant information (like titles, timestamps, and chat content), and we’ll move on to designing a **GUI**.

Let me know if you want:

- A **desktop GUI** (e.g., Python with Tkinter or PyQt)
- A **web GUI** (e.g., React or Flask/HTML/CSS)

Go ahead and upload the ZIP when ready.Perfect. Once you upload the `.zip` file, I’ll inspect the:
