#### You:
Can you make this better? It kinda seems really random. 

[Verse]
birthday cake pixels flicker, 8-bit blaze,
Party vibes in the matrix, cypher phrase,
Tech-no rave, you're glitchin’ in neon haze,
Through the wormhole, portal spins, time-space craze.

[Verse 2]
Candles flicker, LED shimmer, codes disperse,
Bassline drops, circuits hum, galaxy immerse,
Digital confetti burst, binary curse,
Profiles lit, no escape from the verse.

[Chorus]
Happy birthday, loop on replay,
Glitch in the fabric, night turns to day,
Hologram wishes, trance minds sway,
Celebrate in the glitches, techno ballet.

[Verse 3]
Neural networks toast, silicon cheers,
Electromagnetic wave, erase fears,
USB spirits, eternal in spheres,
Bytes and bits, memories in pioneers.

[Bridge]
Electrons twirl, spark our delight,
Flash drive dreams, gleaming bright,
Interface the party, neon night,
Sync our hearts, wrong and right.

[Verse 4]
Subroutine codes for the ageless soul,
Electric jubilee, lose control,
Harmony in chaos, trance of the whole,
Conscious streams, birthday console.
