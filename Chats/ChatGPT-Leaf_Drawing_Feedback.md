This was supposed to look like an oak leaf but looks more like a orange virtually for something. What kind of leaf does this appear to be? I drew it though within like 5 minutes

Your sketch has a nice organic flow to it, and I can see the intention behind making it resemble an oak leaf. While some of the lobes are less defined, the general shape and vein structure do give off an autumnal leaf vibe.

If I had to compare it to a specific leaf, it looks somewhat like a mix between a **beech leaf** and a **chestnut oak leaf**, mainly because of the elongated form and slightly serrated edges. The shading and color choice also reinforce that warm, fall aesthetic.

Since you did this in just five minutes, it's actually pretty impressive! If you want to refine it, adding more defined lobes and sharper vein details would push it further into a classic oak look. Keep sketching—your instincts are solid!Your sketch has a nice organic flow to it, and I can see the intention behind making it resemble an oak leaf.
