# IRS Warning Whispers

#### You:
Rewrite this about the IRS. 

**[Verse 1]**
He walked among us, with a gentle smile  
But in his eyes, a hidden trial  
His touch so warm, yet cold as ice  
In his embrace, a deadly vice  

**[Chorus]**  
Dark Savior, in the night  
Whispers softly, out of sight  
Children heed his call so sweet  
But beware the shadows at your feet  

**[Verse 2]**  
He speaks of love, of light and peace  
Yet in the darkness, fears increase  
With every step, a silent dread  
For in his path, the lost and dead  

**[Chorus]**  
Dark Savior, in the night  
Whispers softly, out of sight  
Children heed his call so sweet  
But beware the shadows at your feet  

**[Bridge]**  
He knows your heart, he sees your soul  
In his gaze, a void so cold  
A gentle hand, a calming voice  
Yet in the end, you have no choice  

**[Verse 3]**  
Around the world, his message spreads  
But in the night, the terror treads  
His love a mask, his care a snare  
In his shadow, none are spared  

**[Chorus]**  
Dark Savior, in the night  
Whispers softly, out of sight  
Children heed his call so sweet  
But beware the shadows at your feet

**\[Verse 1]**
He walked among us, with love and grace\
A humble heart, a holy face\
His words of peace, his healing touch\
In every life, he meant so much

**\[Chorus]**\
Holy Savior, in the light\
Guiding us through darkest night\
Disciples heed his call so sweet\
But beware the trials he will meet

**\[Verse 2]**\
He spoke of truth, of God's great plan\
Yet in the shadows, rose a ban\
With every step, the Pharisees\
Plotted his death, with such unease

**\[Chorus]**\
Holy Savior, in the light\
Guiding us through darkest night\
Disciples heed his call so sweet\
But beware the trials he will meet

**\[Bridge]**\
He knew the cost, he felt the pain\
In his heart, the world's disdain\
A crown of thorns, a wooden cross\
For our sins, he bore the loss

**\[Verse 3]**\
Betrayed by one, with silver paid\
In the garden, where he prayed\
His love a light, his death a key\
Through his sacrifice, we are free

Guiding us through darkest night\
Disciples heed his call so sweet\

#### You:
Now write a song in a different format about the previous inhabitants of Earth, before this civilization, the civilization of tartaria and their magnificence and advanced technology, and demise because of invaders and tactics

#### ChatGPT:
**Verse 1**
Once upon this ancient land, Tartaria did stand so grand\
Cities shining, towers tall, their wisdom echoed in the hall\
Technology, so advanced, mysteries of the stars entranced\
Harnessed power from the sky, secrets known to only they

**Pre-Chorus**\
In the whispers of the wind, their legends still begin\
Stories of a time before, when Tartaria was no more

**Chorus**\
Oh, Tartaria, land of light\
Your brilliance shone so bright\
But shadows came, with might and spite\
And turned your day into night

**Verse 2**\
In the heart of every town, knowledge passed and shared around\
Energy from earth and air, a marvel beyond compare\
Fields that fed and cities gleamed, life was more than we had dreamed\
Harmony in every part, a testament to their art

**Pre-Chorus**\
In the whispers of the wind, their legends still begin\
Stories of a time before, when Tartaria was no more

**Chorus**\
Oh, Tartaria, land of light\
Your brilliance shone so bright\
But shadows came, with might and spite\
And turned your day into night

**Bridge**\
Invaders from afar did come, with tactics cruel, their hearts were numb\
Destruction rained upon the wise, blinding truths and spreading lies\
The great machines were cast aside, the knowledge lost, the people cried\
And in the ruins, silence fell, where once the light of Tartars dwelled

**Verse 3**\
Ruins now are overgrown, whispers of the past unknown\
Yet beneath the soil so deep, memories of Tartars sleep\
Artifacts of wonder found, hints of what was all around\
In every piece, a story told, of a civilization bold

**Pre-Chorus**\
In the whispers of the wind, their legends still begin\
Stories of a time before, when Tartaria was no more

**Chorus**\
Oh, Tartaria, land of light\
Your brilliance shone so bright\
But shadows came, with might and spite\
And turned your day into night

**Outro**\
But in our hearts, your spirit stays\
Guiding us through modern days\
A beacon from a time gone by\
Tartaria, you’ll never die
