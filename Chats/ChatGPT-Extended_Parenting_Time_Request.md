# Extended Parenting Time Request

#### You:
I'm trying to write a message to my ex wife, my son's mother, who my son lives with except every other weekend, usually when he is with me. She has a history of keeping him away, and my last relationship, she was not cooperative at all. Now I just asked her if I could keep him from the 24th of December to the first of January, new years. She says no because he is the babysitter for her other children. Here's what I have so far, would you rewrite it? I'm not trying to start a fight, but she's hard to work with.  This is it so far: Yes, I understand there's no babysitter. That I get. 
But I also had Christmas Eve plans. With Ayden. 
I'm not sure really how it's compromising if I get less time than we had planned originally, and no holiday, except New Year's which we talked about weeks ago. I tried to plan, and the plans were good. But then they were cancelled. When I tried to replan I was shot down......
I'm trying to work with you so that I get my extra week. It's not fair that because Ayden is the babysitter I don't get extra time. I understand the end of the year is busy. But also, people should understand that you're busy as well.
The same thing happened in summer, I've been discussing the second week all year since summer. Or bringing it up anyway. Originally we were talking about winter break which came and went. And now it's the end of the year... And here I am not getting the second week, in our parenting time order.

Hi \[Ex-Wife's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I understand that arranging childcare can be challenging, and I appreciate your efforts to ensure Ayden's well-being. I want to discuss the possibility of extending my time with Ayden from the 24th of December to the first of January.

I had plans for Christmas Eve that I was looking forward to sharing with Ayden, and I believe it's important for both of us to enjoy meaningful holiday time together. I'm flexible and willing to work on a solution that accommodates Ayden's responsibilities as well as our plans.

I've noticed that planning has been challenging in the past, and I genuinely want to find a way to make it smoother for both of us. I had initially planned for an extra week, and I feel it's essential for Ayden and me to have that time together, especially considering our parenting time order.

I understand that everyone's schedule gets busy, and I want to work collaboratively to find a fair compromise that benefits Ayden and allows us both to enjoy quality time with him. Please let me know if we can discuss this further and find a resolution that works for all of us.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

I've already talked with her about the 24th - 1st and she said no. So I'm wanting to ask her: "how is it fair that my weekends have often ended up with you taking my time because you made plans on my time." She has a historical record of "accidentally planning on my time and requesting me to change it or completely eliminate it. She's also kept him from me on multiple occasions.

Hi \[Ex-Wife's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I've been reflecting on our recent discussion about extending my time with Ayden from the 24th to the 1st, and I understand the challenges with arranging childcare.

I would like to express a concern that has been on my mind. There have been instances where my weekends with Ayden have been affected because plans were made on my designated time, leading to requests for changes or, in some cases, complete cancellations. This pattern has been a recurring challenge for me.

I believe it's crucial for both of us to have predictable and consistent parenting time, as outlined in our agreement. It's challenging for me when plans are made on my scheduled time, impacting the time I get to spend with Ayden. I want to work together to find a fair and reasonable solution that respects both of our schedules and ensures that we both have quality time with Ayden.

I appreciate your understanding and willingness to discuss this matter further.

Best regards,
