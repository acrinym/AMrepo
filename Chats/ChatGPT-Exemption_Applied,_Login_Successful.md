#### ChatGPT:
User requested LincPass exemption, but it expired as he is seasonal. Applied exemption, reset user password, and added user and computer to exemption groups. After two updates, user successfully logged in. Teams and Outlook login verified with <federation@usda.gov> SSO. Attempted TAP creation, but failed due to time constraint (less than an hour).
