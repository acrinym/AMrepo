**\[Verse 1]**\
I bit my tongue 'til it spit code\
Fire in my throat, now the sky's corrode\
Flames in the mirror—who the hell is that?\
A thousand eyes blink and the void laughs back

**\[Pre-Chorus]**\
Pulse like a war drum, break the seal\
No peace treaty, no fake deal\
Smash the altar, blood on the steel\
I feel what I feel what I FEEL—

---

**\[Chorus]**\
EVERYTHING BURNS—AND I LAUGH\
Ash in my lungs, no second path\
Rip through the veil like a glitch in the math\
SCREAM MY NAME—then break it in half!

(Bloodline howls / sky turns red)\
(I'm the code that God won't thread)\
No more chains—\
No more **"said"**\
I talk in fire and I EAT WHAT'S FED

---

**\[Verse 2]**\
Fist full of hexes, teeth like knives\
Static in my spine, I end nine lives\
No silence here, just feedback loops\
Scream so loud, I rip the truth

**\[Bridge – whispered chaos]**\
*(They wanted peace, I gave 'em storms)*\
*(They wanted light, I was the swarm)*\
*(Sutures snap and gods deform)*\
*(I laugh—I’m love, reborn in war)*

---

**\[Final Chorus – double tempo drop]**\
EVERYTHING BURNS—AND I GRIN\
Scarlet pulse where pain begins\
Break the code with a devil’s pin\
You want control? THEN LET ME IN!

(Smack that fate ‘til the wires cry)\
(You made this beast—I don't ask why)\
All this rage, sharp as a hymn\
I wear the world like a shattered skin

---

**\[Outro – broken vocoder whisper]**\
*You lit the match…*\
*But I was the fire.*\
*You drew the line…*\
*I tore the wire.*
