There's one more part to this. I have another idea which involves getting my hypnosis / no linguistic programming / life coach certifications and starting my own business. I could do that anytime it'll only take a couple months of the training to do those and get certified.

What advice do you have about doing these things like starting a business and getting my certification because you have outlined a complete way to get my certification and use the law of attraction at the same time but also I still want to encounter someone or meet someone who can help me make my dreams a reality of my business ideas. What order should I do these in and and how do I use the law of Attraction for both things
