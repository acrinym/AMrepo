What's that quote about having sharks with freaking lasers on their heads

#### ChatGPT:
The quote about sharks with lasers comes from Dr. Evil in *Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery*. It goes:

*"You know, I have one simple request. And that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!"*

This becomes a comedic point when his henchmen inform him that sharks are not available, so they substitute sea bass (albeit "mutated sea bass"). Dr. Evil's disappointment with this substitution adds to the humor of the scene.
