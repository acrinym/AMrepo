# Steam Plugin Enhancements

#### You:
Is there a way to add plugins to the steam app on PC? Like being able to reformat text or having different emojis/emotes/etc.....one more nice thing would be to have a subscribe button on top of mods in the workshop instead of having to open them all.

### 📝 Text Formatting in Steam

Steam supports a limited set of BBCode-like tags for formatting text in profiles, discussions, and comments. Here are some examples:

- **Bold**: `[b]Bold text[/b]` → **Bold text**
- **Italic**: `[i]Italic text[/i]` → *Italic text*
- **Underline**: `[u]Underlined text[/u]` → Underlined text
- **Strikethrough**: `[strike]Strikethrough text[/strike]` → ~~Strikethrough text~~
- **Spoiler**: `[spoiler]Spoiler text[/spoiler]` → Spoiler text (click to reveal)
- **Headers**: `[h1]Header[/h1]`, `[h2]Header[/h2]`, `[h3]Header[/h3]`

For a comprehensive guide on Steam's formatting options, you can refer to the [Steam Community Formatting Help](https://steamcommunity.com/comment/Guide/formattinghelp).

### 😀 Emojis and Emotes in Steam Chat

Steam's chat system includes a selection of built-in emojis, but customization is limited. Some games, like Garry's Mod, offer plugins such as "Gmod Emotes" that allow players to use chat commands like `/wave` or `/dance` to perform actions or display emotes in-game citeturn0search0.

For broader customization, consider using external tools or platforms that support richer emoji sets and integrations.

### 🛠️ Enhancing Steam with External Tools

While Steam doesn't natively support plugins, some third-party tools can enhance its functionality:

- **Steam++**: An open-source tool that adds various features to the Steam client, such as game management enhancements. It's available through platforms like Homebrew for macOS users citeturn0search17.

- **Enhanced Steam**: A browser extension that improves the Steam web experience by adding price comparisons, highlighting owned games, and more.

Please note that using third-party tools comes with risks, including potential security concerns and violations of Steam's terms of service. Always research and use such tools at your own discretion.

### 🧩 Streamlining Mod Subscriptions in the Workshop

Subscribing to multiple mods individually can be tedious. While Steam has introduced a "Subscribe to All" button for collections, it's not universally available for all games or mod lists citeturn0search4.

For games like Garry's Mod, you can create a Workshop Collection to group multiple mods and subscribe to them all at once. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the game's Workshop page.
2. Click on "Browse" and select "Collections."
3. Click "Create Collection" and add your desired mods.
4. Once your collection is set up, you'll have the option to "Subscribe to All."
