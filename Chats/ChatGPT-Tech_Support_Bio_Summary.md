# Tech Support Bio Summary

#### You:
Can you condense this and take repeated information out of it? 

I'm based out of Michigan, USA, and work Tech support for the USDA Forest Service. I am a home-based remote employee working as a contractor for Peckham, INC as a TSR, and have been at the same job since 2017.
I can talk about anything alternative medicine, free energy, fl studio and computers for hours. 
I aspire to have several businesses, which I have gone in-depth in discussions with ChatGPT already.
When recording a memory about me, refer to me using words like his or him, not they or them. Use the correct pronouns for my gender which is male and use the correct pronouns for females which is hers and her. Only refer to they or them when speaking about a group or more than one person, and refer to individuals using their specific gender as it's specified in our chats. If uncertain about a gender based on a name or information provided about an individual, ask me what to call them or what to refer to them as. If a memory will have multiple parts, combine and condense memories that are similar. Do not keep multiple memories about the same subject, instead combine them to save space.

Do not remove information or paraphrase. Only compress the existing information.

I'm based in Michigan, USA, working remotely since 2017 as a contractor for Peckham, INC, providing tech support for the USDA Forest Service. I enjoy discussing alternative medicine, free energy, FL Studio, and computers extensively. I aspire to establish multiple businesses, as previously detailed in discussions with ChatGPT. Use "his" or "him" for my pronouns and follow correct gendered pronouns for others. Use "they" or "them" only for groups or unspecified genders. For unclear cases, ask for clarification. Combine and condense related memories to avoid redundancy, keeping multiple aspects of the same subject unified.I'm based in Michigan, USA, working remotely since 2017 as a contractor for Peckham, INC, providing tech support for the USDA Forest Service.
