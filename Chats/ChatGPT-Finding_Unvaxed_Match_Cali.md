Denmark, including Copenhagen, implemented COVID-19 lockdowns and mandates during the pandemic, similar to many other countries. These measures included:

1. **Lockdowns**: Denmark imposed several lockdowns, closing schools, restaurants, non-essential shops, and other public spaces during peaks of the pandemic.

2. **Mask Mandates**: Masks were required in certain settings, such as public transport and indoor public areas, during specific periods.

3. **Vaccination Passports**: Denmark introduced a "Coronapas" system, which was required for access to certain venues and events. This digital or paper pass showed proof of vaccination, a recent negative test, or recovery from COVID-19.

4. **Testing and Quarantines**: Widespread testing was implemented, and travelers were subject to quarantine requirements depending on their country of origin and vaccination status.

5. **Event Restrictions**: Limitations on gatherings and events were imposed, with rules varying depending on the stage of the pandemic.

These measures were relaxed as vaccination rates increased and the situation improved, with Denmark being one of the first countries to lift most restrictions by early 2022, declaring COVID-19 "no longer a critical threat to society."

Not a division or group of something. Referring to a specific kind of serial killer, but I was referring to whatever show has sicarious in it

Ah, you're referring to the TV show **"Criminal Minds: Evolution"**, which includes references to "Sicarius," a term derived from Latin meaning "assassin" or "murderer."
