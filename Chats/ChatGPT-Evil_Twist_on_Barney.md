# Evil Twist on Barney

#### You:
There's a song on Barney, I'm not sure what it's called, but let's twist it into something evil. Some of the words are "remember please and thank you, cause they're the magic words... " 

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, twisting a Barney song into something sinister—sounds like a fun creative exercise! Let's take those cheerful lyrics and give them a dark twist. Here's an eerie version of "Please and Thank You":

---

**"The Forbidden Words"**

Remember, please and thank you,\
They're the cursed words,\
Whenever they are spoken,\
A darkness will emerge.

Say "please," and something wicked,\
Creeps into your mind,\
Whisper "thank you," and the shadows,\
Wrap around and bind.

They seem polite, they seem so kind,\
But that's how they deceive,\
For once you speak the magic words,\
You never can leave.

So beware of please and thank you,\
And keep your mouth shut tight,\
Or else the words will summon,\
Creatures of the night.

#### You:
Good song. Just the lyrics now lol

#### ChatGPT:
Of course! Here’s a twisted take on the lyrics:

---

Remember "please" and "thank you,"\
They're the cursed words,\
When spoken, shadows gather,\
And haunt in twisted herds.

Say "please," and darkness follows,\
Creeping through the night,\
Whisper "thank you," softly,\
And lose your guiding light.

They sound so sweet and gentle,\
But don’t be fooled, beware,\
For once you say those magic words,\
Evil fills the air.

Beware the words of kindness,\
And keep your mouth shut tight,\
For "please" and "thank you" beckon,\
The creatures of the night.

I hope you enjoy the dark twist!
