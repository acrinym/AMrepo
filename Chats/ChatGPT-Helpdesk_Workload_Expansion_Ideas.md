# Helpdesk Workload Expansion Ideas

#### You:
Hey, what ideas can you think of to give the Customer Helpdesk / computer helpdesk of Forest Service and (USDA CEC) more work? More things to do despite DRP 2.0 / drp 1.0 / EOs? 
Loss of USDA workers all across the agency is impacting our call center, and we prepared for a high-traffic/volume contact time for fire season. 

#### ChatGPT:
Hey Justin 👋 — this is a smart and strategic question. If volume is dropping due to loss of USDA workers or DRP/EO shifts, but you *still need to justify presence and capacity* during fire season prep (or to maintain staffing levels long-term), then let’s get clever and proactive.

Here are **high-value ideas to generate more workload, relevance, and initiative** for the USDA Forest Service/CEC Helpdesk — even in the face of DRP 2.0, DRP 1.0, and evolving Executive Orders:

---

## 🔧 EXPAND SUPPORT RESPONSIBILITIES (Internal Outreach)

### 1. **Create Internal KB Review Projects**

- Offer to **audit and standardize Knowledge Base articles** (Forest Service and CEC).
- Emphasize AI-readiness, clarity, de-duplication, and cross-app compatibility.
- Offer your team as the "cleanup crew" that turns legacy confusion into searchable clarity.

### 2. **Proactive Monitoring Roles**

- Launch a pilot “*Account & Access Health Checks*” initiative.
- Run **weekly checks for expired/expiring accounts**, MFA failures, and orphaned EAuth links.
- Create a “*Digital Readiness for Fire Season*” internal dashboard report for each region.

### 3. **Departmental Liaisons / Embedded Helpdeskers**

- Propose embedded support reps for specific divisions like **Wildland Fire**, **Grants**, or **Environmental Compliance**.
- Could be remote but "tagged" to a region/unit—creates relationship-based workload.

---

## 🔥 SEASONAL & FIRE-SPECIFIC INITIATIVES

### 4. **Fire Season Technology Readiness Push**

- Launch a “**Fire Tech Tune-Up**” campaign: verify dispatch consoles, radios, mobile access, VPN, remote printers.
- Proactively reach out to **incident command centers** or field staff needing secure laptop refreshes.

### 5. **Firefighter Tablet and Mobile Device Support**

- Suggest deployment support for **rugged tablets**, Android/iOS mapping tools, or web-based resources for field crews.
- Create a **“Wildfire Tech Toolkit”** one-pager and support hotline that shows the helpdesk is essential to active season readiness.

---

## 💼 CAPTURE MISSION-CRITICAL SYSTEMS

### 6. **Claim Ownership of “Edge” Systems Nobody Supports**

- These include tools like **INSIGHT, SPPS, TIPS, EMPOWHR, CLER**, or **mid-tier apps** like Reporting Center, Insurance Lines, DPRS.
- Create **Quickstart Guides**, FAQs, and chat scripts to show that you’re “first contact” for those.

### 7. **Application Onboarding Specialist Role**

- Partner with HR or PMOs to **own technical onboarding** for key USDA systems.
- Helpdesk could own EAuth provisioning, system welcome packets, and MFA support for **new hires and rehires.**

---

## 📈 VALUE-ADD SERVICES

### 8. **Self-Service Portal Enhancements**

- Design a **“What can we help with?” AI-driven portal redesign**.
- Use intake forms to reduce misrouted tickets and **offer advanced routing + autofill** options.

### 9. **Train-the-Trainer Sessions**

- Offer **virtual lunch-and-learns** for frequently misunderstood apps or changes due to DRP/EOs.
- Promote yourself as the **human face of tech support**, especially in times of transition.

---

## 🧠 ANALYTICS + FUTURE-READY INITIATIVES

### 10. **Usage Analytics Dashboards**

- Start providing **monthly reports** on login failures, slow system adoption, or access issues by region/team.
- Show your relevance as the *nerve center* of USDA tech operations, not just a reactive call center.

### 11. **AI Assistant Pilot Program**

- Partner with management to test a **secure internal GPT for KB access, application help, or ticket drafting.**
- Offer it as a *helpdesk productivity booster* AND as a user-facing tool that still brings traffic back to your team when escalations happen.

---

## BONUS IDEAS 💥 (Advanced)

- **"Digital Field Kits"** — Offer USBs or downloads of essential apps/tools for disconnected use.
- **Create an NFT (Non-Functional Tech) Report System** — Let users submit “What doesn’t work in your role?” tickets.
- **USDA Digital Buddy Program** — New hires get a helpdesk buddy for the first 30 days.

---

### 💬 Strategic Framing When Proposing These:

- “**We’re ready to evolve with USDA**”
- “**Let us ease the burden on already stretched teams**”
- “**We're the continuity team—stable, consistent, responsive**”
- “**We don't just fix issues—we prevent them**”

Let me know which of these resonate most with what’s *politically possible* at the moment and I can help you flesh out a proposal, internal slide deck, or even email language to pitch it.

#### You:
This is only tier one, you realize. So we mostly put in tickets for people. 

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. Thanks for the clarity. 💡

So since you’re **Tier 1**, your role is primarily **intake, routing, and triage**—not deep fixes or full resolution in most cases. That actually opens up **a different angle** for generating more volume and increasing perceived value. Here's a tailored set of **Tier 1-specific ways to generate more tickets, activity, and justified workload**:

---

## 📥 BOOST TICKET INTAKE & ACTIVITY (Tier 1 Edition)

### 1. **"Tech Health Check" Campaigns**

- Create **seasonal campaigns** that encourage employees to submit tickets for:
  - “Check my EAuth account”
  - “Reset unused logins before fire season”
  - “Update expired certificates”
- Pre-written templates could make users feel safe asking for help before real issues hit.

### 2. **Launch "USDA Digital Spring Cleaning"**

- Encourage folks to send in tickets for:
  - “Remove unused accounts/devices”
  - “Update permissions”
  - “Clean old VPN connections / stale profiles”
- Frame it as: *“Help us reduce clutter before fire season picks up”*

### 3. **Custom Intake Forms That Lead to Tickets**

- Collaborate with internal comms to push a friendly link:\
  *“Not sure what to ask for? Fill out this quick form and we’ll create a ticket for you!”*
- Boom—instant traffic. Especially helpful for less tech-savvy staff.

---

## 📢 PROMOTE YOUR PRESENCE

### 4. **"Call Us First" Reminder Campaign**

- Many users still try to fix stuff themselves or go straight to Tier 2.
- Start a micro-campaign:\
  *“When in doubt, reach out—Call Tier 1!”*
  - Posters
  - Email footers
  - Newsletter shout-outs

### 5. **Office Hours / Open Zoom Sessions**

- Run a **“Drop-In Digital Helpdesk” Zoom** once a week.
- Even if only a few join, you can often **create multiple tickets per call.**
- Helps people open up about problems they forgot to report.

---

## 🔄 EXPAND WHAT YOU ROUTE

### 6. **Adopt More Apps into Your Triage Scope**

- Even if you don’t solve issues in SPPS, CLER, or EMPOWHR...
  - You can **start the ticket, triage, and gather symptoms**.
- Proactively **ask managers what tools people are struggling with**—then route accordingly.

### 7. **Special Routing for Contractors & Fire Crew Tech**

- Offer to be the first contact for **seasonal workers, field crews, or new hires.**
- Especially useful during onboarding times or right before fire season activation.

---

## 📊 TRACK & SHOW VALUE

### 8. **Create “Silent Ticket” Reports**

- Estimate how many calls/emails you **handle but don’t ticket**.
- Then propose *“Let’s create a fast log button”* or “Silent Ticket Generator” to track *touchpoints* that don’t turn into tickets.\
  ➜ This helps **prove Tier 1 is busier than numbers show**.

---

## 🔮 FUTURE-PROOF TIER 1

### 9. **Be the Eyes for Broken Tech Systems**

- Start tracking **repeated symptom patterns** in WFDSS, FSAuth, or ePerformance.\
  → Raise flags to Tier 2 before it becomes a major outage.

### 10. **Offer a “Ticket Concierge” Service for Big Teams**

- Some district or program offices don’t have time to write 5 separate tickets.
- Offer to take **bulk issue submissions via call or email** and create individual tickets for them.
- You become their “digital secretary.”

---

## 💬 Messaging to Justify All This

- “Tier 1 is the front door of USDA Tech.”
- “We aren’t just intake—we’re prevention, pattern recognition, and the pulse of the user experience.”
- “Every ticket we create saves hours for higher tiers.”
