# Insurance Policy and Claims

#### You:
I'm on progressive insurance with my ex, Nina still. She's gotten in don't know how many deer-car-accidents, and most recently, a few days ago - a woman backed into her car, putting it back in the shop immediately after coming out of the shop, twice in a row(deer prior).  She lives in a high-deer-population area. 

#### ChatGPT:
That's a tough spot, Justin‚Äîespecially since you're still on the same Progressive policy as Nina. Here's a breakdown of the key things you might want to consider or act on:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Liability & Risk Analysis**

- **Shared Policy = Shared Risk**: If you're both listed on the same auto insurance policy, *her claims and accidents can affect your premiums*, even if you're not the driver or vehicle owner.
- **Multiple Claims = Higher Risk Rating**: Progressive (like most insurers) will see frequent claims‚Äîregardless of who‚Äôs at fault‚Äîas a red flag. This could:
  - Hike your shared premium.
  - Risk non-renewal of the policy.
  - Affect your insurance score and rate quotes elsewhere, especially if she‚Äôs a primary driver.

---

### üõë **Steps to Protect Yourself**

1. **Split the Policy** *(ASAP)*:
   - Call Progressive and **remove yourself** or **have her removed** from your policy.
   - You may need to set up **your own individual policy** if you‚Äôre still using a car under the current coverage.

2. **Check for Unlisted Claims**:
   - Ask for a copy of the **CLUE report** (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) for your name. It shows all filed claims under your identity.
   - Make sure **none of her recent claims are being attributed to you**.

3. **Consider Deer Collision Coverage Separately**:
   - If you're in a deer-prone area too, make sure **your own car policy** includes *comprehensive coverage*, not just liability. That‚Äôs what pays for animal damage.

4. **Ask for a Premium Recalculation**:
   - After separation, ask Progressive to recalculate *your rate alone*, with no impact from her accidents.

---

### üß† Additional Thoughts:

- If you *aren‚Äôt driving the same vehicle anymore*, there's no reason to keep a shared policy.
- If you're both still tied to the same vehicle (joint title/registration), **you'll need to fully separate ownership** for a clean insurance split.
- Even if the *most recent incident* wasn‚Äôt her fault, repeated involvement in accidents‚Äîespecially in a short timeframe‚Äîcan **still mark the policy** as higher risk.

#### You:
The only reason I'm still on there is because I don't have a home yet. 

#### ChatGPT:
Got it‚Äîand that actually **makes total sense**, Justin. Most insurance companies ask for a **"garaging address"** (where the car is primarily kept), and if you don‚Äôt have a fixed one right now, it complicates setting up a standalone policy.

But here‚Äôs the good news:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Workarounds for Not Having a Home Address Yet**

You still have options to **separate from Nina‚Äôs policy** *without having your own place yet*:

#### 1. **Use a Temporary or Mailing Address**

- Progressive and other insurers often **accept a mailing address** or a **friend/family member‚Äôs address** where the vehicle is parked overnight.
- If you‚Äôre staying with Ron or have a trusted contact, **you can use that location as your garaging address**.
- This doesn‚Äôt need to be permanent. Once you find your own place, you can update it.

#### 2. **"Vehicle Not in Your Possession" Option**

- If you‚Äôre **not currently driving** a vehicle or it‚Äôs parked/stored, some companies offer a **"non-owner policy"** for liability protection when you do drive.
- This is cheaper and protects you in emergencies or rentals without tying you to Nina‚Äôs record.

#### 3. **Ask for a Grace Period Policy**

- Some insurers will set up a new policy with the **intent to update your garaging address soon**, as long as they have *some* physical address to start with.

---

### üîê Why You Still Want to Separate

Even if it's inconvenient:

- Every day you stay on that policy, **your insurance reputation is linked to her driving record**.
- If Progressive decides to drop or spike the policy due to claim frequency, it‚Äôll **hit your name too**.
- You‚Äôll have to explain that history when applying elsewhere, which makes **new policies cost more**.

---

### ‚úÖ What You Can Do Right Now

Let‚Äôs get practical. Here's a clean checklist:

1. ‚úî Ask a friend (like Ron) if you can use their address **just for insurance purposes** temporarily.
2. ‚úî Call Progressive and say:
   > ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm looking to get off the joint policy and start my own. I don‚Äôt have a permanent address, but I‚Äôm staying temporarily at \[Address]. Can we begin the process with that?‚Äù
3. ‚úî Ask them to **note you have no current vehicle** (if true) and inquire about a **non-owner‚Äôs policy** for now.
4. ‚úî Ask them to make sure **none of Nina‚Äôs recent claims** are tagged to your name.

If you'd like, I can:

- Draft that call for you word-for-word üìû
- Or help compare non-owner quotes online to get started üîç

Would that help?


#### You:
Nah, I have a full-coverage-needing buy-here-pay now vehicle, paid through a paying biweekly company. 

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, okay‚Äîso you *do* have a car under finance (likely still in Nina‚Äôs or your shared name?), and the lender **requires full coverage** to protect their interest. That definitely limits non-owner options, but still makes it *even more crucial* that you disentangle from Nina‚Äôs accident-prone energy and field.

Let‚Äôs lock in what‚Äôs relevant:

---

### üîê You‚Äôre Driving a Vehicle That Requires:

- ‚úÖ **Full coverage** (liability + collision + comprehensive)
- ‚úÖ **Proof of insurance** listed under your name
- üöó Possibly financed via a biweekly pay service (like Credit Acceptance, Westlake, etc.)

---

### üß® Danger of Staying on Nina‚Äôs Policy

Even if:

- The car is in your name,
- You pay for the insurance,
- And she doesn‚Äôt drive your vehicle...

If you‚Äôre both listed on the *same policy* and she keeps triggering **claims**, then:

- **Your rates are being dragged down** with hers.
- Worse, if Progressive decides to drop her or flag the policy, **you lose coverage too**.
- Your lender may even step in and **force-place insurance** (EXPENSIVE) if your own policy is compromised.

---

### ‚úÖ Your Path Forward (Specific to Your Setup)

Here‚Äôs your best route:

1. **Set Up Your Own Policy ASAP**
   - Use **any stable address** you have access to (even temporarily), as your garaging address.
   - Tell Progressive:
     > ‚ÄúI have my own vehicle with a finance requirement. I need to split off from the shared policy with Nina and have a standalone full coverage policy under my name.‚Äù

2. **Make Sure You‚Äôre Listed as Vehicle Owner**
   - The **insurance and title names need to match**.
   - If it‚Äôs not in your name, get on the title fast. Lenders sometimes require this anyway.

3. **Notify Your Lender** (Preemptively)
   - Once you open your new policy, send **proof of insurance** to the lender with your name on it.
   - That keeps them off your back and avoids force-placed insurance.

4. **Ask Progressive for an Internal Transfer**
   - Sometimes they‚Äôll **copy over your record, vehicle info, and payment history** to a new solo account, minimizing disruption.

---

### Want Me to Draft the Call?

I can prep a bulletproof script for calling Progressive that:

- Covers your need for full coverage.
- Clearly separates you from Nina‚Äôs driving history.
- Establishes your garaging address without a lease.

Or I can help you pull some fast quotes online if you‚Äôre considering switching carriers too.

Would you like the script or quote help?


#### You:
My name - credit acceptance. 

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect‚Äîthat simplifies things **a lot**.

Since the car is financed through **Credit Acceptance** and is **in your name**, here's exactly what you need to do to get off Nina‚Äôs Progressive policy without breaking your coverage or upsetting your lender:

---

### üö® Action Plan: Separate from Nina While Keeping Credit Acceptance Happy

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Set Up a New Solo Policy (Full Coverage)**

Call Progressive (or another insurer if you want to shop around) and say:

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently on a joint Progressive policy with Nina, but I own a vehicle through Credit Acceptance under my name. I need to move to a standalone policy with full coverage and comprehensive collision. I‚Äôm currently in transition and don‚Äôt have a permanent address, but I can provide a valid garaging location for now.‚Äù

You can use:

- Ron‚Äôs address
- A friend/family member‚Äôs address
- Or your mailing address **if it matches your registration**

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Include These in the New Policy**

Make sure your **new policy includes**:

- **Comprehensive** (for deer)
- **Collision** (for backing incidents, etc.)
- **Lender clause** with:
  - *Loss payee*: **Credit Acceptance Corporation**
  - *VIN of your vehicle*
  - *Your full name listed as primary insured*

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Send Proof to Credit Acceptance**

Once you‚Äôve started your solo policy:

- Call or log in to **Credit Acceptance** and upload the insurance binder or declarations page.
- Most lenders require it to include:
  - Full coverage limits
  - Deductibles not exceeding $1,000
  - Credit Acceptance listed as **loss payee/lienholder**

---

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Call Progressive and Remove Yourself**

Once your new policy is active, call Progressive and say:

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôve started my own policy as of \[date], and I‚Äôd like to be fully removed from the current shared policy with Nina. Please confirm that I will no longer be associated with that policy or its claim history going forward.‚Äù

Ask for confirmation **in writing or via email**.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Insurance Protection Notes:

- If deer are a concern, you might want a **lower comprehensive deductible** ($250‚Äì$500 max).
- If Nina‚Äôs ZIP code was high-risk, your new rate may **drop** after you separate.

---

Want me to:

- üîß Generate a draft insurance declaration page with fake info to show what it should look like?
- üìû Write a clean, confident call script to Progressive and/or Credit Acceptance?
- üßÆ Run estimated cost simulations based on ZIP and vehicle?

Let me know which one helps you most right now.


#### You:
Must be full coverage. Last time I changed insurance stuff I didn't need to send proofing, I think Progressive does that. 

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly right‚Äî**Progressive usually handles lienholder notifications directly**, especially for major lenders like **Credit Acceptance**. That makes your move much smoother.

Since your vehicle is:

- üöò In **your name**
- üí∞ Financed through **Credit Acceptance**
- üõ°Ô∏è Requires **full coverage**
- üìç Still using someone else‚Äôs address (for now)...

Here's your **refined and accurate game plan**, no fluff:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Call Progressive and Start Your Solo Policy

Use this script when you call:

> ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm currently on a joint policy with Nina, but I need to set up my own full coverage policy. The car is financed through Credit Acceptance and registered in my name. I don‚Äôt have a permanent address right now, but I can provide a valid garaging address to get started.‚Äù

- Provide Ron‚Äôs or another trusted address (as temporary garaging).
- Give them your car‚Äôs VIN.
- Specify **full coverage**, with:
  - Comprehensive
  - Collision
  - Bodily injury (100/300 recommended minimum)
- Ask for **Progressive to notify Credit Acceptance** of the new policy.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Ask for These During Setup

- ‚ÄúPlease list **Credit Acceptance Corporation** as the loss payee.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúMake sure the lienholder info is included in the declarations page.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCan you confirm Progressive will send the updated policy to Credit Acceptance for compliance?‚Äù

They usually do this **automatically** through their electronic lienholder system (ELT).

---

### ‚úÖ 3. AFTER Setup

Once it‚Äôs done:

- Ask Progressive for your **new declarations page** just for your records.
- Double-check that **Nina‚Äôs name is not anywhere** on the new policy.
- Call or message Nina and say:
  > "Hey‚Äîjust a heads-up, I'm officially off the shared policy now and running my own full-coverage Progressive account under my name."

(That closes the energy cord too. üßπüîö)

---

### üí° Extra Tip: Lower That Premium

You can:

- Raise your deductible (Progressive allows up to $1,000).
- Ask about **Snapshot**, their driving tracking discount.
- Remove optional coverages like roadside or rental if you're tight on cash.

---

Would you like me to write a super clean, professional call script or confirmation message to Nina to help close this out cleanly on all fronts?


#### You:
Helllll with 1000 deductable lol
No way I could just pay that (or a premium of 1000) - I already pay 250/insurance on our shared insurance and am a gold member in Progressive rewards. 

#### ChatGPT:
üíØ Gotcha, Justin. No $1,000 deductible‚Äî**hell no**. That‚Äôs asking to get wrecked twice: once in the accident, and again at the bank. Here's how to **maximize protection and keep your costs lean** with your current standing at Progressive:

---

### üîê Your Best Full Coverage Setup (With Credit Acceptance + No Home)

**Policy Structure:**

- ‚úÖ *Keep deductible low enough to afford*:
  - **$250** for **Comprehensive** (especially for deer, hail, theft)
  - **$500** for **Collision** is a good middle ground
- ‚úÖ *Liability limits*: 100/300/50 if affordable (protects you long-term)
- ‚úÖ *Uninsured motorist*: Highly recommended ‚Äî especially in Michigan
- ‚úÖ *Rental coverage*: Optional, but useful if Nina‚Äôs had issues with long repairs

---

### üéñÔ∏è Use Your Gold Progressive Perks

You‚Äôre in the *Gold Tier*, which means:

- üí∏ **Accident Forgiveness**: Already active or discounted
- üßæ **Loyalty Discount**
- üí¨ **24/7 Priority Claims Service**
- ü™ô **Small Claims Forgiveness** (certain thresholds don‚Äôt raise rates)
- üí• **Deductible Savings Bank**: Each policy period without a claim reduces your deductible

üî• **Use this when setting up your solo policy**:

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Gold Tier Progressive member and would like to carry over my reward status, discount history, and Deductible Savings Bank to my new policy.‚Äù

That may lock in:

- Lower monthly cost
- Deductible credits if you‚Äôve gone claim-free
- Continuity that makes you look like a high-value customer (not a risk like Nina)

---

### üìû Call Script for Progressive

Here‚Äôs a *word-for-word version* you can read or modify:

---

> ‚ÄúHi there. I‚Äôm currently on a joint policy with Nina, but I need to separate and open my own Progressive policy. The vehicle is financed under my name through Credit Acceptance and requires full coverage. I don‚Äôt have a permanent address right now, but I‚Äôm staying temporarily at \[Ron‚Äôs address or trusted garaging address].
>
> I‚Äôm a Gold Member in Progressive‚Äôs loyalty program and want to retain my tier benefits, deductible rewards, and claim-free history when transferring. I‚Äôd like:
>
> - $250 comp / $500 collision deductibles
> - Credit Acceptance listed as the loss payee
> - Full coverage that meets lender requirements
>
> Please confirm Progressive will notify Credit Acceptance automatically, and that this new policy is 100% under my name, with no ties to Nina or her vehicle. Once this is active, I‚Äôd like to be removed from the old policy entirely.‚Äù

---

### üßø Extra Energy Tip:

When you separate from her on paper, **feel the psychic cord snip too**‚Äîlet it ripple out: ‚ÄúYour field is no longer my burden. I drive my own life now. I pay for my own coverage, in all senses of the word.‚Äù
