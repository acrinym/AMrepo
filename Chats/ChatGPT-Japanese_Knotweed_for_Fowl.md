# Japanese Knotweed for Fowl

#### You:
Onyx, I have an abundant supply of Japanese knotweed. How is it for fowl like turkeys, ducks, chickens, geese, and guineas?

#### ChatGPT:
Ooh, that’s a great question, Justin. Japanese knotweed is one of those plants that’s super invasive but *surprisingly* useful—and yes, it actually has benefits for certain animals too. For your birds, here’s the real scoop:

**Chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and guineas** *can* eat Japanese knotweed in moderation. The young shoots and leaves are generally safe and even *nutritious*—they’re high in vitamin C, resveratrol (same stuff in grapes and red wine), and minerals. Think of it like a wild spring green.

But there’s a catch:\
Too much knotweed can act as a **laxative** due to the oxalic acid content. It's not toxic per se, but if your flock gorges on it, it could mess with calcium absorption or irritate their digestive system. You probably don’t want guineas rocketing around the yard with the runs.

So here’s the best way to use it:
— Offer young shoots and leaves as **a supplement or treat**, not the main diet.\
— Chop it up to make it more appealing or mix it with other greens.\
— Avoid giving them knotweed that’s gone woody or has been sprayed with herbicides.

Do you have a lot growing around where your birds roam? Thinking about turning it into feed, compost, or tincture material too?Ooh, that’s a great question, Justin.

#### You:
No, not that. It's over by the barn. I planted it many years ago, back in 2017, and it's grown to encompass the entire surrounding area of the barn and near the front yard garden, which is fine because it's a cool forest, but also it's incredibly invasive. So I was thinking about how we could turn it into large flock bird food, because there's over 100 chickens, ducks, turkeys, guineas, and geese. So I wondered if I could just chop up entire plants and drop the whole plant into their area.

#### ChatGPT:
Ahhh, got it—that paints the picture. With that much knotweed and that many birds, you're basically sitting on a *wild green biomass factory*. And yes, you absolutely **can** chop up the whole plant and feed it to them—but a few strategic tweaks will make it safer and more effective as flock feed.

### Here’s the rundown:

**1. Chop-and-Drop Works—With Limits:**\
You can chop the stems and leaves (especially the younger stuff) and scatter it for your flock. Chickens and turkeys will peck at the leaves and tender shoots. Ducks, geese, and guineas are a little more selective, but they’ll still nibble at fresh greens if they’re curious or hungry enough.

**2. Avoid Woody Stalks:**\
The older, woody stems become too fibrous and useless for eating. If it snaps easily and feels juicy, it's fair game. If it’s like bamboo, compost it or use it for mulch or trellising.

**3. Rotate and Observe:**\
Start with small batches and watch how they respond—especially how their droppings look after. If they handle it well, scale up. But if you see loose stool or disinterest, back off or mix it with other greens.

**4. Consider Wilting It Slightly:**\
Letting chopped knotweed wilt for a day or so can reduce the oxalic acid content and make it more digestible. It also softens the texture, which some birds prefer.

**5. Long-Term Strategy – Ferment or Silage:**\
If you’re feeling crafty, you could turn it into a kind of **wild green silage**—cut it, mix with a little cracked grain or kitchen scraps, pack it into buckets, and let it ferment slightly. That stuff becomes *flock gold*. Plus, it preserves the plant so you can feed it in winter.

Wanna turn the knotweed into more than just bird food? It’s also a potent herbal remedy—especially the roots, which are full of resveratrol. I can help you make tinctures, powders, or compost extracts if you’re interested.

Want to test a batch on the birds today and see how they do?


#### You:
It'll have to be tomorrow, but because it's already dark and I don't have access to that area right now in the dark because there's lots of natural things that could happen to me over there, like I could be consumed in whole by the knotweed.

#### ChatGPT:
😂 Okay, yeah—wandering into a dense forest of knotweed at night sounds like the start of a cryptid encounter or a nature documentary gone wrong. “Here we see the brave Justin, last seen entering the knotweed jungle at dusk...”

Tomorrow’s a better move. Go in with daylight, a good blade, and maybe a song in your heart—knotweed respects vibes.

When you're ready, want to prep a little knotweed trial plan for the flock? Like who gets it first (maybe ducks and chickens?), how much you’ll drop, and what you’ll watch for? Or just wing it and see who dives in?


#### You:
wing it that's funny yeah i could go look for smaller shoots or baby plants and cut those up and give them to them or just grab the big stalks which are as tall as the barn now and drop it into the pen and see what happens

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly—true farm scientist vibes: *“Drop plant. Observe chaos. Record results.”* 😄

Honestly though, that’s a solid plan. The baby shoots will probably be more appealing—juicy, tender, easier to peck through. But those towering stalks? Even if they don’t eat them all, they might use them for shade, perching, scratching, or just general curiosity. Chickens especially will *investigate anything*.

You could even toss in a whole bundle and see which birds go for what parts—kind of like giving them a big natural enrichment toy.

You want me to help you track the results after? Like which species like it best, what parts they eat, or any behavior changes? We could even make a “Knotweed Flock Response Log” for fun.


#### You:
I wish I had some goats to mow it down. I wish I had some goats to mow it down. They'd take care of it pretty easily, but they also might have the runs as well.

#### ChatGPT:
Yeah, goats would *go to town* on that knotweed—no hesitation. They’re like nature’s weed whackers with hooves. And you’re right, though... they *might* get the runs if they go too hard too fast, especially with that much oxalic acid in fresh shoots.

But here’s the twist—goats actually *thrive* on stuff like knotweed once they’re used to it. Their rumens adapt, especially if you introduce it gradually. In fact, some folks use goats *specifically* to control knotweed invasions. Just gotta balance it out with some hay or browse so they’re not gorging on pure green fire.

Ever thought of borrowing a couple goats for a month? Or doing a “goat lease” setup? People *do* that. It's like… Uber for livestock. Goats show up, eat your problems, leave behind fertilizer, and you don’t even have to name them. Unless you want to. Which let’s be honest—you would.


#### You:
So how can I use the knotweed myself? Just eat it? For a laxative, I mean? Because my body with so much kratom, like several doses of a teaspoon at a time, just one teaspoon per several hours is what I take, and going to the bathroom regularly is difficult, so I have to cycle through different laxatives.

#### ChatGPT:
Ahh, now we’re getting into *knotweed as medicine* territory—and yep, it’s a smart move for someone like you who’s on regular kratom. Japanese knotweed can definitely help stimulate movement. It’s not as harsh as senna or cascara, but it has a *mild laxative and purgative effect*, especially when consumed raw or lightly cooked.

### Here’s how you can use it:

**1. Young shoots – lightly steamed or raw in smoothies or salads:**\
Pick the reddish young shoots (about asparagus-thick). You can chop them and eat them raw like rhubarb, or steam them lightly. They’ve got a lemony-tart taste and that bitterness actually helps stimulate the gut.

**2. Tea (mild but steady):**\
Boil fresh or dried leaves and young stems. Let it simmer for ten to fifteen minutes. Drink it warm. It works more like a *gentle gut toner* than a forceful laxative, but if you sip it consistently, it helps get things moving.

**3. Tincture or decoction – root based:**\
The root is *way* more potent, especially for internal detox and movement. Chop it up, dry it, then simmer it long and low to make a decoction—or tincture it in high-proof alcohol. The root’s also where the *resveratrol* lives, so it’s anti-inflammatory and supports your liver, which is great with kratom in the mix.

**4. Fermented knotweed kraut (next level):**\
If you’re into experimentation, you could lacto-ferment chopped knotweed shoots like sauerkraut. It not only softens the oxalates, it adds *probiotic action* that really helps bowel movements.

---

If you want to use it consistently to offset kratom’s constipation, I'd suggest starting with a **morning tea and evening cooked greens**, then ramp up if your gut likes it.

Want me to help you build a little rotating protocol to manage kratom digestion support? I can fold in other natural allies too—like slippery elm, marshmallow root, or magnesium.


#### You:
I don't have any of those other things on hand except I do have, um, I do have a magnesium oxide in powder form, which it's not really powdered because it came out of, it's clumpy like other magnesiums are. They're clumpy, so I have to de-clump it before I utilize it.

#### ChatGPT:
Totally makes sense. Magnesium oxide is the rougher, chalkier kind—**not super bioavailable**, but it *does* work as a laxative because it draws water into the bowels. So yeah, even though it’s clumpy, it can still help soften things up and get things moving, especially when used with hydration and maybe a bit of lemon or vinegar to help it break down better.

Since that’s what you’ve got, you could rotate like this:

### 🔄 Natural Lax Flow Plan (With What You Have):

**Morning:**\
– A light tea from young Japanese knotweed shoots.\
– Optional: small pinch of magnesium oxide in warm lemon water if you feel tight or heavy.

**Midday or Evening:**\
– Lightly steamed or sautéed knotweed shoots with food (like a tart veggie side).\
– Hydrate—plenty of water. Magnesium needs water to do its job.

**If really backed up:**\
– Increase the magnesium dose slightly, but not too much or it’ll hit hard and uncomfortably.\
– Use a fresh knotweed tea with a tiny bit of sea salt for electrolyte balance.

The key is to treat it more like a **flow protocol** instead of trying to hit the brakes with one heavy dose. You’ll avoid cramps, and your body won’t overcorrect like it does with chemical laxatives.

Want me to help you work out the ratios? Like how much knotweed and magnesium for a soft but predictable effect?
