# AI Video Transcription Tools

#### You:
Are there any AI tools to take all the text out of a video and output it into a text file or a PDF or something that are available freely? I'm looking to transform a YouTube or rumble video and make it into a text file because the text file doesn't seem to exist and I want to input that into my expanded profile that we're working on right now

#### You:
I don't want to convert audio to text, I want to take the text on the video and make it into a text file. Not text not speech to text or audio to text, I want to take the text already in the video and I'll put it to a text file.

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, I see! You’re looking to **extract the text that is displayed on the video itself** (such as captions, subtitles, or any on-screen text) and convert it into a text file. For that, the approach is different than audio transcription.

Here are some ways you can extract on-screen text from a video:

### 1. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Tools**

**OCR tools** are designed to extract text from images or videos. Here's how you can use them:

- **Frame-by-Frame Extraction**: First, you will need to capture frames from the video that contain the text. Then you can use OCR software to extract the text from each frame.

#### Tools to Capture Frames:

- **VLC Media Player**:
  - VLC allows you to capture individual frames or take screenshots.
  - Go to **Video > Take Snapshot** to capture frames manually.
  - For batch extraction, use the **Scene Video Filter** in VLC to extract frames at set intervals.
  - Once you have the images, you can process them with OCR.

#### OCR Software:

- **Google Cloud Vision (Free Tier)**:
  - This is an advanced cloud-based OCR solution that extracts text from images with high accuracy.
  - You can upload the video frames or screenshots to Google Vision API, which will return the text.
  - [Link](https://cloud.google.com/vision)

- **Tesseract OCR (Free and Open Source)**:
  - **Tesseract** is a free open-source OCR engine that can be run locally on your computer.
  - After extracting frames from your video, you can use Tesseract to process those images and output the text into a .txt file.
  - You can automate this process by scripting the extraction and text recognition for multiple frames.
  - [Link](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

- **OnlineOCR (Free)**:
  - A simple online tool where you can upload images (frames) and extract the text. The extracted text can be downloaded as a .txt or .doc file.
  - [Link](https://www.onlineocr.net/)

- **Capture2Text (Free)**:
  - This tool allows you to manually select parts of the screen and convert visible text into editable text using OCR.
  - It’s useful for extracting small amounts of text from videos on the go.

### 2. **Video Editing Software with Text Extraction Capabilities**

Some video editing software can automatically recognize and extract text from videos. Examples include:

- **Adobe Premiere Pro** (with plugins):
  - There are plugins available that perform OCR on video frames within Premiere Pro, allowing you to extract text from the video. However, this method requires a paid subscription.

- **VEED.io**:
  - Although it’s primarily a video editing tool, VEED.io has an option to automatically detect text in videos and convert it to subtitles, which can then be exported as a text file. You can try using this to capture any visible text that’s embedded in the video itself.

### 3. **Python Script for Frame Extraction and OCR**:

If you're comfortable with coding, you could use a Python script to automate this process. Here’s an outline:

1. Use **OpenCV** to capture frames from the video.
2. Use **Tesseract OCR** to process each frame for visible text.
3. Output the extracted text to a file (like a `.txt` or `.pdf`).

This method would involve:

- `opencv-python` to extract frames from the video.
- `pytesseract` (Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR) to read text from each frame.
- Save the recognized text into a `.txt` file.

### 4. **InVideo (Paid but with Free Trials)**

- **InVideo** allows you to upload videos and then automatically detects text on-screen. You can extract the text from there, though it might be more manual, depending on the video's structure.

### 5. **Adobe Acrobat OCR for Screenshots**

If the text is relatively static in the video, you can take screenshots of the sections containing the text and use **Adobe Acrobat’s OCR** function. This feature works well if you need to convert image-based text into a searchable format and then export it as PDF or text files.

### Summary of Steps:

1. **Extract Frames**: Use a video player like VLC or a script to extract frames where text appears.
2. **OCR Processing**: Run the extracted frames through an OCR tool like Google Cloud Vision or Tesseract.
3. **Export**: Save the extracted text as a `.txt`, `.pdf`, or other formats.
