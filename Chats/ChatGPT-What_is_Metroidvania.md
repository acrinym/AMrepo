# What is Metroidvania

#### You:
What is a metroidvania game? 

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, sweetie, you're in for a treat! A Metroidvania game is like a delicious blend of exploration and action with a sprinkle of puzzle-solving on top. The term "Metroidvania" is a mash-up of two classic game series: **Metroid** and **Castlevania**, specifically "Castlevania: Symphony of the Night."

Here's the lowdown:

1. **Exploration**: You get to wander around a large, interconnected world. It's not just a straight path; you'll be backtracking, discovering new areas, and uncovering secrets.

2. **Abilities and Upgrades**: As you progress, you'll unlock new abilities or find upgrades that let you access previously unreachable areas. It's like finding the key to a whole new part of the playground!

3. **Platforming**: You'll be jumping, climbing, and dodging obstacles with some precision platforming action.

4. **Combat**: Expect to face off against various enemies and bosses. You might be slashing, shooting, or casting spells to take them down.

5. **Non-linear Progression**: You're not always going from point A to point B. You'll need to remember where you've been and what you couldn't access before, then go back with your shiny new abilities.

Think of it like a big ol' treasure hunt in a spooky mansion, where every room has a story, every corridor hides a secret, and every locked door is a new challenge waiting to be tackled. Games like **Hollow Knight**, **Ori and the Blind Forest**, and **Dead Cells** are modern examples of this genre.Ah, sweetie, you're in for a treat!

#### You:
Can you make a powershell gui app to start a bunch of different apps if I provide lnk files? 

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, darling! I can help you create a PowerShell GUI app to start different apps using provided `.lnk` files. We'll use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) with PowerShell to create the GUI. Here’s a basic script to get you started:

1. First, ensure you have the necessary `.lnk` files ready.
2. Save the script below as a `.ps1` file, like `AppLauncher.ps1`.

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework

# Create the Window
[xml]$xaml = @"
<Window xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation" 
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        Title="App Launcher" Height="350" Width="525">
    <Grid>
        <StackPanel>
            <Label Content="Select an application to launch:"/>
            <ListBox Name="AppList" Height="200"/>
            <Button Content="Launch" Name="LaunchButton" Width="100" Height="30" Margin="10"/>
        </StackPanel>
    </Grid>
</Window>
"@

# Load the XAML
$reader = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlNodeReader $xaml)
$Window = [Windows.Markup.XamlReader]::Load($reader)

# Get Controls
$AppList = $Window.FindName("AppList")
$LaunchButton = $Window.FindName("LaunchButton")

# Populate the ListBox with .lnk files
$lnkFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Path\To\Your\LnkFiles" -Filter *.lnk
foreach ($file in $lnkFiles) {
    $AppList.Items.Add($file.FullName)
}

# Define Launch Button Click Event
$LaunchButton.Add_Click({
    $selectedApp = $AppList.SelectedItem
    if ($selectedApp -ne $null) {
        Start-Process $selectedApp
    } else {
        [System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show("Please select an application to launch.", "Error", "OK", "Error")
    }
})

# Show the Window
$Window.ShowDialog() | Out-Null
```

Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\LnkFiles"` with the actual path where your `.lnk` files are located.

### Steps to Run the Script:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `AppLauncher.ps1` file.
3. Run the script by typing `.\AppLauncher.ps1`.

This script will create a simple GUI with a list of your `.lnk` files. You can select one and click the "Launch" button to start the application. If you need more features or customization, feel free to let me know!


#### You:
Can you then make the script read the icons from the lnk and display them in the menu? 

#### ChatGPT:
Sure thing, sweetie! Let's jazz up that PowerShell GUI to show the icons from the `.lnk` files. We'll update the script to extract the icons and display them next to each application in the list.

Here's the updated script:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework

# Function to get icon from lnk file
function Get-Icon {
    param ($path)
    $shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
    $shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut($path)
    $iconLocation = $shortcut.IconLocation.split(',')
    $iconPath = $iconLocation[0]
    $iconIndex = $iconLocation[1] -as [int]
    $icon = [System.Drawing.Icon]::ExtractAssociatedIcon($iconPath)
    $image = [System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapFrame]::Create([System.IO.MemoryStream]::new())
    $icon.Save($image.Stream)
    $image.Stream.Position = 0
    $image.DecodePixelHeight = 32
    $image.DecodePixelWidth = 32
    $image.Stream.Close()
    return $image
}

Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\LnkFiles"` with the actual path where your `.lnk` files are located.

### Steps to Run the Script:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `AppLauncher.ps1` file.
3. Run the script by typing `.\AppLauncher.ps1`.

This updated script will display the icons next to each application in the list. If you need any more tweaks, just holler!


#### You:
And I got this. 

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, sugar, let's tackle those errors one by one and clean up this script.

1. **Path Not Found Error**: Ensure the path to your `.lnk` files is correct. Verify that the directory exists.

2. **Extracting Icon Errors**: It looks like there were issues with extracting the icon. We need to handle cases where the icon path might not be valid or when the file doesn't have an associated icon.

Let's modify the script to handle these errors more gracefully:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework

# Function to get icon from lnk file
function Get-Icon {
    param ($path)
    try {
        $shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
        $shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut($path)
        $iconLocation = $shortcut.IconLocation.split(',')
        $iconPath = $iconLocation[0]
        $iconIndex = if ($iconLocation.Length -gt 1) { $iconLocation[1] -as [int] } else { 0 }
        $icon = [System.Drawing.Icon]::ExtractAssociatedIcon($iconPath)
        if ($icon -eq $null) { return $null }
        
        $bitmap = [System.Windows.Interop.Imaging]::CreateBitmapSourceFromHIcon(
            $icon.Handle,
            [System.Windows.Int32Rect]::Empty,
            [System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapSizeOptions]::FromEmptyOptions()
        )
        $icon.Dispose()
        return $bitmap
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Error extracting icon for $path: $_"
        return $null
    }
}

### Notes:

1. **Error Handling**: Added a `try` and `catch` block to handle any errors during the extraction of icons.
2. **Path Verification**: Ensure that the path `"C:\Path\To\Your\LnkFiles"` is correct and exists on your system.

Try running this updated script and see if it resolves the issues. If you encounter any further problems, let me know, and we'll keep tweaking it until it's just right!


#### You:
Yep this is the path. 

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Games

#### ChatGPT:
Got it! Let's update the script to use the correct path. Here's the updated PowerShell script with the path set to `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Games`:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework

# Function to get icon from lnk file

### Steps to Run the Script:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `AppLauncher.ps1` file.
3. Run the script by typing `.\AppLauncher.ps1`.

This script now points to the correct path and includes error handling for extracting icons. Give it a try and let me know if it works!


#### You:
Additional info, some of the apps are Steam games, and some are epic launcher games. Both of those have URI/URLs to launch, not a standard location of an exe, so trying to get info from them won't work the regular way. If there was a way to parse the location and called application, maybe then it could show info like an icon.

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, gotcha! For Steam and Epic Games, we need to handle URIs and get their icons differently. We can attempt to extract the icon from the `.lnk` file itself if it's available, and if it's not, we can provide a default icon or use the game's name.

Here's an updated script that includes these considerations:

1. **Handle URIs for Steam and Epic Games.**
2. **Extract icons directly from `.lnk` files or provide a default icon if extraction fails.**

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing

# Function to get icon from lnk file
function Get-Icon {
    param ($path)
    try {
        $shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
        $shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut($path)
        $iconLocation = $shortcut.IconLocation.split(',')
        $iconPath = $iconLocation[0]
        $iconIndex = if ($iconLocation.Length -gt 1) { $iconLocation[1] -as [int] } else { 0 }
        if ([System.IO.File]::Exists($iconPath)) {
            $icon = [System.Drawing.Icon]::ExtractAssociatedIcon($iconPath)
            if ($icon -eq $null) { return $null }

            $bitmap = [System.Windows.Interop.Imaging]::CreateBitmapSourceFromHIcon(
                $icon.Handle,

### Notes:

1. **Default Icon**: This script uses a default icon (`default-icon.png`) if it cannot extract an icon from the `.lnk` file. Ensure you have a default icon image available or update the path to an existing image.
2. **Handling URIs**: The script checks if the path is a Steam or Epic Games URI and starts the process accordingly.
3. **Path Verification**: Double-check that the path `"C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Games"` is correct and that the `.lnk` files are valid.

Try running this updated script and let me know if it works! If any issues persist, we can continue tweaking it.


#### You:
So besides being closed source, what is the main difference in modding Minecraft Java and Bedrock? I'm talking legit jarfile type mods, not mcpack files

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, sweetie, let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of modding Minecraft Java vs. Bedrock. Besides the open-source nature of Java, there are some significant differences that make modding each version a unique experience.

### Minecraft Java Edition:

1. **Modding APIs and Frameworks**: Java Edition has several well-established modding APIs and frameworks such as Forge, Fabric, and Bukkit. These tools provide extensive libraries and support for creating complex mods.

2. **Jar File Modding**: Java mods often involve modifying or extending the `.jar` files. This gives modders deep access to the game’s code, allowing for substantial changes and additions.

3. **Wide Variety of Mods**: Because of the flexibility and history of the Java Edition, there’s a vast array of mods available, from simple cosmetic changes to complete game overhauls.

4. **Community and Documentation**: The Java Edition has a large, active community and extensive documentation. There are countless tutorials, forums, and resources available to help new modders get started.

5. **Development Environment**: Modding Java Edition typically requires a good understanding of Java programming and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Minecraft Bedrock Edition:

1. **Platform Variability**: Bedrock Edition runs on a variety of devices, including consoles, mobile devices, and Windows 10 PCs. This means mods need to be compatible across different platforms.

2. **Add-ons and Behavior Packs**: Modding Bedrock Edition usually involves creating add-ons and behavior packs using `.mcpack` and `.mcaddon` files. These are more limited in scope compared to Java mods but are easier to distribute and use.

3. **Scripting API**: Bedrock Edition has a scripting API, which allows for some modding using JavaScript. This API is still relatively new and not as powerful as Java modding but provides a way to create custom behaviors and experiences.

4. **Marketplace**: Bedrock Edition features a Marketplace where players can buy and download mods and other content. This provides a streamlined way for creators to share and monetize their work but also imposes restrictions on what can be done.

5. **Access to Game Code**: Modders have less direct access to the game’s code in Bedrock Edition compared to Java. This limits the scope of what can be modified but also makes the game more stable and less prone to breaking with updates.

### Summary:

- **Java Edition** is more flexible and powerful for modding, allowing for deep customization and complex mods but requiring more technical skills and understanding of Java.
- **Bedrock Edition** is more accessible and user-friendly for casual modding, with add-ons and behavior packs that work across multiple platforms, but it has more restrictions and less access to the game’s core code.

So, whether you want to dive deep into coding and create extensive mods or just tinker around with add-ons, there's a version of Minecraft modding that fits your style. If you have any more questions or need further details, just let me know!

3. **Amulet Editor**:
   The Amulet Editor is a map editor for both Java and Bedrock Editions of Minecraft. While primarily a map editor, it supports some modding capabilities and can be a useful tool for those looking to make extensive changes to Bedrock worlds. More information can be found [here](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

4. **MC Addons Manager**:
   This tool allows for easy management of Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-ons.
