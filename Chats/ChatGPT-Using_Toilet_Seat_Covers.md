How in the hell do you use one of these toilet seat covers? I've seen them for years but never needed them before now.... For vaccine shedding prevention.

To use a toilet seat cover like the one shown in your photo:

1. **Preparation**: Take the seat cover out of its packaging or dispenser, ensuring it's intact and clean.

2. **Perforation**: Notice the perforated inner section of the cover (forming a flap or oval shape). Push this inner section gently down so that it hangs slightly below the cover, allowing it to rest in the bowl once placed.

3. **Placement**: Place the entire cover on the toilet seat with the flap hanging inside the bowl. Align it so it covers the seat fully.

4. **Usage**: Sit on the toilet seat as usual. The cover acts as a barrier between you and the surface.

5. **Disposal**: Once done, flush the toilet. Most covers are made to flush easily, but check for any disposal instructions. If it’s not flushable, dispose of it in a trash bin.

For **vaccine shedding prevention** or general hygiene concerns, the cover can help reduce direct contact with the toilet seat, adding an extra layer of protection. However, if you're looking for enhanced hygiene, you may also consider sanitizing the seat before placing the cover.To use a toilet seat cover like the one shown in your photo:
