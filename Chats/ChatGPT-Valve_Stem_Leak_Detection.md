# Valve Stem Leak Detection

How do I know if my valve stem is leaking air? I went from 30 something PSI down to 20 something PSI in 3 hours or maybe 2 hours

A valve stem leak can cause a significant loss of air pressure in a short period. Here are steps to check if your valve stem is leaking air:

1. **Visual Inspection**:
   - Check the valve stem for any obvious signs of damage, such as cracks or breaks.
   - Look for moisture or bubbling around the base of the valve stem, which could indicate a slow leak.

2. **Soapy Water Test**:
   - Mix a solution of soap and water.
   - Apply the soapy water around the base of the valve stem and on the valve cap area.
   - Watch for bubbles forming. If bubbles appear, it indicates a leak.

3. **Listen for Air Escaping**:
   - Remove the valve cap and listen closely for a hissing sound, which could indicate air escaping from the valve stem.

4. **Use a Valve Core Tool**:
   - Tighten the valve core using a valve core tool. Sometimes a loose valve core can cause air to leak.
   - If tightening doesn’t work, you may need to replace the valve core.

5. **Professional Check**:
   - If you’re unable to identify the leak yourself, consider taking your vehicle to a tire shop where professionals can use more advanced tools to diagnose and fix the problem.

If you find a leak, replacing the valve stem or valve core is usually a straightforward and inexpensive fix.A valve stem leak can cause a significant loss of air pressure in a short period. Here are steps to check if your valve stem is leaking air:
