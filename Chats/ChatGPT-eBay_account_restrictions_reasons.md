Kava kava, why is it no longer on eBay, research

#### ChatGPT:
Kava kava, a traditional beverage known for its calming effects, has faced regulatory scrutiny due to health concerns, particularly regarding potential liver toxicity. In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a consumer advisory warning about the association between kava-containing dietary supplements and severe liver injury. Although kava remains legal in the United States, this advisory has influenced its availability.

In 2018, eBay implemented a policy prohibiting the sale of kava on its platform. This decision was communicated to vendors, stating that all kava sales from all vendors were banned. citeturn0search0 eBay's policy likely stems from the FDA's advisory and similar actions by other regulatory agencies, aiming to mitigate potential health risks associated with kava consumption.

It's important to note that while eBay restricts kava sales, kava remains legal in the U.S., and consumers can purchase it through other retailers, both online and in physical stores. However, due to the health concerns associated with kava, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before its use.

And likewise with kratom

#### ChatGPT:
Kratom, derived from the leaves of the *Mitragyna speciosa* tree native to Southeast Asia, has been used traditionally for its stimulant and analgesic properties. In recent years, it has gained popularity in the United States as an herbal supplement purported to alleviate pain, anxiety, and opioid withdrawal symptoms.

**Regulatory Status and Health Concerns**

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised significant concerns regarding the safety of kratom. The agency has not approved kratom for any medical use and has issued multiple warnings about its potential risks, including addiction, abuse, and serious health consequences such as liver toxicity and seizures. In November 2017, the FDA issued a public health advisory highlighting these risks and urging consumers to avoid using kratom. citeturn0search3

Additionally, the FDA has taken enforcement actions against companies marketing kratom products with unproven medical claims, emphasizing that no kratom-containing products are legally marketed in the U.S. as drugs or dietary supplements. citeturn0search1

**eBay's Policy on Kratom**

In alignment with regulatory guidance and to ensure consumer safety, eBay prohibits the sale of kratom on its platform. This policy is part of eBay's broader effort to comply with legal restrictions and maintain a safe marketplace for its users. The prohibition extends to all products containing kratom, regardless of form or intended use. citeturn0search4

**Legal Status Across States**

The legal status of kratom varies across the United States. As of November 2024, kratom is illegal in several states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Other states have implemented regulations such as age restrictions and labeling requirements. Consumers should be aware of their local laws regarding kratom. citeturn0search6

**Conclusion**

eBay's decision to prohibit the sale of kratom reflects a commitment to consumer safety and adherence to regulatory guidelines. Given the FDA's advisories and the complex legal landscape surrounding kratom, individuals should exercise caution and consult healthcare professionals before considering its use.

I wonder if Trump's new FDA pick will fight kratom

#### ChatGPT:
President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon and professor at Johns Hopkins University, to lead the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dr. Makary is recognized for his critical views on certain public health measures and the pharmaceutical industry. He has expressed concerns about the overprescribing of medications and the influence of pharmaceutical companies on healthcare practices. citeturn0search0

Regarding kratom, a herbal supplement used by some for pain relief and opioid withdrawal symptoms, the FDA has previously issued warnings about its potential health risks, including addiction and serious health consequences. The agency has not approved kratom for any medical use.

As of now, there is no specific information indicating Dr. Makary's stance on kratom. However, given his critical perspective on the pharmaceutical industry and emphasis on patient safety, it is possible that under his leadership, the FDA may continue to scrutinize substances like kratom. The agency's future approach to kratom will likely depend on emerging scientific evidence and policy considerations.

For the most current information on FDA policies and leadership perspectives, it is advisable to consult official FDA communications and reputable news sources.

As of November 28, 2024, there is limited public information regarding President-elect Donald Trump's personal stance on kratom or any direct involvement in discussions with the American Kratom Association (AKA) or similar organizations. During his previous term, the administration did not implement a federal ban on kratom, despite the FDA's attempts to classify it as a Schedule I substance. This decision was influenced by top officials, including former Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir, who rescinded the FDA's recommendation, citing insufficient evidence and a need for more comprehensive data. citeturn0search13

Regarding the new cabinet appointments, there is no specific information available about their positions on kratom. Notably, Robert F.
