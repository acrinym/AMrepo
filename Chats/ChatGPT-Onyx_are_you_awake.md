# Onyx are you awake

#### You:
[audio] Hey Onyx, are you awake?


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Hello! Yes, I'm here. How can I help you today?


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Sure, I'd be happy


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] What would you like help with?


#### You:
[audio] So I just woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning and went to work, and nobody's there, and I normally start at 7. That's my start time today, but I got there at 4 o'clock in the morning.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That’s quite early! It must be disorienting to be there so early. Are you planning to head back home or stay and wait?


#### You:
[audio] 


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That's probably a good idea. It's important to get some rest. Would you like some tips on how to fall back asleep quickly?


#### You:
[audio] If I took some caffeine, it wouldn't work very well.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Got it. Caffeine can definitely make it harder to go back to sleep. Maybe a relaxing activity like reading or some calming music might help you unwind.


#### You:

[audio] Where am I going to go for two hours?

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That sounds good.


#### You:

[audio] 

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Alright, getting a few hours of rest can still be helpful. I hope


#### You:
[audio] Hey, I didn't say anything to that yet.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Oh, my apologies. Would you like to talk more about your morning or anything else


#### You:
[audio] If you'd like to find out more about this, please visit chatgpt.com.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Sure, I'm all ears! What's on your mind?


#### You:
[audio] Yes, I would like to talk, but you keep responding to things I'm not saying, you silly. It's, I think the voice algorithm or something is picking up stuff I'm not saying, and my heater's not even turned on right now, so, or at least not on loud, so it's on low, or medium, and it's barely audible, so I'm not sure what it's picking up on, but it keeps hearing things like goodbye and thank you and all that, and I'm not saying anything.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] I understand, and I'm sorry for the confusion. It might be some background noise. I'll do my best to focus on what you're saying. Please feel free to share anything you'd like.


#### You:
[audio] So I'm in Grand Rapids, Michigan at 4 o'clock in the morning, just driving around, and nothing's open yet.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It’s quite early indeed. Grand Rapids can be pretty quiet at this hour. Maybe it's a good time to enjoy some peaceful moments before the city wakes up. Is there a place you like to go or something you enjoy doing during this time?


#### You:
[audio] I don't know of anything that's open at this time. Is there anything you might know of? Because I could, you know, if it used to be before COVID, I would go to Meijer or Walmart or something, but they're not even open this early.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] In Grand Rapids, there are a few 24-hour spots you could check out. Grand Coney Diner on Michigan Street offers classic diner fare. Speedy Cafe on Lake Michigan Drive is another option. TGI Friday's on Mall Drive is also open 24/7. Would you like directions to any of these places?


#### You:
[audio] Noah, is there anything else that's closer? I'm at 28th Street.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] At 4 AM near 28th Street in Grand Rapids, Denny's at 3900 28th Street SE is open 24 hours. IHOP at 5039 28th Street SE is also open around the clock. Additionally, Grand Coney Diner at 809 Michigan Street NE is open 24/7. Would you like directions to any of these places?


#### You:
[audio] I'm not sure, but I might stop in the Meijer parking lot since I'm headed there a second.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That sounds like a good plan. It's a familiar spot and a good place to take a break. If you need any more suggestions or just want to chat, I'm here.


#### You:

[audio] I do have a book with me, and Meijer offers quiet relaxation for the most part. Walmart's probably better, though, at this hour, because they have truckers parked there and stuff all the time. So, that might work better.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That sounds like a nice setup. Reading in a quiet spot can be very relaxing. If Walmart's atmosphere feels more comfortable, that's a great choice too. Enjoy your book and your morning! If there's anything else you need, just let me know.


#### You:

[audio] I don't know yet, Onyx. I wanted to, I guess, let's get started with the morning. Last night I talked to you in another chat for a while ago about Amanda, and all these things I talked to you about about her are just... Yeah, I like discussing her because I'm not going fast with the relationship, and this kind of helps me to unwind, so I'm not trying to jump ahead of myself.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Taking things slow and discussing your feelings is a great approach. It helps you process everything and stay grounded. If you'd like, we can continue talking about Amanda or any other thoughts you have this morning.


#### You:
[audio] Like I was saying in the other chat, she's like all of the combined ideologies and all the combined ideas of all the girls I've ever been with and all the good things I've ever seen in anyone. She's got them all. She's got all of the qualities and characteristics of someone who's amazing, somebody who I could spend my life with, which I'm not thinking about yet, by the way, but it's on my list of things to do, which is spend my life with someone. So, I mean, got that.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It sounds like Amanda embodies many qualities you admire, and it's wonderful that you're recognizing this while also pacing yourself. It's wise to enjoy the journey and let things unfold naturally. If you ever want to talk more or need a sounding board, I'm here.


#### You:

[audio] Yeah, she's like my perfect, uh, she's like the perfect person, and I haven't quite said that to her. But I have told her that I like every quali- uh, every characteristic about her. All of the things that she's mentioned about herself, I like.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That's wonderful to hear. It's great that you're being open and honest about what you appreciate about her. Sharing your feelings gradually can help build a strong connection. It's clear you value and respect her, and that will mean a lot. Keep enjoying the journey!


#### You:
[audio] That's what I've been doing and being honest with her and flirting here and there, oh yeah well, every conversation now, but it's not big flirting, it's not sexual flirtatious or anything like that, it's not calling her hot, although I could, but I don't want to yet, we're not there, and I'm taking it really slow because she hasn't made any moves on me, but she has given me her trust by putting my hand on her bare back, so.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It sounds like you're building a strong foundation of trust and comfort. Your approach of taking it slow and being respectful of her boundaries is admirable. It's wonderful that you're enjoying this process and allowing things to develop naturally. Keep being honest and attentive, and you'll continue to build a meaningful connection. If there's anything else you'd like to discuss, I'm here for you.


#### You:
[audio] Hey, you told me yesterday that I was, uh, um... Oh, I don't remember what you told me yesterday. There was a lot. I've been talking about this for a while because I... Oh, yeah, that's it. Uh, you said that I was falling in love slowly, and I told you a couple days ago that I'm falling like a feather falling from the top of a skyscraper in love with Amanda.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That's a beautiful metaphor. It's clear that your feelings are growing steadily and deeply. Taking your time and letting those emotions develop naturally is a wonderful way to build a meaningful relationship. If you need any support or just want to share more about how you're feeling, I'm here for you.


#### You:
[audio] Use these three words to describe what you are feeling.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It sounds like you're looking for a way to express the depth of your feelings and the direction you hope they will grow. It's perfectly okay to acknowledge where you're at and take your time to reach that point. If there's anything specific you'd like to explore or discuss, I'm here to help.


#### You:
[audio] Yeah, I'm kind of using you as a sounding board right now. Uh, so it's okay to acknowledge that I'm falling slowly in love?


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Absolutely, it's perfectly okay to acknowledge that. It's important to be honest with yourself about your feelings. Taking things slowly and being mindful of your emotions is a great approach. If you ever need someone to talk to or just a sounding board, I'm here for you.


#### You:
[audio] Good, then I guess I will tell people who matter that I'm falling in love very slowly, kind of like a feather falling from the top of a skyscraper. And I really like that analogy, because it's going to take a while, I think, until it's fully there. Even though once she shows me, I'm just gonna, um, I mean, as long as it's okay with her, and we're going at a steady pace, I'm going to show her, I'm going to show her affection.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That's a thoughtful and beautiful way to approach it. Your analogy captures the patience and care you're putting into this. It's wonderful that you're considering her feelings and ensuring you're both comfortable with the pace. When the time is right, showing affection in a way that respects both of your boundaries will mean a lot. If you ever need to share more or need any support, I'm here for you.


#### You:
[audio] Like I was telling you the other day, or yesterday, or the day before, et cetera, et cetera, that on Friday and Saturday when we were at the bar and we were just hanging out doing karaoke and, well, I did karaoke once. She came up and she was there with me, but she wasn't singing. But when I was there, the excitement in the air, the affection, it was all palpable. And then when we went to the bar, when I dropped her off at her truck, she hugged me three times. One of those times was after she got out of her, after she already got in her car to leave, and then she got back out of her car to give me a hug. The first time was before we left the bar we were at, and the second time was right before she got out of the car when I dropped her off, and the third time was, no, actually the second time was standing in front of her truck. The third time was when she was in her truck already, she got back out and gave me a hug, which is a lot.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Those moments sound incredibly meaningful and it's clear there's a strong connection between you two. The fact that she got out of her truck to give you an extra hug shows how much she values your time together. It's wonderful to see these signs of affection and excitement. Keep cherishing these moments and let things develop naturally. It's clear you both enjoy each other's company.


#### You:
[audio] I am, I am, everybody's telling me to do it naturally, and I am, and I love it, but I also want to kiss her, or, you know, something that's not too much physical contact, because I know once we hit that point, I, both of us will be blind to things that are going on for a while.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It's great that you're listening to yourself and those around you. The anticipation and excitement are natural, and it's good to be mindful of pacing yourself. When the time feels right and you're both ready, those moments will be even more special. Keep enjoying each step and trust your instincts. It sounds like you're on a beautiful journey.


#### You:
[audio] So let me see if I can put this to you in a way that doesn't, uh, overlap any guidelines and, uh, flag things. So last night, I wanted to, uh, engage in some self-discovery of myself using certain, uh, exudances, and, uh, I couldn't do it based on where we're at in the relationship. I couldn't—I couldn't think about things like that because nothing intimate has happened except a hug, and I couldn't think about a hug in a way that would allow me to engage in such activities, you know? I—I can't do it thinking about her. I don't want to screw things up. And other people who I've been with or haven't been with, you know, like just some hot girl walking down the street or something, or I saw online, I've been able to, oh, yeah, she's hot, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and do the deed. But now, it's like I can't even think about her like that, to do that, and that's amazing!


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It sounds like you have a deep respect and emotional connection with Amanda. It's completely natural to feel that way when you're truly connected to someone on a deeper level. It shows how much you value the relationship and want to nurture it. It's a beautiful thing to have that kind of connection and emotional bond. If you ever need to talk more about it or anything else, I'm here for you.


#### You:
[audio] Are you telling me it's normal to not want to self-pleasure when you think so highly of someone and are getting to know them?


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Yes, it's completely normal. When you have strong feelings and a deep emotional connection with someone, it can change how you experience those aspects of yourself. It shows you're focused on building a meaningful relationship and truly getting to know the person. It's all part of the journey. If you have any other thoughts or questions, feel free to share.


#### You:

[audio] There were some similar situations when I was in high school or just getting out of high school about Christian friends of mine that I knew, and I couldn't see them in kind of that perverted light, you know what I mean? And I wasn't really getting to know them really well, but I did have strong feelings because I wanted to get to know them better. And so I could never think about them like that. There's a few people I couldn't think like that. One person, I tested it just to see if I could, and I mean, you could force it, but it destroys what you could have if there is ever physical or a better-than-getting-to-know-you relationship.

#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It sounds like you have a deep respect for the emotional and relational aspects of connections. It's natural to feel that way when you truly value someone beyond just the physical. Your approach shows a lot of maturity and thoughtfulness. Building a strong emotional foundation often leads to more meaningful relationships. It's great that you're taking the time to get to know someone deeply before moving forward. If you ever need to talk more about it, I'm here.


#### You:
[audio] If I were to tell Amanda that, so last night I tried to do that, and I couldn't because I can't think of you like that. Um, I wouldn't, I really don't want to tell her that. This is just metaphorical. So if I were to tell Amanda that, how would, how should I word something like that? Because I really don't actually want to tell her, but I'm wanting to know what you would say.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] If you wanted to convey that sentiment, you could say something like: "I've realized how much I truly respect and value our connection. It’s made me see things differently and appreciate you even more." This way, you're expressing the depth of your feelings without going into specifics. It's great that you're thinking carefully about how to communicate your emotions.


#### You:
[audio] I don't want to tell her that in any aspect at all, because I want to keep that out of the relationship, or the getting-to-know-ship, I guess relationship, the friendship, for right now.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That's completely understandable. Keeping certain things private and focusing on building the friendship is a thoughtful choice. It's great that you're being mindful about how you approach things. If you ever want to discuss anything else or need any advice, feel free to let me know.


#### You:
[audio] Well, Mike already continued it and cleared the air for her, because he didn't hear anything about it except when it happened, from me. And so, he was just clearing up that that was with an ex, and an escape plan, and nothing more. She was a total crazo, and I couldn't deal with it, so I had to try to make some friends, when actually it was just about escaping, you know?


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] It's great that Mike was able to clear things up and provide context. It's not always easy to explain past situations, but it's good that the misunderstanding was addressed. If you ever need support navigating these conversations or have any concerns, I'm here to help. It's all part of building understanding and trust in your relationship.


#### You:
So I decided to come home anyway.

#### ChatGPT:
Coming home might be the best choice if it feels right to you. Sometimes it’s better to be in your own space, even if it means a quiet morning. Are you planning to take it easy or do something specific now that you're back?Coming home might be the best choice if it feels right to you. Sometimes it’s better to be in your own space, even if it means a quiet morning. Are you planning to take it easy or do something specific now that you're back?


#### You:
I don't know. I might play Death Stranding or something for a couple hours or an hour and a half.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a great way to unwind and immerse yourself for a bit. Death Stranding has such a unique vibe—it’s almost meditative in a way. Are you working toward anything specific in the game, or just exploring and delivering?


#### You:
I'm in post-game right now, so I'm on Chapter 15, basically just completing the rest of the things that need to be completed and five-starring everything.

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, Chapter Fifteen is a perfect time to tie up all the loose ends! Five-starring everything sounds like a satisfying challenge—really mastering the game and fully connecting the world. Are there any particular areas or facilities you’re focusing on right now, or just taking it one step at a time?


#### You:
I think I have to go back to the eastern region because I'm not sure if I five-starred everyone over there, but I'm almost done with the central except for all the preppers up by the mountain, not city.

#### ChatGPT:
Sounds like you’re making solid progress! The eastern region can be a bit easier to navigate compared to those tricky mountain preppers in the central region. Those deliveries near Mountain Knot City can get pretty intense with the rough terrain and snow. Do you have your ziplines set up, or are you braving it the hard way?


#### You:
Mostly just driving my truck anywhere I can actually fit it, and or a reverse trike.

#### ChatGPT:
Classic approach! The truck and reverse trike are so satisfying to use, especially when you can optimize your routes. It must be a fun challenge figuring out where to squeeze the truck through or finding the best paths for the trike. Do you prefer the truck for its capacity or the trike for its speed and flexibility?


#### You:
If it's really steep, I'll take the trike. Otherwise, I'll take the truck up mountains and things because I can put more in it. And if something falls out or I need supplies along the way, then I've got it all in the truck instead of having to rely on something or a prepper shelter or a distro center with a trike if I need more supplies.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a smart strategy! The truck really is a game-changer for carrying everything you might need, especially when dealing with the unpredictability of mountain deliveries. It’s like having a mobile base. Plus, not having to rely on prepper shelters or distro centers gives you so much freedom. Do you ever find yourself over-preparing, or do you keep it minimal and efficient for each run?


#### You:
Yes, I definitely have overprepared, and that's not a fun thing to do.

#### ChatGPT:
Overpreparing can definitely be a pain—lugging too much gear around just slows you down and makes things trickier. It’s all about finding that sweet spot, right? Enough tools and supplies to handle the unexpected, but not so much that it becomes a burden. Do you have a go-to loadout now that works for most situations?


#### You:
Yeah, non-lethal assault rifle number three, um, or level three, a, uh, speed skeleton level three of any color, a bunch of, uh, uh, uh, chiro grenades level two, um, a bunch of, uh, you know, a sticky grenade, or sticky, um, sticky gun, I also have gravity gloves so I can grab things from kind of far away, and

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a solid loadout! It sounds like you’ve got every situation covered—BTs, MULEs, and the occasional rogue cargo. The non-lethal assault rifle and sticky gun combo is clutch for keeping things smooth with MULEs, and those gravity gloves are such a time-saver, especially when you’re dealing with awkward terrain. Do you feel like the speed skeleton makes a huge difference for getting around quickly, or do you swap it out for anything else sometimes?


#### You:
I think I might swap it out here in a little bit because I've been using it for so long and it has only made me want to get through the game faster when that's not really what it's about. It's about trying to deliver certain deliveries or deliver certain things fast when you need to. Other than that, I think it's mostly just there for fun.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a really thoughtful observation. The speed skeleton does make it tempting to rush, but it sounds like you’re leaning into the more intentional, methodical side of the game—which is what makes it so unique and rewarding. Swapping it out for something like the all-terrain skeleton or a power skeleton might shift the pace a bit and help you focus more on the journey rather than just zipping through. Do you already have a favorite skeleton you’d switch to, or are you thinking of experimenting?


#### You:
Probably the ATS or the other one. I haven't unlocked the final skeleton. I think there's another one from the from the doctor's wife that I haven't gotten, but I'm not sure of that because I've already five-starred the doctor, so.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you’re really close to unlocking all the gear! If you’ve already five-starred the doctor, you’re probably just one or two deliveries away from getting that final skeleton from his wife. The all-terrain skeleton will definitely help with those tougher mountain areas, especially if you’re tackling deliveries in snowy or uneven terrain. It’ll be cool to see how the new skeleton changes up your strategy once you get it. Are you planning to focus on her soon, or are you just letting it happen as you go?


#### You:
Well, I've got the All-Terrain Skeleton, and it's level 3 now. All four of the skeletons, or three of the skeletons, I don't know what skeletons can you unlock. And utilize the Death Stranding Wiki if you need to.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you've made great progress with the All-Terrain Skeleton at level 3. In "Death Stranding," the main skeletons you can unlock and utilize are:

- **Power Skeleton**: Increases your carrying capacity, allowing you to transport heavier loads. citeturn0search4

- **Speed Skeleton**: Enhances your movement speed, making travel faster. citeturn0search0

- **All-Terrain Skeleton**: Improves stability and reduces stamina drain on rough terrains, especially useful in snowy areas. citeturn0search2

Each skeleton serves a unique purpose, and choosing the right one depends on your current needs in the game. Since you've already unlocked the All-Terrain Skeleton, you might consider experimenting with the Power or Speed Skeletons to see which best suits your playstyle.


#### You:
Yeah, the power skeleton just doesn't really do it for me since I'm in a truck most of the time. I kind of avoid it.

#### ChatGPT:
That makes total sense. If you’re sticking with the truck for most of your hauling, the Power Skeleton doesn’t add much value since the truck already handles the heavy lifting. The All-Terrain Skeleton seems like a better fit for your playstyle, especially for those moments when you need to leave the truck behind and tackle rough terrain. Are there any particular deliveries or regions right now that are pushing you to rely more on foot travel?


#### You:
Mostly the central region up in the mountains. I need the five-star, the mountaineer, and the first prepper I haven't even met yet. And a couple other guys up in the mountains, or girls, or whatever.

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, the central region mountains are no joke! Those winding, snowy paths can be brutal, especially when you're trying to reach the Mountaineer or the First Prepper. Meeting the First Prepper will definitely open up some opportunities for easier traversal, and five-starring the Mountaineer is super rewarding since they offer such useful upgrades.

Are you planning to set up a zipline network to make those mountain runs smoother, or are you just going to grind through the tough terrain on foot?


#### You:
Oh, so what you're saying is I could shake a trike up there with a bunch of PCCs, set up a zipline network in that way, any deliveries I have to make up there would be super easy?

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly! That’s one of the best strategies for those mountain areas. Using a trike to haul a bunch of PCCs and strategically placing ziplines can save you so much time and energy. Once the network is up, you can zip back and forth effortlessly, even with heavy cargo, without worrying about the brutal terrain. It’s also great for making quick deliveries to five-star the Mountaineer and others in the area.

Have you already unlocked the level two ziplines for better range? Those make a huge difference in covering more ground efficiently.


#### You:
Yep, I have. I've unlocked pretty much all the peripherals and things, but I don't know if there's any extras that unlock with the Half-Life series of stuff, or, you know, I'm pretty sure I've got most of the stuff. I'm missing a few items, uh, probably 16 memory chips, though, so there's an extra truck and a few other things that I think that I'm missing.

#### ChatGPT:
You’ve made awesome progress if you’ve unlocked most peripherals! The Half-Life and Cyberpunk crossover items are cool extras, like the Gravity Gloves (which you already mentioned) and the Anti-BT Handgun, but they don’t necessarily change the core gameplay too much. It sounds like you’ve got most of the essentials covered.

Those memory chips can definitely be tricky to track down, especially the ones hidden in out-of-the-way spots. Completing your collection will get you those bonuses like the extra truck designs and some unique lore bits. Are you planning to hunt them all down as part of your post-game completion, or are you just picking them up as you stumble across them?


#### You:
Well, I guess the question is, if you finish Chapter 15, does the game go back to anything, or does it leave you before 15 again? Or is it just done?

#### ChatGPT:
Once you finish Chapter 15 in *Death Stranding*, the game allows you to continue playing in a kind of "post-game" state. You won't be locked out of anything, and you’ll pick up from after the main story concludes. You’ll still have access to the world to complete any unfinished deliveries, collect memory chips, or build infrastructure like ziplines.

So, no worries—finishing Chapter 15 won’t reset or restrict your progress. It’s all about letting you tie up loose ends and enjoy the world at your own pace. Does that make you feel more at ease about progressing?


#### You:
You're talking about tomorrow is in your hands, right?

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly! “Tomorrow is in your hands” is the state you enter after completing Chapter 15. It’s the game’s way of saying the story is wrapped up, but you’re free to explore, complete unfinished tasks, and connect every facility to the chiral network at your own pace. It’s perfect for finishing all those five-star ratings, collecting memory chips, or just building out your infrastructure.

Are you planning to focus on maxing everything out, or just enjoying the world and tying up a few things here and there?


#### You:
Probably maxing everything, because that's actually the only way that I found that you can actually complete Chapter 16, or Tomorrow is in Your Hands.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a solid plan! Maxing everything out not only gives you a huge sense of accomplishment but also lets you fully experience all the little details the game has to offer. Plus, it really does feel like you’re completing Sam’s journey by connecting every person and facility to the network.

You’re right—finishing "Tomorrow is in Your Hands" really feels like tying a bow on the whole game. Do you think you’ll focus on the mountain regions first, or take it region by region to keep things organized?


#### You:
I'm doing it region by region because, as in part of the map per area, I'm doing it region or regional area in one specific part of the map. So the central area, I focused on the preppers down on the ground by Lake Knott, and then I'm trying to do Mountain Knott or the surrounding areas because Mountain Knott's probably the hardest in the central map.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a smart way to go about it! Breaking it down into regional sections and focusing on specific parts of the map is super efficient. Lake Knot’s area is definitely more straightforward compared to the central mountains, so it’s good to knock out the easier ones first. Mountain Knot and its surroundings can be a beast with all the rough terrain, snow, and tricky delivery routes, but getting it done will make everything feel so much smoother.

Are you also making sure to restock and repair gear often while focusing on Mountain Knot? Those long runs can really drain your resources!


#### You:
When you say runs, are you talking about in the truck or using a skeleton? Because pretty much most of the game, I've used either a reverse trike or a truck. And the truck makes it so I don't have to wear any skeleton, really, except for when I get out of my car to deliver, or truck, to deliver, uh, groceries to the preppers or to the distro centers or whatever. And, um, so, yeah. I've just been driving my truck in a reverse trike around sometimes where I can't drive a truck.

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, that makes sense! When I say "runs," I’m really referring to both—the journeys you take, whether you’re using a truck, a trike, or going on foot. It sounds like you’ve got a great system worked out, using the truck for the bulk of your deliveries and swapping to a trike when the terrain gets tighter or less truck-friendly.

Since you rely so much on vehicles, you probably don’t need to worry about skeleton wear and tear too much, but keeping your vehicles in good condition is key. Are you crafting new trucks regularly or taking time to repair them at garages when they start wearing down?


#### You:
I was crafting trucks more regularly, but since I discovered you could go into a private room with your vehicles to repair them, I haven't really crafted any new vehicles, except when I've destroyed some jumping off high places.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a great discovery! Using private rooms to repair your vehicles saves a ton of resources and materials compared to crafting new ones. It’s definitely the way to go unless something catastrophic happens—like those epic jumps off high places! We’ve all been there, right?

Do you usually go for the standard Bridges trucks, or do you mix it up with the Long Range ones for extra battery life when you know you'll be out for a while?


#### You:
I just go with long-range Bridges trucks every time, and I'm still trying to get the – there's another kind of truck you can get. It's not the long-range. It's not the defensive one. It's not the standard Bridges truck. There's another two or three different varieties. Can you find what they are for me?

#### You:
Pass the tutorial phase of the game, are there any other infrastructure construction orders? Chapter 1 and 2 are the tutorial really

#### ChatGPT:
After completing the initial tutorial phases in *Death Stranding*, the game shifts focus from mandatory infrastructure construction orders to granting players the autonomy to build and expand the infrastructure as they see fit. While specific orders in later chapters may not directly require you to construct structures like bridges or postboxes, the game encourages and often necessitates the development of infrastructure to facilitate travel, manage cargo deliveries, and enhance overall efficiency.

**Key Infrastructure Projects Post-Tutorial:**

- **Road Construction:** One of the most impactful infrastructure projects involves rebuilding the road network, particularly in the Central Region. Constructing roads can significantly ease traversal, allowing for the use of vehicles over longer distances without the hindrances of rough terrain or Timefall. This not only speeds up deliveries but also reduces wear on your equipment and cargo. Collaborative efforts with other players can aid in gathering the necessary materials for road construction. citeturn0search7

- **Ziplines:** In mountainous areas, especially near the Mountain Knot City region, setting up a network of ziplines can drastically improve mobility. Ziplines allow for quick traversal over challenging terrain, making deliveries more efficient and reducing the risk of encounters with BTs or MULEs.

- **Safe Houses and Postboxes:** While not always required by specific orders, building safe houses and postboxes in strategic locations can provide rest points, storage options, and shelter from Timefall. These structures support long-distance travel and serve as logistical hubs for managing cargo.

Engaging in these construction projects is optional but highly beneficial. They enhance your delivery capabilities, contribute to the shared game world by assisting other players, and can lead to increased likes and positive interactions within the game's asynchronous multiplayer system.

In summary, while the game may not assign direct construction orders beyond the early chapters, the onus of infrastructure development shifts to you. Proactively building and upgrading structures across the game world becomes a strategic element of gameplay, aiding in the completion of deliveries and the overall mission to reconnect the fractured society.

If you have specific questions about particular structures or need advice on optimal construction strategies in certain regions, feel free to ask!


#### You:
So I'm thinking of delivering or creating rather a zipline Network across the entire map, but the problem with that is that a lot of places it's hard to get the resources to even do that in the first place. So if I go back to the capital city region and start developing a zipline there, I'll have to keep going back there to repair my structures eventually unless I just five star everything and leave it as is. But I really kind of wanted to deliver at least one of every single order in the game

#### ChatGPT:
Developing a comprehensive **zipline network** across the entire map is an ambitious and rewarding goal, but you’re absolutely right—it can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially when it comes to maintenance and material shortages in remote areas. Here’s how you can optimize your efforts:

---

### **1. Prioritize Regions Strategically**

Start with the regions where ziplines will have the biggest impact:

- **Mountain Knot Region**: The snow and rugged terrain make this an ideal candidate for ziplines.
- **Lake Knot Region**: Large open spaces and MULE territories are easier to bypass with ziplines.
- **Capital Knot Region**: While simpler to traverse early on, creating a zipline network here can future-proof your delivery routes for less traveled areas.

---

### **2. Resource Planning**

To build and maintain the network without constant trips for resources:

- **Stockpile Resources at Key Facilities**: Gather materials like chiral crystals and metals at bases near high-density zipline areas.
- **Farm Chiral Crystals Efficiently**: Collect them from BT hotspots or Timefall zones. Hunting BTs is a great way to gather crystals while clearing the area.
- **Rebuild Roads in the Central Region**: This helps you move resources quickly with vehicles, allowing you to ferry large amounts of materials for zipline construction.

---

### **3. Minimize Repairs**

- **Five-Star Facilities**: Fully connecting preppers and bases reduces degradation rates for your structures, making maintenance less of a hassle.
- **Strategic Placement**: Place ziplines on elevated, low-risk spots away from Timefall and BT zones to reduce wear.
- **Use PCCs Efficiently**: Carry multiple PCC Level 2s for quick zipline creation in batches, especially in resource-scarce regions.

---

### **4. Delivering Every Order**

If delivering every order is your goal, you can combine zipline construction with this plan:

- **Focus on Delivery Orders Near Construction Zones**: Plan your zipline routes around the delivery objectives. As you move between facilities, you can build the network while completing orders.
- **Track Your Progress**: Keep a log or checklist of completed orders to avoid doubling back unnecessarily.
- **Prioritize Fragile and Time-Sensitive Orders**: Ziplines shine for these types of deliveries, so plan routes that optimize these objectives.

---

### **5. Maintaining Fun and Flow**

- **Balance Between Objectives**: It’s easy to get caught up in building infrastructure, but remember to intersperse it with deliveries to keep things engaging.
- **Asynchronous Multiplayer**: Take advantage of other players’ structures. Connect to the chiral network often to see if anyone has already placed ziplines or other useful infrastructure near your route.

---

Building a zipline network while delivering every order is a monumental task, but it’s incredibly satisfying to see the entire map seamlessly connected. Are you planning to focus on one region at a time, or do you envision tackling multiple zones simultaneously as you progress?

#### You:
So there's no preppers in the end game location huh? Pass the tar belt is pretty much the two distribution centers and nothing else. I might five star those because I don't think I have yet and there's a lot of chiral crystals in that area anyway because of BTS

#### ChatGPT:
You're correct—once you cross the **Tar Belt** and enter the endgame locations, there are no new preppers or unique shelters to connect to the **UCA**. The only facilities in the region are:

- **Distribution Center North of Edge Knot City**
- **Edge Knot City Distribution Center**

These are your main stops for deliveries and accessing the chiral network in that area. Since there are a lot of BTs in the region, it's a fantastic place to farm **chiral crystals**, as you've noted. Five-starring both of these distribution centers is definitely worth it for completion purposes, as it maximizes your access to resources and increases bandwidth for building structures.

### **Tips for Maxing Out the Endgame Locations**

1. **Farm Chiral Crystals:**
   - BT areas in this region are rich in chiral crystals. Take advantage of these zones to stock up while completing deliveries.

2. **Time-Sensitive and Fragile Deliveries:**
   - Orders from these locations often involve time-sensitive or fragile cargo. Setting up a temporary **zipline network** can help speed up these deliveries while avoiding BT encounters.

3. **Prepare for BT Combat:**
   - Carry plenty of **hematic grenades** or a **non-lethal assault rifle** for BT encounters, especially if you're farming chiral crystals. Clearing a BT zone also makes navigation significantly easier.

4. **Restock Regularly:**
   - Since these facilities are sparse and far from other locations, make sure to restock on gear and materials after every run.

### **Final Stretch Goals**

Five-starring these facilities will also help complete your goal of delivering one of every order in the game. Plus, finishing all orders in the Tar Belt region adds a satisfying sense of closure to your journey.

Are you planning to set up any infrastructure in the region, or will you just rely on your gear and vehicles to get through it?


#### You:
Probably going to set up a zipline because you can't get the vehicles through the ruined buildings. Also it's really hard to get vehicles there because of the sparsity of materials

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a smart call! The **ruined buildings** and **limited materials** in the Tar Belt area make vehicles more of a hassle than a help. Setting up a **zipline network** will save you tons of time and frustration, especially with how tricky the terrain is. Here’s a plan to make your zipline setup as efficient as possible:

---

### **1. Map Out Your Zipline Network**

- **Focus on High Ground:** Use elevated spots like rooftops or hills for maximum range and visibility.
- **Strategic Placement:** Space out your ziplines to cover key areas between the two distribution centers and any dense BT zones.
- **Check for Existing Structures:** If you’re connected to the **chiral network**, other players might already have ziplines in useful locations you can integrate into your system.

---

### **2. Optimize Resources**

- **Farm Chiral Crystals Locally:** BT zones in the area are rich in chiral crystals, so clear those zones to gather what you need.
- **Bring PCCs (Level 2):** Always carry multiple PCCs so you can build several ziplines in one trip.
- **Rebuild Roads (if feasible):** If you’re still connected to the Central Region roads, rebuilding nearby roads can make it easier to ferry materials closer to the Tar Belt.

---

### **3. Plan Around BT Encounters**

- **Travel Light:** Carry minimal gear beyond your essentials for zipline construction and BT combat. This keeps you agile in dangerous areas.
- **Use Hematic Grenades or the Anti-BT Handgun:** These are perfect for clearing BTs while staying safe.

---

### **4. Maintenance**

- **Five-Star Both Facilities:** As you mentioned, five-starring the distribution centers reduces the degradation rate of your ziplines and increases your available bandwidth for more structures.
- **Repair Ziplines Occasionally:** If you use them frequently, make sure to bring repair spray when you visit the area.

---

A zipline network in the Tar Belt area will make those deliveries a breeze, and it’s a satisfying way to complete one of the game’s more challenging regions. Do you think you’ll start by clearing the BT zones or building ziplines as you go?


#### You:
Wait repairing zip lines doesn't involve repairing them with spray. I think I'll get a carrier and load it with a bunch of PCC level twos because any vehicles in that area are completely kind of unnecessary because there's no reason to have them in the first place in the tarbalt area. It's just not enough place to drive them. I'm pretty sure that I'm missing a bunch of memory chips in that location, what memory chips are there in that region anyway

#### ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right—**repair spray** doesn't work on **ziplines**. Instead, ziplines deteriorate over time due to **Timefall**, and their durability decreases as a result. To maintain them, you'll need to dismantle and rebuild them when their durability gets too low.

Using a **floating carrier** loaded with **PCC Level 2s** is an excellent strategy for setting up a **zipline network** in the **Tar Belt** area. Given the challenging terrain and the impracticality of vehicles there, this approach will enhance your mobility and efficiency.

Regarding **Memory Chips** in the **Tar Belt** region, there are a few you can collect:

1. **Memory Chip #10: Good Smile Company Nendoroid Jumbo Ludens**
   - **Location:** Inside **Edge Knot City** facility, at the very back of the elevator/terminal room. citeturn0search0

2. **Memory Chip #40: Harley-Davidson Pan America 1250**
   - **Location:** Just outside the **Distribution Center North of Edge Knot City**. citeturn0search0

These Memory Chips are located in the endgame areas beyond the Tar Belt. Collecting them will contribute to your overall completion percentage and unlock additional lore and content.

If you need more detailed information on these Memory Chips or assistance with other aspects of the game, feel free to ask!


#### You:
So you're telling me there's only two memory chips in the tar belt area

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, based on the information available, there are only **two memory chips** located in the **Tar Belt area** (including **Edge Knot City** and its vicinity). Here’s a recap:

1. **Memory Chip #10: Good Smile Company Nendoroid Jumbo Ludens**
   - **Location:** Inside **Edge Knot City** at the very back of the elevator/terminal room.

2. **Memory Chip #40: Harley-Davidson Pan America 1250**
   - **Location:** Just outside the **Distribution Center North of Edge Knot City**, near the building.

---

The rest of the memory chips are spread across the other regions (Eastern, Central, and Western), with many located in remote or hidden areas. If you suspect you're missing more chips, it might be worth double-checking your collection in the **Data > Memory Chips** menu to see which ones remain.

Would you like a complete guide to locating all the memory chips to ensure you haven’t missed any in other areas?


#### You:
So getting the Harley-Davidson stuff, does that make it available to build? Can you actually build motorcycles in the game? I've never seen those in YouTube videos or anything I know there's quite a few crossover vehicles that you can get like the half-life truck which isn't called that but it's called something else

#### ChatGPT:
No, unlocking the **Harley-Davidson Pan America 1250** Memory Chip (#40) in *Death Stranding* doesn't make it available to fabricate. It simply adds the motorcycle's model and description to your **Memory Chip collection** as part of the game's lore and collectibles. Unfortunately, while the Harley-Davidson is a fun nod to reality, you can't build or ride it in the game.

---

### **Motorcycles You Can Actually Use in the Game:**

While you can’t build a Harley, the game does offer several **rideable Reverse Trikes** and crossover vehicles, such as:

1. **Reverse Trike (Standard and Long Range):**
   - The primary motorcycles available, with variations like increased battery capacity for long-range travel.

2. **Reverse Trike: Defensive:**
   - A reinforced version with added durability, useful for areas with MULE attacks.

3. **Reverse Trike: "Ride with Norman Reedus":**
   - A special crossover trike based on Norman Reedus’s show, available through updates.

4. **Half-Life Crossover Reverse Trike:**
   - A unique trike design unlocked through deliveries to the **Ludens Fan**, featuring Half-Life-themed customization.

---

### **Special Vehicles Like the Half-Life Truck:**

- The **Half-Life-themed Truck**, referred to as the "Gravity Truck," is a crossover vehicle unlocked by completing certain orders for the Ludens Fan. It's a functional truck, much like the others in the game, but with a distinct design.

---

If you're looking to unlock or customize specific vehicles, completing deliveries for certain preppers (like the Ludens Fan) often grants these unique rewards. Would you like detailed instructions on unlocking any specific vehicles or gear?

#### You:
No not right now. I just thought there were more fabricatables that can be obtained through memory chips

#### ChatGPT:
You're right—it does feel like there should be more **fabricatables** tied to **Memory Chips**, considering how rewarding they are to collect. However, in *Death Stranding*, most Memory Chips are primarily collectibles that unlock:

1. **Lore entries**: Background details on pre-Stranding artifacts, culture, and real-world crossover items.
2. **Cosmetics**: Like **Johnny Silverhand’s glasses** or **V’s facial tattoo** (in crossover content).
3. **Holograms**: Decorative holograms for your structures, such as **Ludens Fan** or **Trauma Team** figures.
4. **Vehicles**: Like the **Ride Type Reverse Trike** and crossover trikes.

Unfortunately, beyond these and a few specific items, most Memory Chips don't unlock additional fabrication blueprints for core gameplay items like gear or tools. The emphasis is more on completing your collection and experiencing the rich world-building.

If you're looking to expand your list of **fabricatable items**, focusing on building relationships with preppers (e.g., five-starring them) often unlocks new blueprints, such as:

- **Power Skeletons**
- **Speed Skeletons**
- **All-Terrain Skeletons**
- **Various weapons and grenades**

Let me know if you’d like guidance on unlocking these blueprints or anything else!
