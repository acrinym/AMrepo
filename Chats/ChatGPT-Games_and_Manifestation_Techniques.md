While there aren't many mainstream video games that explicitly focus on the concepts of abundance, manifestation, or the law of attraction, there are several interesting games and apps designed around these themes. Here are a few notable ones from this decade:

1. **Vision Board Challenge** - This is a creative manifestation game where you gather images and affirmations that resonate with your goals and create a vision board. The idea is to visualize your dreams as already accomplished while creating the board and place it where you can see it daily to inspire action toward your goals【6†source】.

2. **The Abundance Scavenger Hunt** - This game involves making a list of items or experiences that represent abundance and then setting out to find them. This practice helps raise your awareness of the abundance around you and attracts more positive experiences into your life【6†source】.

3. **The 55×5 Method** - This manifestation practice involves choosing an affirmation related to your desires and writing it down 55 times for five days. This method focuses on feeling the emotions of having your desires already fulfilled to attract them into your life【9†source】.

4. **Law of Attraction Apps** - There are several apps designed to help with manifesting through games and tools. Apps like ThinkUp allow you to record and listen to affirmations, while others like the Law of Attraction Library provide access to classic LOA books and resources【8†source】.

These games and apps incorporate the principles of the law of attraction and can be a fun way to practice manifesting your desires. They encourage positive visualization, gratitude, and intentional action, which are all key elements in manifestation practices.
