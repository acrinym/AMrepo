There is currently no direct research specifically addressing the effects of Lion's Mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) on individuals with Cerebral Palsy (CP) in the scientific literature. However, there is promising evidence regarding its general neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties, which might be relevant.

Lion's Mane has been studied for its ability to promote nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, improve cognitive function, and reduce stress. For instance, a study found that Lion's Mane supplementation could enhance cognitive performance and reduce subjective stress in healthy adults【11†source】. Another study highlighted its potential to boost nerve growth and improve memory【10†source】.

These findings suggest that Lion's Mane might have beneficial effects on the nervous system, which could potentially translate into supportive treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders like CP. However, more targeted research is necessary to draw concrete conclusions about its efficacy for CP specifically.
