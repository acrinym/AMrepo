# New Love and Limerence

#### You:
How about writing a song about new Love and finding new Love and how it can be really exciting but also really dangerous especially if you don't know about limerence and what it means and how to enjoy the situation without that initial limerence. Please don't reuse the phrasing that I just gave you though

### **Lyrics:**

---

\[Verse 1]\
*Dangerous dance, with eyes wide open,*\
*Caught in the thrill, but emotions are spoken,*\
*This fire burns, it’s wild and untamed,*\
*But can you handle love’s dangerous game?*

---

\[Chorus]\
*It’s a high, oh, such a high,*\
*But what’s behind those starry skies?*\
*Is it real, or just a dream?*\
*Limerence, baby, it’s not what it seems.*

---

\[Verse 2]\
*New love feels like it’s here to stay,*\
*But the heart can be tricked in a thousand ways,*\
*Is it true or just a phase?*\
*Can we survive these dangerous days?*

---

\[Chorus]\
*It’s a high, oh, such a high,*\
*But what’s behind those starry skies?*\
*Is it real, or just a dream?*\
*Limerence, baby, it’s not what it seems.*

---

\[Bridge]\
*Hold on tight, don’t let go,*\
*But remember love has its highs and lows,*\
*If you want the truth, you need to see,*\
*Beyond the flames, there’s reality.*

---

\[Outro]\
*So let’s dance in this firelight,*\
*But keep our hearts in the cold night,*\
*Enjoy the thrill, but stay awake,*\
*Limerence, love, let’s not mistake.*

I'll make it more complex involving themes of learning how to understand how to deal with the relationship past that first honeymoon.

\[Verse 1]\
*We met in a whirlwind, hearts spinning fast,*\
*The thrill of the chase, we thought it would last,*\
*But now the storm has settled down,*\
*The honeymoon’s over, will we drown or stand our ground?*

---

\[Chorus]\
*When the magic fades and the fire cools,*\
*Can we find the strength to break the rules?*\
*To see beyond the first embrace,*\
*And find the love that grows with grace.*

---

\[Verse 2]\
*We’re learning now, how to navigate,*\
*Through the quiet nights and the slow debates,*\
*No longer blinded by the shine,*\
*But can we see the beauty in the grind?*

---

\[Chorus]\
*When the magic fades and the fire cools,*\
*Can we find the strength to break the rules?*\
*To see beyond the first embrace,*\
*And find the love that grows with grace.*

---

\[Bridge]\
*It’s in the silence, it’s in the strain,*\
*We learn to dance through joy and pain,*\
*Beyond the sparks, past the fire’s light,*\
*True love’s tested in the dark of night.*

---

\[Verse 3]\
*We’re writing now, a different tale,*\
*One where love is more than just the gale,*\
*We build a life, we build a home,*\
*Where love’s the anchor, not just the foam.*

---

\[Chorus]\
*When the magic fades and the fire cools,*\
*Can we find the strength to break the rules?*\
*To see beyond the first embrace,*\
*And find the love that grows with grace.*

---

\[Outro]\
*So here we stand, hand in hand,*\
*Facing the future, love’s unplanned,*\
*Beyond the thrill, beyond the race,*\
*We choose the path of steady grace.*
