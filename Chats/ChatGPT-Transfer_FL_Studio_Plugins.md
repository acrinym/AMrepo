Alright, let's get those plugins behaving like they should! Here's a step-by-step guide to move your paid FL Studio plugins to your new FL Studio version:

### Step 1: Backup Your Plugins

Before we do anything, make sure to backup your plugins and their respective licenses.

### Step 2: Install the New FL Studio Version

Ensure you have the latest version of FL Studio installed on your system.

### Step 3: Transfer Plugin Files

1. **Locate the Plugin Files**:
   - Navigate to the directory where your plugins are installed (commonly `C:\Program Files (x86)\Image-Line\FL Studio\Plugins\VST` or a custom directory if you specified one during installation).

2. **Copy Plugin Files**:
   - Copy the plugin files (DLLs, presets, etc.) from the old directory to the new FL Studio plugin directory. The new directory might be in a similar path under the new FL Studio version's folder structure.

### Step 4: License Activation

1. **Download the Latest FL Studio Installer**:
   - Go to the Image-Line website and download the latest FL Studio installer. This ensures you have the latest version of the plugins and any necessary updates.

2. **Install Plugins via the Installer**:
   - Run the installer and select the option to install the plugins. Make sure you point it to the correct FL Studio version.

3. **License Reactivation**:
   - Open FL Studio and go to the `HELP` menu, then select `About`.
   - Click `Unlock FL Studio` and log in to your Image-Line account.
   - This should reactivate all your paid plugins.

### Step 5: Rescan Plugins in FL Studio

   - Go to `Options` > `Manage Plugins`.

2. **Add Plugin Search Paths**:
   - Ensure the directory where you moved your plugins is included in the search paths.

3. **Rescan Plugins**:
   - Click on `Start scan` to refresh the list of available plugins.

### Step 6: Verify Plugin Activation

### Troubleshooting Tips:
