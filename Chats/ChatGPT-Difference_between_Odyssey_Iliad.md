#### You:
There's a movie about The Odyssey but is there one about the Iliad

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, there is a notable movie about "The Iliad." The 2004 film "Troy," directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is a loose adaptation of Homer's "The Iliad." The film stars Brad Pitt as Achilles, Eric Bana as Hector, and Orlando Bloom as Paris, among other notable actors. While "Troy" takes some creative liberties with the source material, it largely focuses on the events of the Trojan War and the key characters from "The Iliad."

The film depicts many of the central events from "The Iliad," including the abduction of Helen, the duels between Paris and Menelaus and between Achilles and Hector, and the eventual fall of Troy, which, unlike the original poem, is shown in the movie.
