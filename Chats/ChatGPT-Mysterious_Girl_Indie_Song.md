(Verse 1)
I saw her standing in the pouring rain,\
A shadow dancing through the night,\
Her eyes, like a bolt of lightning,\
Striking deep into my life.

Her hair, a cascade of shadows,\
Falling wild and free,\
Every move she made was magic,\
Every glance was destiny.

(Chorus)
She's a mystery, wrapped in whispers,\
A spark that lights the dark,\
Her eyes like a bolt of lightning,\
Her hair like a raven's arc.\
Oh, she's the storm I never saw coming,\
The calm within my heart,\
This mysterious girl, she's something,\
A living work of art.

(Verse 2)
I followed her through alleys and avenues,\
Drawn to her like a moth to flame,\
Her voice, a haunting melody,\
Calling softly, whispering my name.

She moved like a breeze on a summer night,\
Effortless and wild,\
Her laughter echoed through the silence,\
She was the storm and I, the child.

(Chorus)
She's a mystery, wrapped in whispers,\
A spark that lights the dark,\
Her eyes like a bolt of lightning,\
Her hair like a raven's arc.\
Oh, she's the storm I never saw coming,\
The calm within my heart,\
This mysterious girl, she's something,\
A living work of art.

(Bridge)
In her eyes, I saw the universe,\
A thousand stars igniting,\
In her smile, I found the peace I sought,\
An endless, warm inviting.

She disappeared into the dawn,\
Like a dream that fades away,\
But her memory lingers on,\
In my heart, she'll always stay.

(Chorus)
She's a mystery, wrapped in whispers,\
A spark that lights the dark,\
Her eyes like a bolt of lightning,\
Her hair like a raven's arc.\
Oh, she's the storm I never saw coming,\
The calm within my heart,\
This mysterious girl, she's something,\
A living work of art.

(Outro)
She's the lightning in my sky,\
The shadow in my soul,\
This mysterious girl, forever,\
She's made my broken heart whole.(Verse 1)
