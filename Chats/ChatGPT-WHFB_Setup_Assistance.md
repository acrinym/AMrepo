Question
How do I enable a user’s eAuthentication (eAuth) account when the account was previously registered?

Answer
Technical Notes
Tier 1 Solution:
 
Template: ICAM - Enabling an eAuth Account - SM 1 - Recover Internal
  
eAuth accounts will become disabled if HR data switches from Active (A). This can happen if a contract expires or if an employee with an internal account leaves, returns, or moves to another agency or duty station.

If a user reports that their eAuth account has expired or if they are getting an error message stating that they cannot log access their account, review the user’s profile to verify that it was previously registered, and the HR status is Active (A).
Log in to EIMS from Citrix.
  
On the EIMS home page, select the Menu button.
  
From the menu, select Manage Identity.
 
Select View User Helpdesk.
 
Search for the user using their first name, last name, or email address.
 
Select the magnifying glass icon at the end of the row to search for the eAuth activation date.
 
NOTE: Verify that you are speaking with the owner of the account before sending the registration/recovery email.
 
Check the Agency Status field. Accounts must be in Active (A).
If the user has an internal account that is not active and in (T) or (R) status, refer them to HR to have the status corrected.
 
If the user encounters an HR Data Mismatch error, this indicates that the birthdate or Social Security number entered does not match HR records. Refer the user to HR to have this information corrected.
 
If the account is in Active (A) status, proceed to the next step.
View the account and determine if it was previously registered. The eAuth Activation Date field will have a date entered if the account was previously registered.
 
Confirm that the user has access to the email address on the account.
If the user does not have access to the email address or if the field is blank, refer them to their Agency Registration Lead (ARL).
 
If the SM Disabled field indicates 0, the user’s account has been registered/activated and is already enabled. If they are still receiving an error message even though their account is active and enabled, ask them to reproduce it and troubleshoot accordingly.
 
If the user has access to the email address and the SM Disabled field in their account indicates 1:
Verify that the account is internal, has an activated date, and an HR status listed as Active (A).
 
Select Manage Identity.
 
Select the Send Registration/Recovery Email task.
 
Search for the user using their first name, last name, or email address.
 
Select Next. You will receive confirmation when the message has been sent to the user.
 
Select Next to return to the home page.
 
Once the user has received the email, instruct them to select the link within and input their information.
 
Assist the user with creating a password and security questions.
Once the user completes and submits the form, their account will be enabled in EIMS. If you are unable to complete the registration process and the user was not referred to their ARL or to HR, proceed to the Routing Instructions.
  
NOTE: If the user receives an error stating System is Experiencing Difficulties during this process, refer to KBA00135539: ICAM: System is Experiencing Difficulties.
  
If the user needs more information, refer them to the eAuth FAQ page.

What's the difference in the GUS and GUS2 USDA eauth protected application?

#### ChatGPT:
The Guaranteed Underwriting System (GUS) and GUS2 are both used by USDA for processing Rural Development Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loans. The primary difference between them is related to the level of security and the type of eAuthentication required. GUS uses unverified eAuth accounts, previously known as Level 1 assurance, while GUS2 requires verified eAuth accounts, formerly known as Level 2 assurance. This transition aims to enhance security by requiring users to verify their identity before accessing the system【10†source】.


#### You:
How does one get a GUS security role added to their account so they can access the application? 

#### ChatGPT:
To get a GUS security role added to your account:

1. **Create an eAuth Account:** Ensure you have a verified USDA eAuth account.
2. **Contact Security Administrator:** Reach out to your organization's Security Administrator.
3. **Access AASM:** The Security Administrator will use the Application Authorization Security Management System (AASM) to provide GUS authorization.
4. **Verification:** Complete any necessary verification steps as prompted.

For further assistance, you can contact the USDA Rural Development Help Desk or refer to internal organizational procedures.

Who is the HRIS Hunt Group?

#### ChatGPT:
The HRIS Hunt Group refers to a designated team within the Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS) division of an organization, specifically tasked with managing and troubleshooting issues related to human resources data, systems, and technology. This group ensures that HR systems are functioning correctly, addresses any technical problems users might encounter, and supports the integration and maintenance of HR software and applications. In the context of USDA, this team would handle issues related to employee records, HR data management, and access to HR-related systems.


#### You:
What is the "hunt" part? 

#### ChatGPT:
The term "hunt" in "Hunt Group" refers to a telephony feature used in call centers and help desks. A Hunt Group is a system that directs incoming calls to a designated group of phone lines or extensions. If one line is busy, the system automatically "hunts" for the next available line within the group. This ensures that calls are efficiently managed and answered, minimizing wait times for callers. In the context of the HRIS Hunt Group, it means that calls related to HRIS issues are distributed among a group of support staff, ensuring prompt assistance and resolution.


#### You:
Can you summarize both of those into something shorter I can share?

#### You:
Can you explain the OA's premise in the later seasons? Season 1 is all about being locked up, etc and what happens to Nina when she was younger, 

#### ChatGPT:
In the later seasons of "The OA," the premise expands beyond the initial story of captivity and the mysterious experiences of Nina (Prairie Johnson). Here's a concise explanation:

**Season 2:**

- **Dimension Jumping:** The story delves into the concept of parallel universes. Prairie and other characters explore the ability to travel between these dimensions.
- **New Mysteries:** Prairie adopts the identity of Nina Azarova in another dimension where she was never abducted.
- **Quest for Answers:** Prairie and her friends investigate a house that seems to be a portal to different dimensions, encountering new characters and unraveling further mysteries.

**Season 3 (if it had been produced):**

- **Expanding Multiverse:** The storyline would likely have continued to explore the multiverse, the consequences of dimension hopping, and the interconnected lives of the characters.
- **Conflict and Resolution:** Ongoing conflicts with antagonistic forces and attempts to understand and master their dimensional abilities would have been central themes.

The series shifts from the confined horror of captivity in Season 1 to a broader exploration of metaphysical concepts, relationships, and the quest for meaning across different realities in the later seasons.


#### You:
Isn't Nina actually Nina though? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, in "The OA," Nina Azarova is indeed the real identity of Prairie Johnson. Here's a clearer summary of the premise in the later seasons:

**Season 2:**

- **Revealing True Identity:** It's revealed that Prairie Johnson's true identity is Nina Azarova, which she assumes in an alternate dimension where she was never abducted.
- **Dimension Jumping:** The series delves into parallel universes, with Prairie/Nina exploring her ability to travel between these dimensions.
- **New Mysteries and Characters:** Prairie/Nina and her friends investigate strange occurrences linked to a house that acts as a portal to other dimensions, meeting new characters and uncovering deeper mysteries.

**Main Themes:**

- **Identity and Multiverse:** The story explores themes of identity and existence across multiple dimensions, with Prairie/Nina coming to terms with her true self.
- **Interconnected Lives:** The narrative emphasizes how the characters' lives are intertwined across different realities and the impact of their choices.

The later seasons expand the narrative from the personal trauma and survival story of Season 1 to a more complex and metaphysical exploration of identity, reality, and the interconnectedness of multiple dimensions.


#### You:
Is there anyone who claims to be able to do these things IRL?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, there are individuals and groups who claim to have abilities related to what is depicted in "The OA," such as dimension jumping, parallel universes, and metaphysical experiences. These claims often fall into several categories:

1. **Spiritual Practitioners:** Some spiritual and New Age practitioners claim to have experiences with alternate realities, astral projection, and interdimensional travel through meditation, rituals, or altered states of consciousness.

2. **Psychics and Mediums:** Some psychics and mediums claim they can access information from other dimensions or communicate with entities from parallel universes.

3. **Quantum Mystics:** Certain individuals who blend scientific concepts with metaphysical beliefs, often referred to as quantum mystics, assert that quantum mechanics supports the possibility of parallel universes and that consciousness can access these realms.

4. **Fringe Science Enthusiasts:** Some people on the fringes of science and pseudoscience propose theories about multiverse travel, often without mainstream scientific validation.

These claims are typically met with skepticism from the scientific community, as there is no empirical evidence supporting the ability to travel between dimensions or access parallel universes. However, these beliefs persist in various subcultures and alternative spiritual communities.
