There are many different theories as to why male and female are typically seen as the only two genders and why gender dysphoria, or the feeling of discomfort or distress due to a discrepancy between a person's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth, has become more prevalent in recent years.

One possible explanation for the binary understanding of gender is that it has been reinforced by societal norms and expectations. For much of human history, gender roles have been strictly defined and enforced, with men expected to exhibit certain traits and behaviors and women expected to exhibit others. This binary understanding of gender has been reinforced through cultural practices, laws, and social institutions.

However, it is important to note that there is a growing recognition that gender is not necessarily binary, and that people may identify as male, female, or something else entirely. This shift in understanding has been driven in part by the increasing visibility of people who do not conform to traditional gender roles and identities, as well as by a growing awareness of the complexities of gender and the diversity of human experience.

As for the increase in gender dysphoria, there are several theories as to why this might be the case. Some experts suggest that it may be due to a greater awareness and acceptance of non-binary gender identities, which has allowed more people to recognize and express their own non-binary identities. Others suggest that it may be due to an increase in social and cultural stressors, such as discrimination and marginalization, that can lead to feelings of discomfort and distress.

Regardless of the specific cause, it is clear that gender dysphoria is a real and often distressing condition that affects many people. It is important for society to recognize and support the diversity of gender identities and to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all people, regardless of their gender.
