#### You:
What? These are generic questions for management at a company that does IT. 

#### ChatGPT:
Got it—you want **sharp, situational questions** for **your context** (USDA Forest Service IT support, contractor side, high management + contract management). Let’s focus on what *really* matters in your world:

---

### Targeted Questions for **USDA Forest Service + Contract Management**

#### **1. Contract Changes & Job Security**

- **“Are there any upcoming changes to the Peckham contract or service scope that might affect day-to-day TSR responsibilities or staffing levels?”**
- **“Is there any talk about converting some roles to federal or hybrid positions, or are we staying fully contractor-based long-term?”**

#### **2. Tools & Technical Environment**

- **“Are there any upcoming technology migrations (e.g., Microsoft 365 changes, Intune expansion, MFA policies, or new USDA enterprise tools) we need to prepare for?”**
- **“What’s the timeline and strategy for addressing recurring IT pain points—like account lockouts, printer issues, or remote VPN stability?”**

#### **3. Workflow & Support Escalation**

- **“Can we streamline escalation paths for high-impact issues (like CEC users or supervisors), so Tier 1 TSRs don’t get stuck waiting for Tier 2 feedback?”**
- **“Is there a plan for improving ticket visibility and customer feedback, especially when end users request updates on unresolved issues?”**

#### **4. Training & Professional Growth**

- **“Will there be more training for USDA-specific systems (like ADFS, Forest Service custom apps, or ServiceNow updates) so TSRs can resolve more tickets without escalation?”**
- **“Is there any support for professional certifications or USDA-specific IT knowledge (e.g., security awareness beyond annual federal training)?”**

#### **5. Communication & Process Improvements**

- **“How does leadership want TSRs to handle user expectations when USDA-wide outages occur—are we free to communicate proactively, or should messaging stay centralized?”**
- **“Can we have a clearer feedback channel from USDA high management back to contract TSRs, so we understand which KPIs or user satisfaction metrics are driving decisions?”**

Do you want me to also make **a one-page cheat sheet** you can glance at right before the meeting (like quick-hit questions + blank space for notes)?\
Also—do you want a **neutral tone** (safe & practical) or a **career-impact tone** (positioning you as someone who thinks beyond the helpdesk)?
