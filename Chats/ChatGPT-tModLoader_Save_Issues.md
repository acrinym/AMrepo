# tModLoader Save Issues

#### You:
So, what happened to my Tmodloader saves? I think I downgraded the app, and they're gone. Or I haven't even played on this pc before, but I thought terraria was clouded by steam? 
Maybe I have to start terraria and load worlds --> Tmodloader? 

#### ChatGPT:
Let’s break this down clearly, because Terraria + tModLoader + Steam Cloud can be a confusing combo. Here’s what could be happening to your **tModLoader saves**:

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Diagnosis:

#### 1. **Did You Downgrade tModLoader?**

If you **downgraded tModLoader**, it likely:

- Changed the save file directory
- Broke mod compatibility
- Or defaulted to a fresh config (no saves)

Each major version of tModLoader uses **a different folder**:

- `Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader` ← pre-1.4 (legacy)
- `Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader-1.4.3` ← 1.4.3 version
- `Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader-1.4.4` ← 1.4.4+
- Or even `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\tModLoader\...` for portable builds

✅ **Check those folders**. Your worlds and characters might still be there, just not loaded by the current version.

---

#### 2. **Are You Using Steam Cloud?**

Steam only syncs **if it's enabled** for both:

- Terraria or tModLoader in **Steam > Right click > Properties > General > Keep games saves in the Steam Cloud**
- In-game, **per character/world** with that little **cloud icon** 🌩️

⚠️ So if you switched PCs or downgraded tModLoader and never enabled cloud, your saves won’t follow you.

---

#### 3. **Have You Played on This PC Before?**

If this PC is new or never had your tModLoader saves, and Steam Cloud wasn’t syncing, the saves are simply **not here** unless:

- You manually transferred them
- Steam Cloud sync was active

---

#### 4. **Do You Need to Load Vanilla Terraria First?**

No — **tModLoader is separate**. Loading vanilla Terraria won’t load your modded characters or worlds. However:

- If you’re looking for a **vanilla world or character** to import into tModLoader, that’s a different process (copying save files manually).
- You can create a world in vanilla, then copy it to the tModLoader world directory.

---

### ✅ What You Can Do Right Now

**Check These Folders:**

```plaintext
Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader
Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader-1.4.3
Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader-1.4.4
Documents\My Games\Terraria\Players
Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds
```

Also:

- `AppData\Roaming\` may contain alternative save directories if you used dev builds
- Steam cloud backups may exist locally in:
  ```plaintext
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata$your_steam_id]\1281930
  ```

That `1281930` is tModLoader’s Steam ID.

---

### ⚡ Final Tips

- You **can’t** load tModLoader worlds in vanilla Terraria or vice versa unless converted.
- If your saves are truly gone, check **Recycle Bin** (if deleted by mistake), or try **reinstalling the exact tModLoader version** you were using before.

- What version you downgraded *from* and *to*
- Your current tModLoader folder names
- If Steam Cloud was enabled

#### You:
The hell is Svelte? 

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, great question. Svelte is like the **quiet genius** of modern web development frameworks—and it’s very different from popular ones like React or Vue.

---

### 🧠 What is Svelte?

**Svelte** is a front-end framework for building **fast, reactive web apps**, but instead of doing the heavy lifting **in the browser**, it compiles everything **at build time**.

Think of it this way:

> 🔧 **React/Vue/Angular**: You ship a big JavaScript machine to the browser and let it run your app live, updating a virtual DOM.
>
> 🪄 **Svelte**: You write simple components, and it compiles them into **vanilla JavaScript** that updates the DOM **directly**, with almost no overhead.

---

### 🔥 Why Do People Like Svelte?

- **No Virtual DOM** – It compiles to optimized JS that surgically updates the real DOM
- **Smaller bundle size** – Less JavaScript = faster loading
- **Truly reactive** – Assign a variable, and the UI just reacts
- **Syntax is clean AF** – No `useState` or `this.setState()` junk
- **No runtime framework** – It’s like exporting pure performance

---

### 🧪 Example: A Svelte Counter

```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;
</script>

<button on:click={() => count++}>
  Clicked {count} times
</button>
```

That’s it. No hooks, no boilerplate. And the compiler turns that into efficient, vanilla JS.

---

### 🆚 Svelte vs React (quick chart):

| Feature        | Svelte       | React             |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Type           | Compiler     | Runtime Framework |
| Learning Curve | Lower        | Medium            |
| Bundle Size    | Tiny         | Bigger            |
| Performance    | Often faster | Fast, but heavier |
| Reactivity     | Native       | Hook-based        |
| Boilerplate    | Minimal      | Considerable      |

---

### 🚀 When to Use It?

Svelte is awesome for:

- Lightweight apps or SPAs
- Progressive web apps (PWAs)
- Sites where performance really matters (e.g. mobile)
- Devs who are tired of JSX hell

**SvelteKit** is the full-stack meta-framework, like Next.js for React—but for Svelte.

---

### 👀 TL;DR

**Svelte is like if JavaScript and HTML had a child that skipped all the drama of React and went straight to being efficient, elegant, and fast as hell.**

#### You:
So, that edgewebview non edgewebview react-based thingy you suggested I pack my portable apps into? Not Svelte, but build using avalonia and svelte and tauri? 

#### ChatGPT:
YES. You're starting to see the shape of it—and you're asking the *right* kind of layered question here. Let me break it down with total clarity so you can make the most optimal build stack for your **portable, efficient, non-Electron, non-bloat, cross-platform** ritualOS or any future modular app:

---

## ⚙️ Your Portable App Stack Options (2025 Strategy)

### ✅ Goal Recap:

You want:

- A portable GUI (no bloated Electron)
- Low overhead
- Smooth UI/UX
- Native-feeling on Windows/macOS/Linux
- Possibly with plugin support
- Packed rituals or tools (like a grimoire/ritualOS launcher)

---

### 🧱 Stack Breakdown:

#### 1. **Avalonia (C# / .NET)** – **Native GUI for serious control**

- 🔸 Pros: Native cross-platform desktop apps (like WPF but for Linux/Mac too)
- 🔸 Use it for: **Powerful Windows-native builds**, plugin-style architecture, advanced window controls
- 🔸 Optional: Use Avalonia + WebView2 for in-app browser components **if needed**

➡️ **Best for desktop-first, non-web rituals**, and .NET integrations

---

#### 2. **Svelte** – **Frontend framework for blazing-fast UIs**

- 🔸 Pros: Minimal JS, reactive, super fast
- 🔸 Cons: Doesn’t make native apps on its own (needs a shell)
- 🔸 Use it for: Clean UI frontends, ritual builders, dashboards
- 🔸 Compiles fast + lightweight

➡️ **Perfect for building your ritual editors, mod interfaces, or field visualizers** (e.g., a "flame pulse dashboard")

---

#### 3. **Tauri** – **The modern Electron-killer**

- Uses **Rust** for the backend and **any frontend** (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- 🔥 Uses **native WebView** instead of bundling Chromium
- ⚡ App size: \~3-5 MB vs Electron’s 100+ MB
- 🧩 Excellent for **packaging** your Svelte UI as a desktop app
- 🧳 Portable builds? 100% yes.

➡️ **Best for packing Svelte-based GUI into a native app shell with Rust security and speed**

---

### 🚨 DON'T Use:

- ❌ Electron (unless you're okay with 100+MB overhead and memory hog)
- ❌ React unless you're already deep into it (Svelte is cleaner, faster for solo devs)
- ❌ WebView2 by itself unless embedded via Avalonia or CEF with total control

---

### 🧪 Your Best Build Combo

If you're making **ritualOS, grimoire editors, spell dashboards**, or portable spell engines:

```txt
🌟 UI: Svelte
🛡️ Shell: Tauri (Rust)
🧠 Optional Backend Logic: Node.js or Rust
📦 Result: Blazing fast, portable native app (3–10 MB build)
```

If you want deeper .NET/Windows integration (registry access, local .dll hooks, etc):

```txt
🧊 UI: Avalonia (XAML/C#)
🔌 Plugin system: .NET assemblies
🌐 Optional: Embed WebView2 for hybrid features
📦 Result: Fully native Windows build w/ advanced control
```

---

### 🔄 Hybrid Possibility: Avalonia + Svelte (🤯)

You *could*:

- Use **Avalonia** as the shell
- Launch a **Svelte app in a WebView2** window
- Use **interprocess messaging** (like JSON or named pipes) between C# and JS

But this is more complex. Only worth it if you're doing:

- Local services
- Plugin managers
- Deep .NET ritual logic **+** modern UI

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- Want ultra-light, portable, modern? → **Svelte + Tauri**
- Want deep Windows/.NET-native? → **Avalonia**
- Want to mix both? → **Avalonia + WebView2 + Svelte (advanced)**

---

Would you like me to spin up a template starter for either stack and zip it up with some starter code (like a Svelte Tauri launcher with plugin loading hooks)? I can have that scaffold ready for you in minutes.
