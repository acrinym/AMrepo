# Songs for Leaving Nina

#### You:
So I need a song to give to Nina like "see you again" but one that doesn't imply she died in the song. It's perfect except that part. Songs for after I leave that tell her it's not like I don't think about her or life is perfect, but that I'm going through my own struggle. (Ps I haven't left yet, I'm preparing to do so)

A song that might work for what you're looking for is *"Happier"* by Marshmello ft. Bastille. The lyrics convey a sense of knowing that both people need to move forward separately for their own growth and happiness, without implying that one of them has passed away. It carries an acknowledgment of the love and memories, but also a bittersweet acceptance of needing to part ways for personal reasons.

Another option is *"Let Her Go"* by Passenger. While it’s reflective and melancholic, it captures the idea that leaving doesn’t erase the feelings or the memories.

If you want something a bit more introspective, *"Lost in Japan"* by Shawn Mendes has a slightly more upbeat vibe but could imply that though you're apart, you're not completely gone from each other’s thoughts.

Does the tone of any of these resonate with what you’d like to express to Nina, or would you prefer something with a different style or emotion?
