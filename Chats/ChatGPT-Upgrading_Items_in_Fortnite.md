Upgrading items in *Fortnite: Save the World* can be a bit confusing at first, but here's how you can do it:

1. **Go to the Armory Tab**: From the main menu, click on the 'Armory' tab.

2. **Select the Item You Want to Upgrade**: In the Armory, you can choose from a variety of items like weapons, traps, or heroes. Select the type of item you want to upgrade.

3. **Manage Inventory**: Once you’re in the specific section (Weapons, Traps, or Heroes), find the item you want to upgrade. Click on it to bring up its details.

4. **Upgrade/Inspect**: There should be an 'Upgrade/Inspect' button when you select an item. This allows you to see the details of the item and begin the upgrade process.

5. **Upgrade Level**: If you want to upgrade the item’s level, you can do so by spending *XP* points and other materials like weapon or trap designs. Each level upgrade makes the item more powerful.

6. **Evolve**: After reaching a certain level (usually at level 10, 20, etc.), you can evolve the item to increase its star rating. This process will cost additional resources like Evolution Materials and requires certain player level requirements to be met.

7. **Perks**: You can also upgrade individual perks on weapons or traps using *Re-perk* and *Perk-Up* materials. This can be done in the 'Modify Perks' section.

8. **Confirm the Upgrade**: Once you’ve allocated your resources for upgrading, confirm the upgrade to see the changes reflected in your item.

If you're not seeing the 'Upgrade/Inspect' option, make sure you're selecting an item that can be upgraded and that you're in the correct part of the Armory.

If you're still having trouble finding these options, let me know which specific item you're trying to upgrade, and I can guide you through that particular process.

No upgrade or spend points button

Thanks for sharing the screenshot! From what I see, you're viewing the schematic details of a *Ceiling Drop Trap* in the Armory. The 'Upgrade/Inspect' button should usually appear here, but since it's not visible, it's possible that your character level or schematic level might not be high enough for upgrades, or there could be some other reason.

Here’s what you can try next:

1. **Check Schematic Level**: Ensure that the schematic is at least Level 1. Sometimes, the option to upgrade only appears when you reach a certain level threshold.

2. **Check Your Resources**: Make sure you have enough resources like *XP* and materials (weapon or trap designs) to perform the upgrade. If you don’t have enough resources, the option might not appear.

3. **Go to the Collection Book**: Sometimes, you can upgrade schematics from the Collection Book instead of the Armory. See if that works.

4. **Check the Top Right Menu**: Sometimes, the upgrade option can be accessed through the small menu in the top-right corner of the screen.

5. **Restart the Game**: If none of the above works, try restarting the game. Occasionally, game updates or minor glitches can temporarily disable some features.

Let me know if any of these suggestions work, or if you encounter any other issues!Thanks for sharing the screenshot!

Maybe I need to do this first?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, it looks like you need to progress further in the main questline to unlock more features and abilities, including upgrading items. The quest you're on, "Gimme Three," is part of the Stonewood questline, and completing it might unlock additional functionality in the game, including the ability to upgrade your schematics.

It’s a good idea to complete the quest "Gimme Three" and possibly other quests that follow. These quests often serve as tutorials, gradually introducing new features and mechanics as you progress. Once you've completed the required quests, try going back to the Armory to see if the upgrade option appears.

If you run into any issues or have more questions as you continue, feel free to ask!
