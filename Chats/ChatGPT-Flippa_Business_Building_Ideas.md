Building something to sell on Flippa can be relatively straightforward, but the ease depends on the type of project you have in mind. Flippa is a marketplace for buying and selling online businesses, websites, and digital assets, so what you build needs to have value to potential buyers.

Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Content Websites**: This involves building a blog or niche site with some amount of content (articles, reviews, guides, etc.) targeting a specific audience or SEO keywords. These are relatively simple to set up using platforms like WordPress, and their value increases if you can show traffic and a monetization strategy (ads, affiliate links).

2. **E-commerce Sites**: You could set up a dropshipping store or a small-scale e-commerce operation using platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce. The appeal of e-commerce sites often comes down to how established the business is—such as its sales history, profit margins, and the strength of supplier relationships.

3. **SaaS/Apps**: Building a simple SaaS (Software as a Service) or app might be more technical but can generate higher selling prices on Flippa. This usually requires either coding skills or hiring a developer, and it needs to solve a specific problem or meet a demand to attract buyers.

4. **Digital Products**: Another option is creating a business around selling digital products (eBooks, courses, digital art, etc.). These can be sold with little overhead and tend to have passive income potential, which buyers often look for.

If you're looking for something to throw together quickly, a content-based site or a basic e-commerce site could be your best bet. It’s about establishing proof of concept, showing some level of traffic or income, and being transparent about growth potential. It can be relatively easy if you're familiar with website builders, SEO, and digital marketing.

What do you and Ron have in mind for this?
