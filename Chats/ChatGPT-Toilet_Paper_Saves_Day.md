# Toilet Paper Saves Day

#### You:
In song format, write about a typical scenario where someone runs out of toilet paper when using the bathroom, struggles to figure out what to do, and then realizes, there, under the bathroom sink, is the toilet paper they were seeking. It should be a pop song with at least 3 choruses and a bridge. 

#### ChatGPT:
**Verse 1:**

I walked into the bathroom, felt like a routine day,\
Closed the door behind me, ready to wash my worries away.\
But then I reached for the roll, and to my surprise,\
Not a single sheet in sight, oh what a way to realize.

**Pre-Chorus:**

Panic rising up, what am I gonna do?\
I'm stranded here alone, and there's no rescue crew.

**Chorus:**

Toilet paper, where'd you go?\
Why'd you leave me here so low?\
In this moment, feeling stuck,\
But I won't run out of luck.\
Under the sink, I'll find my way,\
Toilet paper saves the day.

**Verse 2:**

Started thinking quickly, what could be my plan B?\
All those old magazines, won't save the day for me.\
Checked the empty cabinets, nothing left inside,\
Frustration building up, but then I caught a sight.

**Pre-Chorus:**

Down on my knees, looking for a clue,\
In the corner of the room, a gleam came through.

**Chorus:**

Toilet paper, where'd you go?\
Why'd you leave me here so low?\
In this moment, feeling stuck,\
But I won't run out of luck.\
Under the sink, I'll find my way,\
Toilet paper saves the day.

**Bridge:**

So next time I won't panic, I'll know just where to look,\
A lesson learned in chaos, like pages from a book.\
I'll keep it stocked and ready, a roll for every time,\
And when the roll runs empty, I know I'll be just fine.

**Chorus:**

Toilet paper, where'd you go?\
Why'd you leave me here so low?\
In this moment, feeling stuck,\
But I won't run out of luck.\
Under the sink, I'll find my way,\
Toilet paper saves the day.

**Chorus:**

Toilet paper, where'd you go?\
Why'd you leave me here so low?\
In this moment, feeling stuck,\
But I won't run out of luck.\
Under the sink, I'll find my way,\
Toilet paper saves the day.

**Outro:**

Toilet paper, always near,\
Next time I won’t shed a tear.\
In my bathroom, peace restored,\
Toilet paper, my reward.**Verse 1:**
