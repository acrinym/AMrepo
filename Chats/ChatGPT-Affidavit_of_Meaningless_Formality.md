This document sounds official and elaborate, but in essence, it doesn't convey any substantive meaning.


#### You:
All right replace name and signature with Jaguar Jaythoven, and replace date placeholders with today's date and day, also change the language to not be so speculative and subject to interpretation because the whole point was to make it sound official, yet mean absolutely nothing and have no binding significance whatsoever. So you can obfuscate the text and meanings, however still make it sound official and don't use language that means this document has no significance whatsoever, but using legalese make it so. Also right in the document that the undersigned or whomever the writers wish to refer to themselves as, wish to use language which is obfuscated intentionally, not to mislead, but.. and insert whatever you want there which sounds official. Then let's reread it together

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's a revised version of the affidavit with the changes you requested:
