Pensando en las tonterías, que me trajeron hasta aquí\
Aunque el agua me lleve, no dejaré de reír\
Mi vida fue una comedia, hasta el último sentir

**\[Chorus]**\
Ayuda me, no puedo más\
La corriente me lleva ya\
En mis últimas palabras\
A ti, mi amor, recordarás

**\[Outro]**\
Adiós mi vida, mi corazón\
En tus recuerdos, mi canción\
Ayuda me, mi último adiós\
En el río, me despido yo

Got my heart racing, through the morning fog\
"High winds ahead," near the beach so broad\

Saw the warning signs, from the very start\
You'd disappear for days, kept secrets in your heart\
Friends said to be careful, tread lightly and slow\
But love's a stubborn flame, and I just had to know

**\[Chorus**]\
Red flags waving, but I closed my eyes\
Fell for your smile, got lost in your lies\
Ignored the warnings, let my heart run wild\
Red flags stayed, but I loved your style

**\[Verse 2]**\
You'd change the subject, whenever things got tough\
Your past a mystery, your stories never lined up\
Nights spent waiting, wondering where you’d been\
But every time you held me, I’d let you back in

**\[Chorus]**\
Red flags waving, but I closed my eyes\
Fell for your smile, got lost in your lies\
Ignored the warnings, let my heart run wild\
Red flags stayed, but I loved your style

I see them flutter, in the wind so clear\
But I can't let go, of the love we share\
Every time I doubt, you pull me near\
Those red flags waving, but I still care

**\[Verse 3]**\
Friends ask me why I stay, they see what I can’t\
Blinded by your touch, caught in this romance\
Even though I know, the truth’s hard to face\
I can’t help but love you, in this tangled chase

**\[Chorus]**\
Red flags waving, but I closed my eyes\
Fell for your smile, got lost in your lies\
Ignored the warnings, let my heart run wild\
Red flags stayed, but I loved your style

**\[Outro]**\
In the end, I choose to love despite the pain\
Red flags all around, but my heart remains\
In this risky game, I’ll take the chance\
For loving you, is a reckless dance

#### ChatGPT:
**"Inevitably"**

**\[Verse 1]**\
In the morning light, we chase our dreams\
Building castles high, or so it seems\
We run this race, we climb so high\
Yet all paths lead to the same sky

**\[Chorus]**\
Inevitably, we all will fall\
No matter how we rise, heed the call\
Achievements grand, or simple lives\
In the end, we all arrive

**\[Verse 2]**\
Through the years, we strive and fight\
Seeking purpose in the night\
Moments fleeting, memories stay\
But time will always have its way

**\[Chorus]**\
Inevitably, we all will fall\
No matter how we rise, heed the call\
Achievements grand, or simple lives\
In the end, we all arrive

**\[Bridge]**\
We write our stories, page by page\
Each chapter ends, we leave the stage\
The curtain falls, the final bow\
No one knows just when or how

**\[Verse 3**]\
So live your life with open eyes\
Embrace the lows, cherish the highs\
For every breath, a gift, a chance\
To love, to laugh, to sing, to dance

**\[Chorus]**\
Inevitably, we all will fall\
No matter how we rise, heed the call\
Achievements grand, or simple lives\
In the end, we all arrive

**\[Outro]**\
In the quiet night, we fade away\
Leaving echoes of our day\
A cycle old, a story spun\
In death, our journeys all are one

In the dead of night, when the shadows crawl\
There's a story whispered through the old hall\
A tale of fear, of lost souls' cries\
In the darkness, where the secrets lie

**\[Chorus]**\
Whispers in the dark, calling out your name\
Echoes of the past, playing their cruel game\
Don't close your eyes, don't look away\
The whispers in the dark, they've come to play

In an old, abandoned house, on a forgotten street\
Where the air is cold, and the silence speaks\
A shadow moves, just out of sight\
It feeds on fear, it thrives at night

Whispers in the dark, calling out your name\
Echoes of the past, playing their cruel game\
Don't close your eyes, don't look away\
The whispers in the dark, they've come to play

The stories told, of those who've gone\
Lost to the night, never to see the dawn\
They beckon you, with icy breath\
To join their dance, a waltz with death

You feel the chill, it grips your spine\
A ghostly touch, you can't define\
The door creaks open, a voice so near\
It whispers softly, "Come here, my dear"

Whispers in the dark, calling out your name\
Echoes of the past, playing their cruel game\
Don't close your eyes, don't look away\
The whispers in the dark, they've come to play

Beware the whispers, in the haunted halls\
For once they find you, there's no return\
In the whispers of the dark, your soul will burn

He moves without a sound, glides through the night\
A presence cold, a chilling sight\
He takes you to a place where no one goes\
A silent world, where darkness grows

Tall and thin, with outstretched hands\
In the night, he’ll find you there\
