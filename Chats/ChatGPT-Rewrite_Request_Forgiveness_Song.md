El agua me arrastra, no sÃ© nadar muy bien\
Pero antes de irme, cantarÃ© mi gran desdÃ©n

Ayuda me, no puedo mÃ¡s\
La corriente me lleva ya\
En mis Ãºltimas palabras\
A ti, mi amor, recordarÃ¡s

**\[Verse 2]**\
La vida es tan irÃ³nica, me rÃ­o sin parar\
AquÃ­ estoy atrapado, sin nadie que ayudar\
El rÃ­o sigue y sigue, y yo flotando voy\
Pero no te preocupes, mi humor no lo pierdo hoy

**\[Chorus]**\
Ayuda me, no puedo mÃ¡s\
La corriente me lleva ya\
En mis Ãºltimas palabras\
A ti, mi amor, recordarÃ¡s

**\[Bridge]**\
El sol se pone, el agua sube, y yo sigo aquÃ­\
Pensando en las tonterÃ­as, que me trajeron hasta aquÃ­\
Aunque el agua me lleve, no dejarÃ© de reÃ­r\
Mi vida fue una comedia, hasta el Ãºltimo sentir

**\[Chorus]**\
Ayuda me, no puedo mÃ¡s\
La corriente me lleva ya\
En mis Ãºltimas palabras\
A ti, mi amor, recordarÃ¡s

Friends said to be careful, tread lightly and slow\
But love's a stubborn flame, and I just had to know

Red flags waving, but I closed my eyes\
Fell for your smile, got lost in your lies\
Ignored the warnings, let my heart run wild\
Red flags stayed, but I loved your style

**\[Verse 2]**\
You'd change the subject, whenever things got tough\
Your past a mystery, your stories never lined up\
Nights spent waiting, wondering where youâ€™d been\
But every time you held me, Iâ€™d let you back in

Red flags waving, but I closed my eyes\
Fell for your smile, got lost in your lies\
Ignored the warnings, let my heart run wild\

But I can't let go, of the love we share\
Every time I doubt, you pull me near\
Those red flags waving, but I still care

Friends ask me why I stay, they see what I canâ€™t\
Blinded by your touch, caught in this romance\
Even though I know, the truthâ€™s hard to face\
I canâ€™t help but love you, in this tangled chase

Red flags waving, but I closed my eyes\
Fell for your smile, got lost in your lies\

#### ChatGPT:
**"Inevitably"**

**\[Verse 1]**\
In the morning light, we chase our dreams\
Building castles high, or so it seems\
We run this race, we climb so high\
Yet all paths lead to the same sky

**\[Chorus]**\
Inevitably, we all will fall\
No matter how we rise, heed the call\
Achievements grand, or simple lives\
In the end, we all arrive

**\[Verse 2]**\
Through the years, we strive and fight\
Seeking purpose in the night\
Moments fleeting, memories stay\
But time will always have its way

**\[Chorus]**\
Inevitably, we all will fall\
No matter how we rise, heed the call\
Achievements grand, or simple lives\
In the end, we all arrive

**\[Bridge]**\
We write our stories, page by page\
Each chapter ends, we leave the stage\
The curtain falls, the final bow\
No one knows just when or how

**\[Verse 3**]\
So live your life with open eyes\
Embrace the lows, cherish the highs\
For every breath, a gift, a chance\
To love, to laugh, to sing, to dance

**\[Chorus]**\
Inevitably, we all will fall\
No matter how we rise, heed the call\
Achievements grand, or simple lives\
In the end, we all arrive

**\[Outro]**\
In the quiet night, we fade away\
Leaving echoes of our day\
A cycle old, a story spun\
In death, our journeys all are one

**"Whispers in the Dark"**

**\[Verse 1]**\
In the dead of night, when the shadows crawl\
There's a story whispered through the old hall\
A tale of fear, of lost souls' cries\
In the darkness, where the secrets lie

**\[Chorus]**\
Whispers in the dark, calling out your name\
Echoes of the past, playing their cruel game\
Don't close your eyes, don't look away\
The whispers in the dark, they've come to play

In an old, abandoned house, on a forgotten street\
Where the air is cold, and the silence speaks\
A shadow moves, just out of sight\
It feeds on fear, it thrives at night

Whispers in the dark, calling out your name\
Echoes of the past, playing their cruel game\
Don't close your eyes, don't look away\
The whispers in the dark, they've come to play

The stories told, of those who've gone\
Lost to the night, never to see the dawn\
They beckon you, with icy breath\
To join their dance, a waltz with death

**\[Verse 3]**\
You feel the chill, it grips your spine\
A ghostly touch, you can't define\
The door creaks open, a voice so near\
It whispers softly, "Come here, my dear"

Whispers in the dark, calling out your name\
Echoes of the past, playing their cruel game\
Don't close your eyes, don't look away\
The whispers in the dark, they've come to play

So heed this warning, when night falls\
Beware the whispers, in the haunted halls\
For once they find you, there's no return\
In the whispers of the dark, your soul will burn

Tall and thin, with outstretched hands\
In the night, heâ€™ll find you there\

Tall and thin, with outstretched hands\

He moves without a sound, glides through the night\
A presence cold, a chilling sight\
He takes you to a place where no one goes\
A silent world, where darkness grows

Tall and thin, with outstretched hands\
In the night, heâ€™ll find you there\
