# Steam Key Protection Tips

#### You:
Is there a way that Ayden can export his Steam keys to unpurchased or something so that his account isn't shut down by his parents after he leaves with the PPO? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, there are a few ways Ayden can protect his **Steam keys** or **owned games** from being lost or revoked if his account is at risk due to a parent-controlled environment. Here's a detailed breakdown of options and limits:

---

## 🔐 **Understanding Steam Game Ownership**

1. **Games Purchased on Steam** are tied **permanently** to the Steam account—not exportable as keys once redeemed.
2. If Ayden used Steam keys (e.g. from Humble Bundle, Fanatical, etc.) and **hasn’t redeemed them yet**, those keys *can* be exported and used elsewhere.
3. **Steam does not allow un-redeeming** games that are already tied to an account.

## ✅ **Actions Ayden Can Take Now**

### ⚠️ Step 1: Secure the Steam Account

- **Change the account email** to one his parents cannot access.
- **Enable Steam Guard** with a phone number **he controls**.
- **Change the password** and revoke any authorized devices via:
  > Steam → Settings → Account → Manage Steam Guard

> 🔒 *This prevents unauthorized access or remote revocation.*

---

### 🔄 Step 2: Export or Recover Unused Keys

If he used services like **Humble Bundle**:

- Go to [Humble Bundle Library](https://www.humblebundle.com/home/keys)
- Export any **unused** keys before anything happens.
- If the Steam key **was claimed**, it can't be revoked or reused.

---

### 💡 Step 3: Backup Game Data (Optional)

While you can't "export" games, you can:

- **Backup game files** via Steam’s own tool:
  > Steam → Library → Right-click game → Properties → Installed Files → Backup
- Useful if he re-logins on a new PC later.

---

## 🧠 Contingency Plan: Create a New Steam Account

If Ayden suspects the account might be deleted or access lost:

- He can **create a new account now**, and keep it secret.
- Some games from third-party bundles may still offer **gifting** options or separate keys.
- **Family Sharing** may be a temporary fix, but it's risky if the originating account is compromised.

---

## 🚫 If the Parents Paid for the Games

Technically, under Steam’s ToS, the account belongs to the person whose payment method and email were used. This could be a legal grey area. If possible:

- Have Ayden email Steam Support and explain the situation *carefully* (e.g., abuse context, PPO).
- Request account migration or lockout of parent access due to safety concerns. They *have* honored such requests in rare cases.
