### **Route Guide with a Transport Bike**

1. **Leaving the Mountain Knot Distribution Center**:
   - Exit toward the **southeast** and aim for a clear route down the mountains.
   - Stick to **paved roads or paths** if available, as they’re ideal for bikes.

     - Use **boosts carefully** to climb steep slopes but be mindful of energy usage.

3. **BT Zones**:
   - If you enter a BT zone:
     - Slow down and activate **Odradek** to detect BTs.
     - Move cautiously or use hematic grenades to clear BTs ahead.
     - If grabbed, quickly accelerate or dismount to fight.

4. **Crossing Rivers or Streams**:
   - For shallow rivers, use the bike’s boost to traverse quickly.
   - For deep rivers, dismount and carry your bike using the **floating carrier** to avoid losing it.

5. **Approaching Heartman’s Lab**:
   - As you descend toward the lake:
     - Use **climbing anchors or ladders** for steep descents if the bike can't manage it.
     - If the terrain is too hazardous for the bike, park it safely and walk the rest of the way.

### **Tips for Efficient Delivery**

- **Stay in the Chiral Network**:
  - Use player-built structures like bridges or ziplines where possible.
