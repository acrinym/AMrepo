# Python ADB File Management

#### You:
One more thing I'd like to do. Can I use Python to manage my Android file system via USB plug into my computer? We can make a gui tool, or maybe if I somehow give you a file structure of my device, then you can tell me what you would change etc. But I don't know how to exactly get a file structure like a tree of the dir/p  based on the fact that it's an ADB device

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, you **can use Python to manage your Android file system over USB via ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach it and how to get that tree structure you're talking about:

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**

#### Prerequisites:

- **Enable Developer Mode on your Android device**
- **Turn on USB Debugging**
- **Install ADB on your computer**
- `adb` must be accessible from the command line.

#### Python Libraries You'll Need:

- `subprocess` (built-in, for ADB calls)
- `os` (built-in, for handling local paths)
- Optionally: `PySimpleGUI` or `Tkinter` for GUI

---

### **Step 2: Python + ADB = File System Access**

Here's how to list files from the Android device using ADB with Python:

```python
import subprocess

def list_android_directory(adb_path="/sdcard/", depth=2):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["adb", "shell", f"find {adb_path} -maxdepth {depth} -type d"],
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True
        )
        if result.stderr:
            print("Error:", result.stderr)
        return result.stdout.strip().split("\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception:", e)

dirs = list_android_directory()
for d in dirs:
    print(d)
```

---

### **Step 3: Generate a Directory Tree**

To create a visual tree of the directory like `tree` on Linux:

```python
def generate_tree(adb_path="/sdcard/", max_depth=2):
    command = f'adb shell find {adb_path} -maxdepth {max_depth} -type d'
    output = subprocess.check_output(command.split()).decode()
    lines = output.strip().split('\n')
    root_len = len(adb_path.rstrip('/').split('/'))

    tree = ""
    for path in lines:
        parts = path.strip().split('/')
        indent = "  " * (len(parts) - root_len)
        tree += f"{indent}- {parts[-1]}\n"
    return tree

print(generate_tree())
```

---

### **Step 4: Make a GUI Tool (Optional)**

If you want, I can help build a simple desktop GUI that:

- Connects via ADB
- Displays the directory tree
- Lets you copy/paste/delete files from your Android device

We can use **Tkinter**, **PySimpleGUI**, or **Electron + Python backend** for that.

---

### Next Steps?

1. Want me to build a minimal GUI app for this?
2. Would you like help dumping your current file structure so I can analyze it?
3. Want this to also do local file syncing or just Android-side browsing?

Perfect. Let's dump your current Android file structure via ADB so I can analyze it and help you build a tool or script that fits your needs.

---

### **How to Dump Your File Structure (Simple Steps)**

1. **Plug your Android device into your computer via USB**

2. Make sure `adb` is installed and working:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
   You should see your device listed.

3. **Run the following command to dump the file tree:**

   ```bash
   adb shell find /sdcard -type d > android_dirs.txt
   ```

   This will:

   - Recursively list all directories under `/sdcard`
   - Save the results to `android_dirs.txt` (on your PC)

4. (Optional but recommended) **Also get a list of files with size info:**
   ```bash
   adb shell ls -lR /sdcard > android_files.txt
   ```

---

### **Once You Have Those Files:**

You can now **upload `android_dirs.txt` and/or `android_files.txt` here**, and I will:

- Analyze the structure
- Help you build a **Python-based directory browser**
- Offer suggestions for cleaning, sorting, renaming, or automating parts of your Android file system

Whenever you're ready, drop the file(s) here and we’ll start building from there. Want a sample tree parser ready in the meantime?
