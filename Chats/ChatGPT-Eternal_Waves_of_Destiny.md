(Verse 1)  
In the quiet of the night, we find our way,  
Through the endless skies, we drift away,  
Feel the pulse beneath our feet,  
In this moment, hearts will meet.

(Chorus)  
Eternal waves, we ride the tide,  
Across the stars, where dreams collide,  
Infinite light, we’re sailing free,  
In this journey, our destiny.

(Verse 2)  
Shadows fade as dawn draws near,  
In this rhythm, lose all fear,  
Whispers of a distant shore,  
Guiding us forevermore.

(Chorus)  
Eternal waves, we ride the tide,  
Across the stars, where dreams collide,  
Infinite light, we’re sailing free,  
In this journey, our destiny.

(Bridge)  
Through the echoes of time, we’ll fly,  
Boundless love, as the world goes by,  
Feel the surge, the energy,  
Together, we’re eternity.

(Chorus)  
Eternal waves, we ride the tide,  
Across the stars, where dreams collide,  
Infinite light, we’re sailing free,  
In this journey, our destiny.

(Outro)  
As the music fades, we'll know,  
In our hearts, the beat will grow,  
Eternal waves, forever high,  
In this moment, we touch the sky.
