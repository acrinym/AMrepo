#### You:
Can I transcribe files that already exist with Google recorder or live transcribe

#### ChatGPT:
Google Recorder and Live Transcribe are primarily designed for real-time transcription, but their capabilities for pre-existing audio files vary:

### **Google Recorder:**

- **Pre-existing Files:** Unfortunately, Google Recorder does not natively support uploading and transcribing pre-recorded audio files like MP3s.
- **Workaround:** You can play the audio on another device and record it using Google Recorder on your phone to transcribe the playback in real-time. While not ideal, it can be an effective solution.

### **Live Transcribe & Sound Notifications:**

- **Pre-existing Files:** Live Transcribe does not allow direct upload of existing audio files for transcription.
- **Workaround:** Similar to Google Recorder, you can play the audio near your device's microphone, and Live Transcribe will process it as though it were real-time speech.

For transcribing existing audio files, you may want to consider apps like **Otter.ai** or **Speechnotes**, which support uploading audio files for transcription directly.


#### You:
How do you import audio files to speech notes

#### ChatGPT:
As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, **Speechnotes** is primarily designed for real-time speech-to-text transcription using your device's microphone. Unfortunately, it does not support importing pre-recorded audio files like MP3s for transcription.

### **Alternative Options for Transcribing Audio Files:**

If you need to transcribe existing audio files on your Android device, consider using the following free apps that support this feature:

1. **Otter.ai**

   - **Import Audio Files:** Otter.ai allows you to upload and transcribe audio files directly from your device.
   - **How to Use:**
     1. **Download and Install:** Get the Otter.ai app from the Google Play Store.
     2. **Create an Account:** Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one.
     3. **Import Audio:**
        - Tap the **"+"** button at the bottom of the screen.
        - Select **"Import Audio."**
        - Choose the MP3 file you wish to transcribe from your device.
     4. **Start Transcription:** The app will process the file and provide a transcription.
   - **Free Plan Limitations:** The free plan offers up to 600 minutes of transcription per month.

2. **Transcribe - Speech to Text**

   - **Import Audio Files:** This app supports importing various audio formats, including MP3.
   - **How to Use:**
     1. **Install the App:** Download it from the Google Play Store.
     2. **Open and Import:**
        - Launch the app and tap on the **"Upload"** icon.
        - Select your audio file from the device's storage.
     3. **Choose Language and Transcribe:** Select the language of the audio and start the transcription process.
   - **Free Usage:** Offers a limited free trial with options for in-app purchases for additional features.

3. **Google Live Transcribe (Workaround)**

   - While **Live Transcribe** doesn't support importing files, you can use it to transcribe audio played through your device's speakers.
   - **How to Use:**
     1. **Play the Audio:** Use a media player app to play the MP3 file aloud.
     2. **Open Live Transcribe:** The app will capture the audio through the microphone and transcribe it in real-time.
   - **Note:** This method may not be as accurate due to potential background noise and audio quality loss.

### **Summary**

Since Speechnotes doesn't support importing audio files, using apps like **Otter.ai** or **Transcribe - Speech to Text** would be more effective for your needs. These apps are user-friendly and specifically designed to handle pre-recorded audio transcriptions.
