#### You:
So "families making" etc etc... I don't live at home, and no one helps me pay for anything right now. 

#### ChatGPT:
Great point—this is important! Harvard (and most colleges) distinguish between **dependent** and **independent** students when calculating financial aid:

---

## 🎯 **Your Situation (Independent Student):**

Because you mentioned you:

- **Do NOT** live with family.
- **Are NOT** financially supported by parents or family members.
- Fully support yourself financially.

**You should likely file as an "independent student"** on Harvard’s Net Price Calculator.

---

## ✅ **What This Means for You:**

As an **independent student**, Harvard calculates aid based **only on your own financial situation**. This typically means:

- **Lower expected family contribution (EFC)**, because no parental income/assets are considered.
- **Potentially more generous financial aid**.

Harvard is among a small number of schools with generous aid, especially for independent students with lower or modest incomes.

Your income of around **$40,104** and limited assets would typically put you in a strong position to qualify for substantial financial assistance.

---

## 📌 **What To Do Next in Harvard’s Calculator:**

- Clearly select that **you support yourself financially** (independent student status).
- Enter **ONLY your own income and assets** (the info we've compiled already).
- You typically **do NOT** need parental financial details since they don't support you financially, especially if you're above the age threshold (generally 24+) or can demonstrate complete financial independence.

---

## 🚨 **Important:**

- Carefully verify that the calculator recognizes your **independent student status**.
- Make sure it does **NOT** mistakenly ask for parental info.

---

## 💬 **Recommendation:**

You’re all set with your own details! Enter these in Harvard’s Net Price Calculator under **independent student**. This approach will give you the most accurate, favorable estimate for financial aid.

Looking more for a dateish

#### ChatGPT:
If you're filling out forms that ask for exact dates regarding your high school attendance, you'd generally enter:

For official documents (like college applications or background checks), using **09/01/2002 – 06/01/2006** is accurate and typically accepted.

✅ **Final Recommendation:**

- **Start:** **09/01/2002**
- **End:** **06/01/2006**

If you have your diploma or official records, confirm with those exact dates. Otherwise, these approximate dates will suffice for almost all official purposes.

#### You:
Is harvard in Fallout 4? I thought Cambridge was. 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes! Harvard appears in the Fallout universe, specifically in **Fallout 4** as part of the fictionalized post-apocalyptic city of Boston (known as the Commonwealth in the game).

### 📌 **Harvard in Fallout 4 (as "C.I.T."):**

In *Fallout 4*, Harvard University is depicted as the **Commonwealth Institute of Technology (C.I.T.)**—a direct nod to the real-life MIT, but geographically and thematically merging aspects of both MIT and Harvard into a single institution.

- **Location:** Situated in **Cambridge**, within the game's "Greater Boston" area, close to where Harvard and MIT are located in real life.
- **Relevance:** It serves as the original home of the **Institute**, a mysterious, high-tech faction responsible for synthetic humans (synths) and advanced technologies.

---

### 🎮 **Cambridge (Real-Life vs. Fallout 4):**

- In real life, Cambridge, Massachusetts, hosts both Harvard University and MIT.
- In *Fallout 4*, the city is called **Cambridge** and prominently features the **C.I.T. Ruins** (MIT-inspired), with aspects reminiscent of Harvard's scholarly reputation and architecture.

---

### 📝 **So, in short:**

- Harvard isn't explicitly named but is part of Fallout’s "Cambridge" theme.
- The **Commonwealth Institute of Technology (C.I.T.)** represents the real-life universities in Cambridge (MIT and Harvard combined).

If you're exploring references or trivia for Harvard's application or personal interest, mentioning this blend of Harvard and MIT into the C.I.T. could be an engaging detail.

#### You:
Interesting. So, admissions, I know you have advisors... I remember having one in 2009 when I was admitted to UofPOnlineArtsInstitute. Speaking of which, I thought that debt went away by executive order a few years ago? 

#### ChatGPT:
Regarding student loan debt forgiveness for colleges like the **University of Phoenix**, the situation can be a bit complex:

### 🎓 **Debt Forgiveness & Executive Orders:**

- President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan (2022–2023) initially targeted federal student loans, forgiving up to $10,000 (or $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients), but the Supreme Court blocked that specific program in June 2023.
- However, the administration introduced other relief measures, including an income-driven repayment (IDR) overhaul and loan forgiveness for borrowers defrauded by certain for-profit institutions.

### 📌 **Debt from For-Profit Schools (like University of Phoenix):**

- **Borrower's Defense to Repayment:**\
  If you believe your school misled you or engaged in deceptive practices (a common concern raised about some for-profit colleges), you could qualify for forgiveness through this program.
- **Closed School Discharge:**\
  If your campus shut down while enrolled or soon after leaving, loans could be fully discharged.

**Note:** As of now, there's **no blanket forgiveness specifically for all University of Phoenix attendees**, but the Biden administration has significantly expanded forgiveness specifically for borrowers defrauded by certain for-profit institutions.

### ⚠️ **Does Your University Qualify?**

- Harvard's admissions or financial aid process is separate and unaffected by prior student loan debts or forgiveness programs.
- Your previous loans and their forgiveness would typically be handled through the **Department of Education** or **Federal Student Aid**, not the college you're applying to next.

---

### 📝 **Action Steps (If Applicable):**

- Visit [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) and log in to check loan forgiveness eligibility.
- Explore **"Borrower Defense"** if you believe your former school (like a previous for-profit college) misled you.
- Check your Federal Student Aid account to confirm the status of any debts or forgiven amounts.

---

If you're concerned about previous loans impacting Harvard admissions or financial aid, don't worry:

- Harvard evaluates financial aid based on **current** financial circumstances—not past student debts.
