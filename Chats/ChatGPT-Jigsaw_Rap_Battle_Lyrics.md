# Jigsaw Rap Battle Lyrics

#### You:
I need a rap battle styled dubstep song written by Jigsaw, the famous Saw movie villain. Don't mention genres, song styles, song types, dubstep, bass, or anything similar.

Alright, here we go:

**Verse 1:**\
You woke up in chains, think it's just a game?\
I’m the architect of fear, and I’m here to stake my claim.\
Tick tock, time’s up, no place to run,\
You’ll be beggin’ for mercy ‘fore this round is done.

You think you’re clever, but I’m the one pullin’ strings,\
Every move you make, just feeds my twisted whims.\
Your choices brought you here, now it’s time to pay,\
I’m the judge, jury, and executioner—let’s play.

**Chorus:**\
Welcome to the nightmare, you can’t escape,\
The traps are set, feel the cold embrace.\
Face your fears, there’s no turnin’ back,\
In my twisted world, you're under attack.

**Verse 2:**\
You hear the gears grind, feel the tension in the air,\
You thought you had control, but I’m always there.\
Puzzle pieces scattered, you’re losing your mind,\
But the truth you seek, you’ll never find.

You thought you could cheat death, escape my grip,\
But every choice you made, just tightens the script.\
Now you’re trapped, a pawn in my game,\
And when this is over, you won’t be the same.

**Chorus:**\
Welcome to the nightmare, you can’t escape,\
The traps are set, feel the cold embrace.\
Face your fears, there’s no turnin’ back,\
In my twisted world, you're under attack.

**Bridge:**\
You think you’re brave, but fear’s a killer,\
In this chamber of pain, I’m the only thriller.\
No mercy, no hope, just the darkness within,\
This is your final test—can you win?

**Outro:**\
Time’s running out, hear the clock’s slow chime,\
In this deadly game, you’re outta time.\
One last chance to prove your worth,\
Or vanish forever beneath the earth.

Jigsaw would definitely drop the mic… or maybe a trap.Alright, here we go:
