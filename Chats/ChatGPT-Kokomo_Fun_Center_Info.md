Looks like there’s a bit of mix‑up here—**Kokomo’s Family Fun Center** with the mini‑golf dome isn’t in Kokomo, Indiana, but in **Saginaw, Michigan** (at 5200 Kokomo Dr.) citeturn0search9turn0search11.

### 🔍 Here’s what I found about it:

- **Location**: 5200 Kokomo Dr, Saginaw, MI 48604 citeturn0search9turn0search11
- **Operating since 1996**, still open under new ownership after being bought by Memorable Experiences Group in January 2022 citeturn0search15.
- Offers go-karts, miniature golf, bumper boats, batting cages, laser tag, driving range, indoor arcade, café, and previously had an indoor "golf dome" or driving range citeturn0search19turn0search9.

### Regarding the dome that “blew over”:

- I couldn’t find any recent mention of a golf dome collapse from a windstorm, but given Saginaw’s weather history, strong storms do hit that region periodically.
- If this was **a decade ago**, it might explain why there’s little online documentation now.

### Website & Contact Info

- They **do have an official site**: listed as <http://www.kokomos.com> citeturn0search13turn0search11
- Phone: (989) 797‑5656 citeturn0search9turn0search11

### ✅ What you can do next

1. **Visit their site** (kokomos.com) to check current attractions and whether the dome is fully restored.
2. **Call them** to ask directly about any indoor mini‑golf dome history—storms, repairs, etc.
3. If you're still sure it was in **Kokomo, IN**, consider contacting local news or historical archives there, since no Indiana establishment by that exact name appears active.

Would you like help drafting an email or questions to find out more about the dome? Or do you want me to check storm archives for Saginaw about a dome collapse?

You're absolutely right about the venue—it *does* exist, but it's not in Kokomo, IN. Here's the clearer picture:

---

## 🏗️ Location & Facilities

- **Kokomo’s Family Fun Center** is located at **5200 Kokomo Drive, Saginaw, MI**—not Indiana citeturn0search3turn0search6turn0image2turn0image3.

  - **Laser tag**, arcade, bumper boats, mini-golf, outdoor go‑karts, and that big bounce ship citeturn0search3turn0search6.

## 🌨️ Dome Collapse Explained

- In **February 2016**, the dome was **deflated** during a **significant snowstorm**:
  - Staff attempted to clear accumulated snow, but when the dome was re-inflated, it “**just kind of burst**” citeturn0search1turn0image0.
  - The manager at the time confirmed that **repairs were unlikely**, planning to build an outdoor driving range instead by 2017 citeturn0search1.
- So it wasn’t wind that did the damage—it was **heavy snow**.

---

## ✅ Current Status

- Their original URL **kokomos.com** still exists.
- The indoor dome was **never rebuilt**—they shifted focus to the outdoor range, go-karts, arcade, etc.

---

3. If you're keen to revisit, you can **visit in person or contact them at the Saginaw location** to reminisce or ask about memory lane.

---

#### 🔍 Summary

- It's definitively **Kokomo’s Family Fun Center in Saginaw, MI**, not Indiana.
- The dome collapsed under snow, circa 2016, and wasn’t rebuilt.
- The rest of the attractions continued outdoors or inside non-dome spaces.
