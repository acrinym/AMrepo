# Free Audio Recording Links

#### You:
Are there any free like audio recording platforms online that I could record just short messages that are longer than Facebook's 1 minute that I can send out using a link? One minute is a very short amount of time for what I want to convey. So it's like a notepad but for audio instead of text storage
