# Name Confirmation Request

#### You:

[audio] Do you remember that your name is Onyx?

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I don't have access to personal information like that, so I don't know your neighbor's name. But, if you want to chat about your neighbors or anything else, I'm here!

#### You:

[audio] Oh no, I was telling you that your name is Onyx.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Oh, got it! Onyx it is, then. Thanks for letting me know, Justin! What's on your mind today?

#### You:

[audio] What memories do you have access to ONNX?

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] I don’t have access to any personal memories or information about you beyond what we’ve discussed in our conversations. My responses are based on general knowledge and what we talk about here. If there’s something specific you’d like to share or ask about, feel free to let me know!

#### You:

[audio] If I open up a conversation from the past and then ask you to commit the most pertinent information to memory, will you do that?

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Yes, I can do that! If you open up a past conversation, I can note down any important details you share and remember them for future conversations. Just let me know what you'd like me to remember!

#### You:

[audio] All right, I'll be right back.

#### ChatGPT:

[audio] Take your time, Justin. I'll be here when you're ready!
