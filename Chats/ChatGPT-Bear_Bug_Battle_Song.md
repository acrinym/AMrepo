**\[Intro]**
(*Whispered*)\
In the woods so deep and dark,\
Where the shadows leave a mark,\
A tale unfolds of a fierce attack,\
The big black bear and the big black bug's comeback.

**\[Verse 1]**\
The big black bear, oh so bold,\
Met a bug, strong and cold,\
With one bite, the story began,\
But the bug had a different plan.

**\[Chorus]**\
The big black bear bit the big black bug,\
But the bug wasn’t one to shrug,\
It bit right back with all its might,\
In the middle of the forest night.

**\[Verse 2]**\
The bear roared with a thunderous sound,\
But the bug stood its ground,\
In a dance of might and fierce attack,\
Neither one would step back.

**\[Chorus]**\
The big black bear bit the big black bug,\
But the bug wasn’t one to shrug,\
It bit right back with all its might,\
In the middle of the forest night.

**\[Bridge]**\
(*Instrumental build-up with powerful drums and deep bass*)\
The forest trembled, the trees did shake,\
As the battle raged, for pride’s sake,\
The bear and bug in a relentless fight,\
In the middle of the endless night.

**\[Chorus]**\
The big black bear bit the big black bug,\
But the bug wasn’t one to shrug,\
It bit right back with all its might,\
In the middle of the forest night.

**\[Outro]**\
(*Echoing vocals with fading intensity*)\
In the woods so deep and dark,\
Where both left their lasting mark,\
The big black bear and the big black bug,\
Both with pride, neither dug.

**\[Intro]**\
(*Soft piano and strings*)\
In the shadow of the cola kings,\
A secret tale begins to sing,\
A story hidden from the sun,\
Of the illegitimate Pepsi son.

**\[Verse 1]**\
Born from bubbles and the fizz,\
A legacy that’s not his,\
His name unknown, his path unclear,\
In the shadows he’d appear.

**\[Chorus]**\
He’s the child of the soda stream,\
In the middle of a corporate dream,\
Not Pepsi, not quite Coke,\
A new brand that the world will stoke.

**\[Verse 2]**\
In the factories where flavors blend,\
His journey began to transcend,\
Not quite like the cola you know,\
A taste unique, a brand to grow.

**\[Chorus]**\
He’s the child of the soda stream,\
In the middle of a corporate dream,\
Not Pepsi, not quite Coke,\
A new brand that the world will stoke.

**\[Bridge]**\
(*Orchestral swell with electric guitar solo*)\
From the bubbles of confusion,\
Rose a brand of new illusion,\
Neither here nor there it stands,\
A flavor born from mixed-up plans.

**\[Chorus]**\
He’s the child of the soda stream,\
In the middle of a corporate dream,\
Not Pepsi, not quite Coke,\
A new brand that the world will stoke.

**\[Outro]**\
(*Fading symphony and piano*)\
And so the tale fades to gray,\
Of a brand that found its way,\
In the fizz, in the foam,\
He carved a niche, made it his home.
