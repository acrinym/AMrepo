#### ChatGPT:
In the case of a winter disaster and power grid shutdown, it’s important to have a prepared route that avoids major roads and highways while being as safe as possible. Here’s a suggested route you can consider, though I recommend scouting it ahead of time to ensure it meets your needs and is free of unexpected obstacles.

### General Guidelines for Avoiding Major Roads:

- Use smaller residential roads, back roads, and rural routes.
- Avoid heavily trafficked roads like US-131, M-6, and I-96.
- Be aware of weather conditions and any potential road closures or hazards.

### Suggested Escape Route from Kentwood to Nunica (Approx. 30 miles):

1. **Start from Kentwood:**
   - Begin by leaving Kentwood using **60th Street SE** or another nearby smaller road that connects you to rural areas.

2. **Head West Using Local Roads:**
   - Travel west on **60th Street SE** until you reach **Burlingame Avenue SW**.
   - Take **Burlingame Avenue SW** north. This will help you bypass larger roads like **US-131**.

3. **Connect to Rural Routes:**
   - Turn left (west) onto **44th Street SW**, a quieter road with less traffic. Continue until you reach **Kenowa Avenue SW**.
   - Head north on **Kenowa Avenue SW**. This road runs along the border of Kent and Ottawa counties, keeping you away from major traffic.

4. **Avoiding M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive):**
   - As you travel north, cross under **M-45**, avoiding it since it's a major road.
   - Continue north on **Kenowa Avenue SW** until you reach **Fillmore Street**.

5. **Travel West on Fillmore Street:**
   - Turn left (west) onto **Fillmore Street** and continue for several miles.
   - This road will take you through rural areas, keeping you away from highways like **I-96**.

6. **Heading North Toward Nunica:**
   - As you near Nunica, consider taking a series of local roads such as **68th Avenue** or **96th Avenue** (northbound) to bring you into the Nunica area.
   - From here, you can navigate into town using backroads to avoid traffic or any blockages.

### Key Tips for the Route:

- Make sure to have a physical map on hand, as GPS might not be reliable in a power outage.
- Prepare for alternative routes in case smaller roads are impassable due to snow or downed trees.
- Keep emergency supplies, including winter gear, food, water, and a first aid kit, in your vehicle.
- Scout the route before a disaster to familiarize yourself with turns, landmarks, and potential challenges.

#### You:
44th is populated though

#### ChatGPT:
You're right that 44th Street SW is fairly populated. Let's refine the route to focus on even more rural, less-traveled roads. Here's a new version of the route that avoids 44th and continues to use more secluded backroads:

### Revised Escape Route from Kentwood to Nunica:

1. **Start from Kentwood:**
   - Begin by leaving Kentwood using **60th Street SE** or another nearby quiet road.
   - Instead of heading west immediately, travel south on **Eastern Avenue** or a similar residential road until you reach **84th Street SE**.

2. **Head West Using Rural Roads:**
   - Take **84th Street SE** west. This is a more rural route with far fewer houses and traffic.
   - Continue on **84th Street SE** past **US-131** and **M-6**. You'll travel through agricultural areas with minimal traffic.

3. **Turn North at Kenowa Avenue SW:**
   - When you reach **Kenowa Avenue SW**, turn north (right). This keeps you in a rural area, away from larger, busier streets.
   - Follow **Kenowa Avenue** north. You’ll bypass larger intersections and remain on more rural terrain.

4. **West on Tyler Street:**
   - As you continue north on **Kenowa Avenue**, after passing under **M-45** (Lake Michigan Drive), turn left (west) onto **Tyler Street**.
   - This is a quieter road that cuts through rural land and avoids most of the residential population.

5. **Head North Using 68th Avenue:**
   - When you reach **68th Avenue** (a rural road), turn north and continue heading toward Nunica. You'll stay in the countryside while making your way into the Nunica area.

6. **Final Stretch:**
   - From **68th Avenue**, you'll reach the Nunica area by continuing north. You can enter Nunica using a series of smaller roads like **Leonard Street** or **Cleveland Street** to avoid traffic and congestion.

### Additional Tips:

- **Alternative Roads**: If at any point the roads seem impassable or congested, you can consider nearby backroads like **72nd Avenue** or **84th Avenue** to navigate more freely.
- **Scouting**: It's a good idea to scout these roads in advance to ensure they remain rural and are suitable for winter travel.
- **Winter Preparedness**: Make sure to have an emergency kit with blankets, extra clothing, food, and supplies in case the journey takes longer than expected due to weather conditions.

This route should keep you well away from more populated or urban roads and give you a clearer path to Nunica. Let me know if you'd like further refinement or alternate suggestions for specific sections of the trip!
