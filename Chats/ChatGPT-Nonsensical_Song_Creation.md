It should be not really understandable by the average human but by somebody who's constantly playing fortnite for the last 4 years, and a 13 year old in Middle School would easily identify what it's saying

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, here’s a song packed with Gen Z slang, gaming lingo, and TikTok-isms that a 13-year-old Fortnite player might throw around casually. It’s a mix of flexing, gaming trash-talk, and those quirky phrases that only the plugged-in crowd will understand.

#### You:
What's that hotel type music or elevator type music that's just like synthwave

#### ChatGPT:
That type of music is often referred to as **"vaporwave"** or sometimes **"mallsoft."** Vaporwave is a genre that takes influence from 80s and 90s elevator music, smooth jazz, lounge music, and corporate background music, blending it with synth-heavy, dreamy, and often nostalgic elements.

**Mallsoft** is a subgenre within vaporwave that’s specifically crafted to sound like background music in malls, lobbies, or waiting areas, with a slightly echoey or reverberating effect that makes it feel distant and immersive. Both genres use slowed-down tempos, retro synths, and sampled audio from commercials, video games, or old corporate training videos to evoke a surreal, nostalgic vibe, reminiscent of being in a retro shopping mall or elevator.

If you’re looking for artists or examples:

- **Macintosh Plus** and the track *リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー* is iconic in vaporwave.
- **Saint Pepsi**, **Luxury Elite**, and **Cat System Corp.** are popular for vaporwave and mallsoft with that chill, background feel.
- **HOME** and **Yung Bae** lean towards synthwave but include vaporwave elements that add to that lo-fi, nostalgic sound you’d hear in the background of a virtual hotel lobby or lounge.


#### You:
Seiko lumbrite, what's it made with

#### ChatGPT:
Seiko’s **LumiBrite** is a luminescent material used on the dials and hands of many of their watches to provide glow in low-light conditions. Unlike older luminous paints that relied on radioactive substances (like radium or tritium), LumiBrite is **completely non-radioactive** and instead works by charging with ambient light.

### Composition and Technology

LumiBrite is primarily made from **strontium aluminate**—a non-radioactive, phosphorescent material that is much brighter and longer-lasting than traditional zinc sulfide-based luminous compounds. When exposed to natural or artificial light, the strontium aluminate absorbs and stores the energy, which it then releases slowly as visible light in the dark.

### Key Characteristics

- **Brightness**: LumiBrite is much brighter initially compared to older luminescent materials.
- **Longevity**: It can glow for hours, depending on how much light exposure it received beforehand.
- **Safety**: Since it’s non-radioactive, LumiBrite is safe for long-term use and doesn’t require special handling like radioactive materials.

LumiBrite represents an evolution in luminescent technology, offering Seiko watches a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly glow feature.


#### You:
Can you buy lumi bright aside from watches

#### ChatGPT:
No, Seiko LumiBrite is not available for purchase as a standalone product. Seiko developed LumiBrite specifically for use in their watches, and they have not made it available for sale separately. This proprietary material is manufactured specifically for Seiko's needs, so the only way to experience LumiBrite is through a Seiko watch or a watch made by one of their subsidiaries.

If you’re looking for similar luminous materials that can be purchased, **strontium aluminate-based pigments** (the main component in LumiBrite) are available from various third-party suppliers and are used in crafts, paints, and even custom watch dials. Brands like **Super-LumiNova** offer non-radioactive, strontium aluminate-based pigments similar in performance to LumiBrite and are available for other applications or custom projects.


#### You:
Can you buy strontium illuminate

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, **strontium aluminate** is available for purchase and can be found through various suppliers, especially those specializing in glow-in-the-dark or luminescent pigments. It’s widely used in crafting, DIY projects, and even in custom watch modifications due to its bright and long-lasting glow properties.

### Where to Find Strontium Aluminate

- **Online retailers** like Amazon, Etsy, or specialty crafting sites often sell strontium aluminate in powdered form for use in paints, resins, or other custom projects.
- **Industrial suppliers** such as Sigma-Aldrich or Alibaba offer strontium aluminate powders, usually in bulk, which can be more cost-effective for larger projects.

### Things to Note

- **Quality Variations**: Strontium aluminate pigments come in different grades and colors (like green, blue, and aqua), so it’s good to check the specifications, especially glow duration and brightness.
- **Application Methods**: It can be mixed into clear paint, resin, or lacquer to create a glowing finish on various surfaces, from crafts to DIY watch dials.

Strontium aluminate is a versatile choice for projects requiring high-performance, glow-in-the-dark effects, similar to Seiko’s LumiBrite.
