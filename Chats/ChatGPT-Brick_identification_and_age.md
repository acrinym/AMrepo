I found these bricks under a bridge, what kind are they and how old are they

#### ChatGPT:
The objects in the photo look like **decorative concrete or stone blocks**, possibly from:

- **A garden edging or border** (often used for flower beds or walkways).
- **An architectural trim** (could have been part of a wall, decorative fence, or small structure).

### Why they look this way:

- The scalloped edge (curved, repeating semi-circles) is typical of garden edging blocks used from the **mid-20th century to present**.
- Their weathered and chipped condition suggests they’ve been exposed for many years, possibly decades, but these styles are **still sold today** in similar forms.

### Likely age:

- **Not antique**—these are likely **post-1950s** garden edging bricks.
- If found under a bridge, they might have been discarded construction or landscaping debris, potentially decades old but not ancient.

Would you like me to **look up historical designs for comparison** to see if there’s any chance they’re older (like early 20th century concrete edging)? Or should I **show modern equivalents** so you can see how similar they are today?The objects in the photo look like **decorative concrete or stone blocks**, possibly from:
