# Next steps for RitualOS

#### You:
https://github.com/acrinym/RitualOS/

Now, what are the next things we need to do here? Not all buttons are working, not all functions RitualFS is not working, the storage element(to store files in databases and make the project portable) - are not enabled. 

Next steps: Finish building out things that are not built out currently.

To figure out “what’s next” I dug through the repository’s available documentation.  The `README.md` gives a high‑level overview of the intended system and a roadmap for unfinished work.  Phase 1 has been checked off (documentation for GrimoireFS, Media Storage and SymbolWiki exist), while Phase 2 and Phase 3 remain untouched【432616869218678†L204-L225】.  The docs for GrimoireFS and Media Storage describe APIs and data models, but there is no implementation code in the repo yet【423782289382296†L31-L90】【528004668949163†L72-L100】.  In other words, most of the project is still conceptual.  That explains why buttons don’t work and why “RitualFS” (the encrypted storage layer) isn’t enabled.

### High‑level gaps

- **No application code**: There are only Markdown files; there are no `.cs` files implementing the services or the UI.  All the APIs in the docs (e.g., `GrimoireFS.CreateEntryAsync`, `MediaStorageService.StoreMediaAsync`, etc.) are aspirational【423782289382296†L31-L90】【528004668949163†L72-L100】.
- **Unimplemented features**: The roadmap lists many planned capabilities—ritual scheduler, audio ritual deck, AI dream journal, sigil generator, focus mode, ONNX sigil synthesizer, stereogram generator, astrological integration and energy‑work tools—and none of these exist yet【432616869218678†L213-L225】.
- **Storage/export**: Although GrimoireFS and Media Storage describe local encrypted storage and backup/restore, there is no actual database or file‑format implementation.  Without these, the application cannot port data between devices【423782289382296†L162-L169】【528004668949163†L180-L191】.
- **UI wiring**: Even basic functions such as button clicks aren’t wired up because there is no XAML/UI layer in the repository.

### Suggested next steps

To “finish building out things that are not built out currently,” it’s helpful to break the work into achievable tasks:

1. **Implement core services (RitualFS / GrimoireFS)**
   - Create a `GrimoireFS` class that matches the documented API: initialization, create/get/update/delete entries, search methods, tag/symbol/date filtering and backup/restore【423782289382296†L31-L105】.  Use AES‑256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation【423782289382296†L151-L155】.
   - Decide on a storage format.  The docs mention offline‑first JSON files with metadata and an index【423782289382296†L162-L169】.  You could keep each entry in an encrypted `.enc` file and store metadata in an unencrypted `metadata.json`.  For portability, wrap the `grimoire/` folder into an import/export zip.
   - Add a data‑access layer over a lightweight embedded database (e.g. SQLite) to keep entries, media metadata and symbols in a portable file.  The DB can live alongside the existing file‑based storage and provide efficient queries.

2. **Implement media storage**
   - Build a `MediaStorageService` class with methods to store, retrieve, update and delete media files【528004668949163†L72-L100】.  Handle compression, thumbnail creation and encryption.  Maintain a `media_metadata.json` and `media_index.json` as described【528004668949163†L180-L191】.
   - Include batch import/export and a backup/restore mechanism for portability【528004668949163†L193-L204】.

3. **Implement SymbolWiki**
   - Create a `SymbolWikiService` with search, add, update and delete functions, and import/export of JSON symbol sets【175321401510038†L59-L77】.  The docs show the data structure (name, category, power level, SVG data, etc.)【175321401510038†L81-L110】.

4. **Build the UI layer**
   - Design a UI (WPF or Avalonia for cross‑platform) with tabs for rituals, media, symbols, codex, inventory and clients, matching the user‑guide descriptions【789438405014016†L36-L69】.
   - For each button or menu item, create commands that call the appropriate service methods and display status/error messages (the docs emphasise user feedback and accessibility).
   - Add a universal document viewer capable of reading PDFs, DOCX, EPUB, images and code.  Use existing .NET libraries (e.g., PdfSharp, LibGit2Sharp, etc.) and surface errors gracefully【789438405014016†L49-L53】.
   - Implement a theme picker and keyboard shortcuts, ensuring screen‑reader labels and high‑contrast options.

5. **Finish the roadmap features**
   - **Ritual Scheduler**: Use lunar and planetary data to suggest optimal ritual timing.  This could pull from public astronomy APIs.
   - **Audio Ritual Deck**: Provide a customizable soundboard for chants and meditation tracks; integrate with Media Storage.
   - **Dream Journal AI**: Use NLP or basic ML to recognise symbols/archetypes in dream descriptions.  Start simple—e.g., keyword extraction tied to SymbolWiki—and leave ONNX models for later.
   - **Sigil Generator and ONNX Sigil Synthesizer**: Offer both a manual sigil‑drawing canvas and an AI‑generated option.  The ONNX component can be an optional plugin.
   - **Focus Mode**: Create a distraction‑free UI with larger fonts and minimal controls, optionally playing ambient sound.
   - **Astrological Integration** & **Energy Work Tools**: Provide widgets for current planetary aspects and simple aura/energy‑tracking journal entries.
   - **Depth map & stereogram generators**: These could be optional art plugins for ritual visuals.

6. **Testing and docs**
   - Write unit tests for each service API, including encryption/decryption, index search, and backup/restore.
   - Add integration tests for the UI (e.g., using automated UI testing frameworks).
   - Keep the documentation in sync with the code, and add troubleshooting notes where necessary【789438405014016†L120-L124】.

In short, RitualOS currently consists of design documents and a roadmap.  To make it usable, you’ll need to implement the core services (encrypted data storage, media storage, and symbol wiki), build the UI and wire it to those services, add the advanced roadmap features, and create a portable storage/backup system.  Once those foundations are in place, you can layer on more mystical enhancements—moon‑phase scheduling, AI dream analysis, sigil synthesis and energy tools—to align with your magical practice.
