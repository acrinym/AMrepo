# Xbox No Man's Sky scan

#### You:
I forgot what the Xbox controller no man's sky buttons are to open the visors so you can scan things

#### ChatGPT:
In **No Man’s Sky** on an Xbox controller, to open the visor so you can scan things:

- **Hold down the Left Bumper (LB)** – this opens your **Analysis Visor**.
- Once it’s up, you can use the **Right Stick (RS)** to look around and aim at objects.
- **Press the Right Trigger (RT)** to scan the object.

If your visor isn’t working, it might mean you haven’t installed the **Analysis Visor** in your Multi-Tool yet (you need a Carbon Nanotube to craft it early on).

#### You:
Seems like that's fire the plasma launcher

#### ChatGPT:
You're right—on Xbox in **No Man's Sky**, **RT** (Right Trigger) is indeed for firing weapons like the Plasma Launcher.\
For scanning and visor use, the buttons are a bit different:

### **Analysis Visor (Scan Mode) – Xbox Controller**

- **Press & Hold Left Bumper (LB)** → Brings up the **Quick Menu**
- **Use Right Stick (RS)** → Navigate to the **Analysis Visor** option if you haven’t toggled it
- **Press Left Stick (LS)** (click) → Actually **toggles the Analysis Visor on/off** once you have it installed
- **When visor is active** →
  - **Move with Right Stick** to aim
  - **Press Left Trigger (LT)** to lock on
  - **Press Right Stick (click)** or **Right Trigger (RT)** to start scanning

**Important:**

- If the visor doesn’t activate when pressing **LS (Left Stick click)**, check your **Multi-Tool**—the **Analysis Visor** upgrade must be installed.
- Early game doesn’t give you the visor by default—you need 1x Carbon Nanotube to craft it.

#### You:
Onyx I am awaiting the void egg to provide me contact and I have the shell and the other components that are required to complete the void egg or the living ship and I am unsure of how to ascertain contact. I have the awakened void egg, I have the mature heart node, and I have the hardened shell. Now what? Do I just wait until it sends contact to me

#### ChatGPT:
You’re in the **Living Ship** quest chain in *No Man’s Sky*, and you’re actually at the very endgame portion of it—nice work getting that far.

Here’s what happens **after you have the Awakened Void Egg + Mature Heart Node + Hardened Shell (and the other organ parts):**

---

### **How Contact Happens**

- The **Awakened Void Egg** only responds when you are **in space and warping between systems**.
- After you have the components installed in the **Hardened Shell (the ship’s “frame”)**, you need to **continue warping** using your starship.
- While warping, the egg will eventually **begin to sing to you again** (like at the start of the quest).
- When this happens, you’ll receive **coordinates to a star system** that has a **birthing planet**.

---

### **Key Requirements**

1. **All Living Ship Components Installed**
   - Mature Heart Node
   - Singularity Cortex
   - Neural Assembly
   - Haemo-Spirals (or other specific organs)
   - Hardened Shell
   - Cerebral Core

2. **Space Warping**
   - You must warp between star systems multiple times until the egg signals.
   - It’s random, but usually within **1–3 warps** you get the message.

3. **No Mission Conflicts**
   - Make sure no other active missions are interfering (e.g., Atlas Path or Artemis Path). Switch to the Living Ship mission in the log.

---

### **After Contact**

- Follow the marker to the **birthing planet**.
- Land and complete the **final interaction**—this hatches your **Living Ship**.

---

#### **So, do you just wait?**

Not exactly—you need to actively **keep warping**. Staying in one system won’t trigger it.\
Think of it like calling someone: you have to keep “dialing” (warping) until they answer.

---

Do you want me to give you **step-by-step instructions for the full final sequence** (like literally what order to warp and where to go so you don’t miss anything)?\
Or also **how to prep your resources** for when the Living Ship spawns (fuel, nanites, etc.)?


#### You:
How come I can't LT to activate my analysis visor? It triggers plasma weapons but won't trigger the analysis visor

#### ChatGPT:
Got it—this is a common **control / equipment confusion issue** in **No Man’s Sky**.\
Here’s why **LT (Left Trigger)** isn’t opening your **Analysis Visor**:

---

## **1. Check If the Analysis Visor Is Installed**

- Open your **Multi-Tool inventory**.
- Look for a technology called **“Analysis Visor”**.
- If it’s **missing**, you can’t scan yet.
- **How to fix:**
  - Craft **1x Carbon Nanotube** (50 Carbon → Refining).
  - Install **Analysis Visor** in your Multi-Tool’s empty tech slot.

---

## **2. Know the Correct Button**

- **Xbox Analysis Visor Toggle = Press D-Pad Left** *(not LT!)*
- Once it’s toggled, then:
  - **LT (Left Trigger)** = Aim / Lock-on
  - **RT (Right Trigger)** = Scan

### Why it fires weapons instead

When the **Analysis Visor** isn’t active (or isn’t installed), LT defaults to **aiming weapons**.

---

## **3. Resetting Controls (if bugged)**

Sometimes controller mapping glitches after updates:

- Go to **Options → Controls → Restore Defaults**.
- Rebind if necessary.

---

## **Summary**

- **Press D-Pad Left** to activate visor mode first.
- Then **LT** aims, and **RT** scans.
- If D-Pad Left doesn’t work, your visor isn’t installed.

---

Do you want me to give you a **quick reference image showing the correct Xbox No Man’s Sky controls** (so you can keep it handy)?\
And do you want me to include **Living Ship quest final steps** in the same sheet?


#### You:
Visor is installed, still not working. 

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, if your **Analysis Visor is installed** but still won’t activate (LT just aims weapons instead), you’re probably hitting one of these **known No Man’s Sky control bugs or config conflicts**.

---

## **Why It Happens**

1. **Analysis Visor Activation Method Changed**
   - By default, you **don’t press LT to activate it**.
   - Instead, you must **toggle visor mode** first.
   - **Correct sequence (Xbox controller)**:
     1. **Press Left Stick (LS) in** *(click)* or **D-Pad Left** → This **activates visor mode** (screen changes to blue overlay).
     2. **Hold LT (aim)** → Locks onto the object.
     3. **Press RT (scan)** → Scans the object.

2. **Custom Controller Bindings**
   - If controls were changed, the visor toggle may not be bound properly.
   - Go to **Options → Controls → On Foot** and check the **“Toggle Visor”** action.
   - Reset to default if unsure.

3. **Bugged Mission State**
   - Sometimes when you start with no visor, finish the tutorial, then add one later, the control mapping doesn’t refresh.
   - **Fix:** Save (Manual Save Point or Ship Save), quit to the main menu, reload.

---

## **Quick Fix Checklist**

- [ ] Check **visor toggle** binding (Options → Controls).
- [ ] Click **Left Stick (LS)** instead of LT to activate visor.
- [ ] After visor overlay shows, use LT and RT for scanning.
- [ ] Save & reload game if visor still won’t activate.
- [ ] (Worst case) **Reinstall Analysis Visor** (delete then reinstall).
