#### You:
Does anything come to my previous address once I change my address with the post office?

#### ChatGPT:
When you change your address with the post office, your mail will be forwarded to your new address for a certain period. However, it's important to notify important contacts and institutions directly about your address change to ensure that they update their records accordingly. Some mail, especially from sources that may not use the postal service's forwarding service, might still be sent to your old address.

It's a good practice to inform relevant parties of your address change to minimize any issues with mail delivery.
