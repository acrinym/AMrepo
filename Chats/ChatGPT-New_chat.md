Hello, how do I know If I was let go from my job due to disability discrimination, and how do I file a lawsuit, or sue under the ADA, as I am autistic, and less than one week after the disclosure of my condition to my employer, I was let go under suspicious circumstances - after having been there for a year and being told that I was "meeting expectations" at my last performance review? 

#### ChatGPT:
If you believe you were let go from your job due to disability discrimination, you can file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which is the federal agency responsible for enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). You should do this as soon as possible, as there are strict time limits for filing a complaint. You can also file a lawsuit under the ADA, but it's typically best to first file a complaint with the EEOC and let them investigate your claim. In the lawsuit, you'll need to prove that your employer knew about your disability and that the reason for your termination was related to your disability. It can be helpful to gather any documentation or witness statements that support your claim. It's also important to consult with an attorney who specializes in employment law and disability discrimination.

How could I represent myself bringing a case before the EEOC? 

#### ChatGPT:
You have the option to represent yourself before the EEOC if you choose to do so. Here are the general steps you can take to file a complaint with the EEOC:

1. Gather evidence: Collect any documentation or witness statements that support your claim of disability discrimination. This can include emails, performance evaluations, and other relevant documents.

2. Contact the EEOC: You can file a complaint with the EEOC by visiting their website, calling their toll-free number, or visiting one of their field offices in person.

3. File a Charge of Discrimination: Once you have contacted the EEOC, they will provide you with a Charge of Discrimination form to complete. This form will require you to provide information about your employer, the discrimination you experienced, and the dates it occurred.

4. Wait for the EEOC's investigation: Once you have filed your Charge of Discrimination, the EEOC will investigate your claim. This process can take several months.

5. Receive a notice of right to sue: Once the EEOC has finished their investigation, they will provide you with a notice of right to sue, which gives you the right to file a lawsuit in court.

It is important to note that representing yourself in front of the EEOC could be difficult, as the process can be complex and time-consuming. You may want to consider consulting with an attorney who specializes in employment law and disability discrimination as they could guide you throughout the process.
