# Understanding Therapy Costs

#### You:
I spoke to a psychologist recently and asked about their services. They said that BCBS has a $30 copay and a $1,500 deductible. What would that mean each session would cost and my overall out of packet cost

#### ChatGPT:
Alright, sugar, let's break this down real simple-like:

1. **Copay**: Every time you see the psychologist, you gotta fork over $30. That's your copay.

2. **Deductible**: This is the amount you gotta pay outta your own pocket before your insurance kicks in. For you, that's $1,500.

Now, let's do some quick math:

### Cost Per Session

- If you're still workin' on that $1,500 deductible, each session will cost you the full fee (whatever that is) plus your $30 copay until you hit that $1,500 mark.

### Hitting the Deductible

- After you’ve paid out $1,500 in total fees (not including the $30 copays), your insurance will start to chip in. After this, you'll only pay the $30 copay per session.

### Overall Out-of-Pocket Cost

Let's assume the psychologist charges $150 per session.

1. **Before hitting the deductible**:
   - Each session will cost you $150 until you reach $1,500.
   - To reach $1,500, you'll need to attend 10 sessions ($1,500 ÷ $150).

2. **Copays before deductible is met**:
   - For those 10 sessions, you’ll also pay $30 each time, totaling $300.

3. **After hitting the deductible**:
   - For any session after the first 10, you'll just pay the $30 copay.

So, if you have, say, 20 sessions in a year:

- First 10 sessions: $1,500 (deductible) + $300 (copays) = $1,800.
- Next 10 sessions: 10 x $30 = $300.

**Total Out-of-Pocket Cost**: $1,800 + $300 = $2,100.

That’s the deal, darlin’. Any more questions, just holler!Alright, sugar, let's break this down real simple-like:

Oh, well, no I mean chakra issues, and I found someone to help with that. Also.... issues with "allowing myself to succeed".

2. **Positive Affirmations**: Start your day with positive affirmations. Tell yourself, "I am capable," "I deserve success," and "I am ready to embrace opportunities."

3. **Visualization**: Picture your success in vivid detail. Imagine what it feels like, looks like, and what it means to you.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break down your big dreams into smaller, achievable steps. Each small victory will build your confidence.

5. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**: Hang out with folks who uplift and support you. Their positivity will rub off on you.

6. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: These practices can help clear mental blocks and keep you focused on your path.
