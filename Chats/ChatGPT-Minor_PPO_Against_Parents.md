What happens if a minor serves a ppo to their parents

#### ChatGPT:
When a **minor serves a Personal Protection Order (PPO) to their parents**, things can get legally and emotionally complicated. Here's what typically happens—and what needs to happen—for it to be valid and enforced:

---

### 🧷 Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **A PPO Must Be Issued by a Judge**

A minor can *request* a PPO against a parent (usually for reasons like abuse, harassment, or threats), **but it must be filed through the court**, and a **judge has to approve it**. The judge will consider:

- The severity of the threat
- The relationship between the parties
- Whether alternative measures (like CPS or family court interventions) would be more appropriate

So if a minor just *writes* or *hands* something to a parent and says, “Here’s a PPO”—it’s not valid unless it comes from the court.

#### 2. **Court Issues the PPO and Orders Service**

If a judge grants the PPO:

- The parent must be **formally served**—which means receiving the order in a legally recognized way (by a sheriff, process server, or a disinterested adult—not the minor).
- The order takes effect once they’ve been served.

> 🔥 **Key Fact:** A minor usually cannot serve the PPO themselves. It must be served by someone allowed by law.

#### 3. **Parent Must Comply or Risk Arrest**

Once served, the parent is **legally bound** by the terms of the PPO. If they violate it (contact, come near, threaten, etc.), they could be:

- Arrested
- Held in contempt
- Charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the violation and jurisdiction

---

### 🧠 Big Picture Considerations:

#### ❗Family Dynamics & Child Welfare

If a minor needs protection from their parents, it’s a **red flag for deeper issues**. Courts often loop in:

- **Child Protective Services (CPS)**
- **Family court**
- **Custody evaluations**

#### 🧠 Can a Minor Live Alone After a PPO?

If the minor is still underage, and the parent is removed or restricted, the court may:

- Appoint a **guardian**
- Place the child with **relatives or foster care**
- In some cases, allow **emancipation**, but that’s rare and must go through another legal process

---

### 🚨 TL;DR:

- A minor **can** request a PPO against a parent, but it must go through the **court**.
- The minor **cannot serve the PPO themselves**—it has to be served legally.
- If validly served, the parent **must comply**, or face legal consequences.
- The situation usually triggers **CPS involvement or alternative custody arrangements**.

#### You:
What if you are one of the relatives how does the child support or the relatives of the kid goes to stay with 

#### ChatGPT:
If you’re a **relative of the minor who filed a PPO against their parent**, and the court removes the parent from the picture (either temporarily or permanently), here’s how things generally play out for **you** and the **child**—including the *child support* angle:

---

### 👪 If You're the Relative the Child Goes to Stay With:

#### 🏠 1. **Temporary Placement or Guardianship**

- If the child is not safe at home, the court (often through CPS or family court) may place them with a **trusted relative**—you.
- This can be **informal** (short-term, emergency) or **formal** (through court-ordered guardianship or custody).
- Formal guardianship gives you **legal rights** to make decisions about their education, health, and more.

#### 📄 2. **Child Support May Shift to You**

If you take over primary care of the child:

- The **parent who was removed** may still be legally obligated to **pay child support**.
- You or the state (if you apply for aid) can file for **child support enforcement**.
- Support payments could go directly to **you**, to help offset food, clothing, school costs, etc.

> 💡 **You must have legal custody or guardianship** in most cases to receive child support. Just "having the kid over" temporarily doesn’t entitle you to it automatically.

#### ⚖️ 3. **Court Involvement Is Key**

To get any kind of **official recognition**, including:

- Custody
- Guardianship
- Child support
- Public benefits (like food assistance or Medicaid)

…you need the **court to grant you that status**. Often, family court will hold a hearing to sort out what’s best for the child.

---

### 🍼 So What Can *You* Do as the Relative?

#### ✅ If You Want to Step In and Help:

1. **Talk to CPS or the court** if they’re involved, and let them know you're willing.
2. **File for temporary guardianship or custody** if needed.
3. **Keep records** of expenses if you're caring for the child—this helps with child support or aid applications.
4. **Request child support** through the state or family court once you're legally responsible.

#### 🚩 If You’re Just Being Asked to “Watch the Kid” Without Court Orders:

That’s risky. Without legal backing:

- You may have trouble enrolling them in school or getting medical treatment.
- You likely can’t access child support or government help.

---

### 🧾 Real Talk on Child Support:

- **It follows the child**—not the parent.
- If the child is with you and you’re the legal guardian, **you can be the recipient**.
- The parent who’s no longer providing care can still be ordered to **pay support**, regardless of the PPO.

---

### ✊ Bottom Line:

If you’re stepping up to care for a child displaced by a PPO:

- **Get legal guardianship or custody** ASAP
- **Document everything**
- **You have the right to seek support**, and the court will often back you if it's in the child’s best interest

How do the papers get served

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, **serving court papers**—the unglamorous but *absolutely vital* step that makes legal actions official. If you’re helping a minor serve a PPO (or any court order), here’s how it actually works, step-by-step:

---

### 📜 What Is “Serving Papers”?

It means **legally delivering** court documents (like a PPO) to the other party—so they know what’s going on and have a chance to respond. It’s a **due process** thing, not optional, and the court won’t enforce a PPO until it’s properly served.

---

### 🛎️ Who Can Serve PPO Papers?

✅ **Allowed:**

- **Sheriff’s department** (usually free for PPOs)
- **Private process server** (licensed professional, not free)
- **Adult friend/family member** *not involved in the case*
- **Certified mail with return receipt** (sometimes allowed)

🚫 **Not allowed:**

- **The person who requested the PPO**
- **The minor themselves**
- **Anyone under 18**
- **Anyone named in the PPO**

---

### 📬 Methods of Service (Depending on State):

#### 🔹 1. **In-Person (Preferred)**

- The server hands the papers directly to the person named in the PPO.
- They don’t need to accept or read them—they just have to be notified.

#### 🔹 2. **Certified Mail (with Return Receipt)**

- Not available in all states or for emergency PPOs.
- Must show proof that it was delivered and signed for.

#### 🔹 3. **Alternative Service**

- If the person is avoiding service, the court can approve methods like:
  - Posting it on their door
  - Email or social media (rare but possible)
  - Publishing in a newspaper (if they’re missing)

---

### ✍️ Proof of Service

Once served, the person who delivered the papers must fill out a **Proof of Service form** and file it with the court. This is **critical**—without it, the PPO isn’t enforceable, and cops can’t act on it.

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip for PPO Cases:

- In some states, law enforcement will serve PPOs for **free** if it’s a domestic violence case.
- If the parent is dangerous or violent, **do NOT try to serve them yourself.**
  Let the sheriff or a process server handle it safely and legally.

---

### 🔥 TL;DR Summary:

- Papers must be **served legally and documented**.
- The **minor cannot serve them**.
- Use the **sheriff** or a **disinterested adult** over 18.
- **Proof of Service** must be filed with the court.

Here’s how **serving PPO papers** works in Michigan, especially when the respondent or the petitioner is a minor:

---

## 👩‍⚖️ Who Can Serve the Papers

- Must be **someone over 18 who isn’t involved in the case**—not the minor or their “next friend” (the adult who filed for them) citeturn0search1turn0search5.
- Options include:
  - **Sheriff or police** (sometimes free)
  - **Licensed process server**
  - **Trusted adult friend or relative** (must notarize proof of service)

---

## 📨 Methods of Service

1. **In‐person (personal service)**\
   Handing it directly to the respondent (parent or minor) citeturn0search1turn0search5.

2. **Certified or registered mail (restricted delivery)**
   - Mailed only to the respondent; must sign return receipt (“green card”)
   - That signed card is attached to the Proof of Service citeturn0search1turn0search11.

3. **Alternate service**\
   If they’re dodging service, you can ask a **judge** to allow methods like:
   - Posting at their home
   - Email or publication\
     Requires a written motion and court order citeturn0search1.

4. **Oral notice by officer or clerk**\
   In urgent/emergency ex‑parte cases, an officer or clerk may **verbally inform** the respondent and then file a proof of notice citeturn0search11turn0search7.

---

## 🧒 Special Rule When the Respondent or Petitioner Is a Minor

- If the **respondent** (or petitioner) is under 18, **their parent/guardian must also be served**, either in person or by certified mail citeturn0search0turn0search7turn0search5.

---

## 📄 Proof of Service

- Once served, the server must complete the **Proof of Service form**, noting:
  - Date, time, place
  - Method of service
- If served by mail, include the **signed green card** citeturn0search1turn0search11.
- Non-officers must **sign before a notary** citeturn0search1turn0search11.
- File the Proof of Service with the **court clerk** promptly citeturn0search1turn0search11.

---

## 🚓 Entering Into LEIN

- Once the court signs the PPO, it gets entered into Michigan’s **LEIN** database.
- After *service* (or oral notice), law enforcement must update LEIN so **police everywhere can recognize and enforce it** citeturn0search7turn0search1.

---

## ✅ Step‑by‑Step Summary

1. **Choose your server**\
   Over 18, not part of the case—sheriff, process server, or trusted adult.

   In person, certified mail, or alternate (with court permission).

3. **Serve both respondent and minor’s parent/guardian** (if minor involved).

4. **Complete and notarize Proof of Service**, attach green card if mailed.

5. **File the Proof with the court clerk**.

6. **Confirm police enter the served PPO into LEIN** for statewide enforcement.

---

## 🔑 Pro Tips

- Let the server be non‑involved and **extra cautious** if the respondent is volatile.
- Avoid **serving on Sundays or religious holidays**, as Michigan courts generally restrict that citeturn0search19turn0search7.
- **Keep copies** of everything—even your safety depends on proper documentation.

#### You:
What if it's an ex parte ppo?

#### ChatGPT:
If it’s an ex parte PPO in Michigan (meaning the judge issued it without a hearing because they believed immediate protection was needed), the service process is still legally required—but there are some important details:

---

## 📌 What Makes Ex Parte PPOs Different?

- The order goes into effect as soon as the judge signs it.
- The respondent hasn’t had a chance to respond yet.
- It’s often used in emergencies—like when someone’s safety is in immediate danger.

But even though the order is active right away, it must still be formally served on the respondent to be fully enforceable and to start the timeline for them to object.

---

## ✅ How Service Works for Ex Parte PPOs in Michigan

1.   **You (the petitioner) cannot serve it yourself.**

- Someone over 18 who’s not part of the case must serve it. This can be:
  - The sheriff or police (often free for PPOs)
  - A professional process server
  - A neutral adult (like a friend or family member not involved)

2.   **Service must be done “promptly.”**

- Michigan law doesn’t give an exact deadline for service, but it must be done as soon as reasonably possible after the judge signs the order.

3.   **Acceptable methods of service:**

- In person (preferred and most enforceable)
- Certified mail with return receipt (if allowed by the court)
- If normal service isn’t possible, you can file a Motion for Alternate Service and ask the judge for permission to serve another way (like posting, email, or even text in extreme situations).

4.   **If the respondent is a minor:**

- You must also serve their parent or legal guardian.

5.   **Once served:**

- The person who served it must fill out and file a Proof of Service form with the court.
- If mailed, the signed green card (return receipt) must be attached.
- Law enforcement will update the LEIN (Law Enforcement Information Network) once service is confirmed.

---

## ⚠️ If It’s Not Served…

Even though the PPO is technically in effect once signed, law enforcement typically won’t enforce it unless the respondent has been served or notified. So if they violate the order but haven’t been properly served yet, it’s harder to get police to act.

If you're facing delays or the respondent is avoiding service, you can ask the court for:

- A Motion for Alternate Service
- A court order allowing law enforcement to serve them at school, work, or another location

Would you like me to help you find the exact Proof of Service form or instructions for your county (e.g. Ottawa County, Michigan)?


#### You:
So from what I understand is I (and adult over 18) can serve the papers... even if it's an ex parte it still has to go through the parents? (His mom and step dad)?

#### ChatGPT:
You're mostly right — and I’ll walk you through exactly how it works for your situation.

---

### ✅ Yes — An Adult Over 18 Can Serve the PPO

If you're helping someone else (like a minor) who got an ex parte PPO approved in Michigan:

- You can legally serve the papers as long as:
  - You're at least 18 years old
  - You're not involved in the case (not the petitioner or respondent)
  - You’re not listed in the PPO in any way (protected or restrained)

---

### 🧒 If the RESPONDENT (the person the PPO is against) is a MINOR:

Yes — the law requires that you also serve the **minor’s parent or legal guardian**.

So in your case, if:

- The PPO is against a minor (like a younger sibling or peer),
- Then both the minor and their **parent(s)/guardian(s)** — such as their mom and stepdad — must be served with the PPO papers.

📌 That’s true even if it’s an ex parte PPO. Michigan court rules still require the respondent’s legal guardian to be notified if the respondent is under 18.

---

### 🔁 If the PETITIONER (the person who filed the PPO) is a minor:

Then:

- You still need someone else (over 18 and not involved) to serve the PPO to the respondent.
- You do **not** need to serve the petitioner’s parent(s) — unless the court specifically ordered it.

---

### 🧾 After Service:

Whoever does the serving (you, in this case) must fill out a Proof of Service form, have it notarized (if not law enforcement), and file it with the court ASAP.

---

### 🧠 Quick Summary for Your Case:

| Situation              | Do the parents need to be served? |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Respondent is under 18 |                                   |


#### You:
Wait... im filing FOR a minor not against... im doing it against his mom and step father

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for clarifying — that makes a big difference. You’re filing a PPO on behalf of a minor against their parents (his mom and stepdad). Got it.

Here’s exactly how that works in Michigan:

---

## 🛡️ You’re Filing a PPO on Behalf of a Minor (Against Adults)

In this situation:

- You are acting as the minor’s “next friend” — meaning you are helping them file the PPO because they’re under 18.
- The respondents (the people the PPO is against) are the **mom and stepdad**.
- The judge issued an **ex parte PPO** — meaning it's effective immediately without a hearing.

---

## ✅ How Service Works in This Case

1. ✅ Yes — An adult over 18 (including you) can serve the PPO papers.
   - You must be:
     - Not listed in the PPO (not protected or restrained)
     - Not the minor who filed
     - At least 18 years old
   - You can serve the papers yourself or ask the sheriff, process server, or another adult to do it.

2. 📬 Both respondents (mom and stepdad) must be served.
   - Each must receive their own copy of the PPO.
   - If the judge signed separate orders for each one, serve both.

3. 🧾 You (or whoever serves them) must fill out and file a Proof of Service form.
   - If you serve them personally, you’ll need to sign the form in front of a notary.
   - If it’s mailed, you’ll need a green card return receipt (certified mail).
   - Once filed, this makes the PPO officially enforceable.

---

## 🚨 Important: You Cannot Serve If You Are the Petitioner

Even though you're helping the minor, if the PPO lists you as the petitioner (or co-petitioner), then you cannot serve the papers. In that case, someone else — an uninvolved adult over 18 — must do it.

If the minor is the only listed petitioner, and you're just acting as their "next friend," you likely can serve the papers — but it’s safest to check with the court clerk first.

---

## 🧠 Example (Your Case):

- Ayden is the minor.
- You’re helping Ayden file against his mom (Beth) and stepdad (Chris).
- You are not named in the PPO.
  ➡️ You can legally serve the papers to Beth and Chris (separately), either by:
  - Handing them the PPO documents personally, or
  - Sending certified mail with return receipt

Once done, file the Proof of Service form with the court.

---

Let me know if you’d like me to get you:

- The official Proof of Service form
- The sheriff’s contact for help with serving
- A quick checklist of what to deliver and what to file

I can also help draft the PPO language or prepare alternate service forms if Beth or Chris tries to dodge being served.


#### You:
So they still have to fight it?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes — once they've been served with the PPO, they still have the legal right to fight it — but only within a short time window.

Here’s what happens after you serve the ex parte PPO to the mom (Beth) and stepdad (Chris):

---

## 🧾 After Service: Their Options

Once Beth and Chris have been officially served:

### 🔹1. They can choose to follow the PPO and do nothing.

- The PPO remains in effect as issued by the judge.
- It will last until the expiration date (usually up to 1 year) unless you ask for a modification or extension.
- Violating it can lead to arrest and criminal charges.

### 🔹2. They can file a motion to “terminate or modify” the PPO.

- This is how they challenge it.
- They have 14 days from the day they were served to file this motion with the same court.
- The court will then schedule a hearing.

📌 If they miss the 14-day deadline:

- The PPO stays in full effect with no hearing.
- They may lose the chance to fight it unless they can prove extraordinary circumstances.

---

## 🔔 If They Do File to Fight It:

If either of them files a motion to terminate or modify:

- You (and Ayden, if appropriate) will get a court date and notice to appear.
- At the hearing, both sides can present evidence or witnesses.
- The judge will decide whether to keep the PPO, change it, or cancel it.

You do not need a lawyer, but it helps to bring:

- A timeline of incidents
- Any documentation (texts, voicemails, pictures, etc.)
- Witnesses, if possible

If they don’t file to fight it, the PPO just stays in place and becomes enforceable through law enforcement once proof of service is filed.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Action Taken by Respondent | What Happens                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Do nothing                 | PPO stays in effect                           |
| File motion within 14 days | Court hearing is scheduled                    |
| Miss deadline              | PPO stays in effect — hard to challenge later |

### ✅ The PPO Goes Into Effect Immediately

As soon as the judge signs the ex parte PPO, it is active — even before the respondent (Beth or Chris) is served. But...

➡️ It can only be enforced (e.g., by police) after it has been properly served and proof of service is filed with the court.

---

### ⏳ Once Served, They Have 14 Days to Fight It

After Beth and Chris are officially served:

- They each have **14 days** from the date of service to file a Motion to Terminate or Modify the PPO.
- If they don’t file within that time, the PPO remains in full effect until its expiration date.

> ⚠️ The 14-day clock starts the day they are personally handed the PPO or the date the certified mail return receipt is signed.

---

### 🔔 What Happens If They Try to Fight It?

- The court will set a hearing.
- You (and Ayden, if needed) will be notified and given a chance to appear and explain why the PPO should stay in place.
- The judge then decides to:
  - Keep it as-is,
  - Change some terms,
  - Or cancel it.

---

If you want help responding if they try to fight it, I can help you gather what you’ll need for the hearing — like a timeline, screenshots, and what to say.

Would you like me to pull up the official Michigan form they would use if they try to terminate the PPO? That way you'll know exactly what to expect.


#### You:
Okay, so what does Dad do in this case? Ayden is not living with him, he has bi weekly weekends, no custody, how is he affected? What does he have to do? He's the one currently paying support, with zero custody

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — you’re asking what Ayden’s biological dad has to do or expect, given:

- The PPO is filed against Ayden’s mom and stepdad
- Ayden lives with them full-time
- Dad only has biweekly parenting time and no legal custody
- Dad pays child support

Here’s what this means for him legally and practically:

---

## 👨‍👦‍👦 Dad’s Role in This PPO Situation

### ✅ 1. He is **not affected directly** by the PPO — unless:

- He is named in the PPO (he’s not, from what you said)
- His behavior contributed to harm (doesn’t sound like it)
- He tries to interfere with the PPO after it’s issued

Otherwise, Dad is legally in the clear.

---

### 📬 2. He **doesn’t need to be served** the PPO

- Only the respondents (mom and stepdad) must be served.
- The court doesn’t notify him automatically.
- You can choose to let him know what’s happening — but you’re not required to.

---

### 🧾 3. His child support obligation stays in place (for now)

- PPOs do not automatically change custody or support.
- Even if Ayden is removed from Mom’s home, Dad still owes support unless:
  - He gets temporary or permanent custody
  - A court modifies the support order

➡️ He’d have to file a Motion to Change Custody or Support based on the new living situation.

---

### 🏠 4. If Ayden moves in with Dad full-time:

Dad should:

- Immediately notify Friend of the Court (FOC) and the judge involved in the PPO
- File for emergency or temporary custody
- File a motion to suspend or reverse child support (since he’s now the custodial parent)

Courts don’t just stop support automatically — they require a legal filing and hearing.

---

### 💬 5. Dad may want to step up as a protective parent

Even if he has no current custody, the court may see him as a viable, safer alternative to Mom and stepdad.

If he wants to pursue custody, he can:

- File for full custody
- Request a change in the parenting time schedule
- Ask for supervised parenting time for Mom

His chances go way up if Ayden is already staying with him and expresses that he feels safer there.

If you'd like, I can help draft the motion to change custody or suspend support, or help Dad write a declaration to file with the court if Ayden ends up living with him full-time. Just say the word.


#### You:
He doesn't have a place right now, he's staying with a friend. So can you still motion to change the support order to nullify it since the parent receiving child support would not be in custody of Ayden? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes — and this is a very important legal nuance in Michigan.

Even though Dad doesn’t currently have a stable place or legal custody, if Ayden is **no longer living with the parent who receives child support** (Mom), and **Mom has lost physical custody or is under a PPO**, then Dad can absolutely file to:

### ✅ Suspend, Reduce, or Terminate His Child Support Obligation

---

### 🔑 Key Legal Principle in Michigan:

> ❗ Child support is owed to the parent who has **primary physical custody**. If that parent no longer has custody or the child has been removed from their home — even temporarily — the support order becomes factually inaccurate and must be updated.

---

## 🔁 What Dad Should Do Right Now

### 🧾 1. File a Motion to Modify Support

- File a “Motion Regarding Support” with the family court that issued the original order.
- Attach an affidavit or declaration stating:
  - Ayden no longer lives with Mom or stepdad.
  - The home is unsafe (citing the PPO).
  - Child support is no longer appropriate because she is not the custodial parent.
- He doesn’t need to have custody yet to freeze support — just that she’s not entitled to receive it anymore.

➡️ The Friend of the Court (FOC) will likely schedule a support review.

---

### 🏠 2. Clarify His Living Situation Honestly

Even if he’s staying with a friend:

- Courts understand that many protective or displaced parents are in transition.
- If he’s trying to step up and be a safer parent, they may still favor him over Mom/stepdad.
- If Ayden is staying with him even temporarily, that’s strong evidence of a shift in physical custody.

---

### 🧒 3. If Ayden Is in Protective Custody or With a Relative

If Ayden is living with you (a relative), CPS, or another adult:

- Dad can file a motion to stop support to the mom and have the money redirected or paused.
- The court might set support as $0 until a new custodial arrangement is finalized.

---

### 📞 4. Contact Friend of the Court (FOC) Immediately

- Dad should tell them the situation has changed and ask for a support review.
- He can file the support motion while working on custody or a more permanent home plan.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR – Yes, He Can Act

| Issue                               | Answer                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mom no longer has custody           | ✅ Yes — Support can be frozen or redirected                     |
| Dad doesn’t have a home right now   | 🚧 Not ideal, but not disqualifying                             |
| Can support be nullified or paused? | ✅ Yes — via motion and FOC review                               |
| Does he need custody first?         | ❌ No — he just needs to show Mom no longer has physical custody |

Would you like me to draft a sample support modification motion he could file with the Michigan court? Or help locate the form for Ottawa or Muskegon County?


#### You:
Part of the whole reason he doesn't have a place right now is because support is so expensive there's not enough to actually rent or buy a place with

#### ChatGPT:
That makes complete sense — and you’re not alone in that situation. In Michigan (and in many other states), it’s unfortunately common: 

> A noncustodial parent pays so much in support that they can’t afford to establish a stable home — which then gets used against them when seeking custody or more time with their child.

But in this case, the tide may finally be in Dad’s favor.

---

## 💡 Here’s the key leverage:

Since Ayden’s mother (the support recipient) has been named in a PPO — and Ayden may no longer be in her care — Dad can make a strong case that:

1. She is no longer entitled to child support\
2. The current support amount is creating financial hardship\
3. He is trying in good faith to care for Ayden — but can’t do it without relief

---

## ✅ Yes, He Can Use That Reason in Court

In fact, Michigan law allows the court to modify or even suspend support when:

- The child no longer lives with the custodial parent
- The paying parent is unable to maintain basic housing or living expenses due to the support burden
- There’s been a significant change in circumstances (like this PPO and unsafe home)

---

## 📜 What He Can File

### 1. Motion Regarding Support

He can file this with the family court that issued the original order. It should state:

- He is requesting a suspension or reduction of support
- The custodial parent (Mom) is no longer the physical custodian due to safety issues
- He cannot afford housing due to high child support payments
- He is willing and trying to provide care if given the chance

📝 If Ayden is now staying with a relative or another adult, include that too.

---

### 2. Financial Disclosure

The Friend of the Court (FOC) may request a full income/expense report, including:

- Income from all sources
- Rent or housing costs (even if staying with a friend)
- Food, transport, child-related costs
- Debt (especially back support if any)

➡️ This gives the court a clear picture of why the current order is unsustainable.

---

## ⚖️ Michigan-Specific Note

The court’s primary interest is in the well-being of the child — and they know a parent cannot parent well if they’re financially crushed.

Judges and FOC referees may not eliminate support entirely, but they have full discretion to:

- Freeze payments temporarily
- Set support to $0 until custody is resolved
- Eliminate arrears from the date Ayden left Mom’s care
- Recalculate based on Dad’s actual living expenses and limited custody

---

## 🔥 Recommendation

Dad should file ASAP for a support review. In his motion, he can (and should) say:

> “The current child support obligation is preventing me from establishing a safe, stable home for my son. The child is no longer in the care of the recipient. I am requesting temporary suspension or reduction of support so I can take necessary steps to reunify with my child and provide housing.”

---

Would you like help writing this motion or filling out the required forms (with specific Michigan court language)? I can create a sample you can edit and print.


#### You:
Here's a good question for you. Can Dad file to dissolve the FOC case if she no longer retains custody

#### ChatGPT:
That is a very sharp question — and the answer is nuanced, but powerful:

> ❌ No, Dad cannot “dissolve” or terminate the entire Friend of the Court (FOC) case on his own just because Mom no longer has custody.

BUT:

> ✅ He can file to remove enforcement and request to opt out of FOC services — if certain conditions are met.

Let me break it down for Michigan law specifically:

---

## 🔍 What is “Dissolving” an FOC Case?

FOC isn’t something you can just shut down with a switch. It’s a system that manages:

- Custody and parenting time enforcement
- Child support orders and payments
- Health care provisions
- Income withholding

If support or custody orders still exist (even if they no longer reflect the actual situation), the FOC case remains active.

---

## ✅ What Dad Can Do Instead

If the child (Ayden) is no longer with Mom — the FOC support recipient — Dad can do any of the following:

### 🔹 1. File a Motion to Suspend or Eliminate Support

As discussed earlier, based on the custody change and inability to pay.

> If granted, the FOC stops enforcing payments — it doesn’t delete the case, but it effectively freezes it.

### 🔹 2. File a Motion to Change Custody

Even if Ayden isn’t living with Dad yet, Dad can file for custody if:

- Mom has been declared unsafe
- Ayden is living elsewhere
- Dad wants to assume responsibility

This changes the court orders — and FOC will update their enforcement accordingly.

### 🔹 3. Request to Opt Out of FOC Services

Michigan allows parents to file a joint motion to opt out of FOC enforcement, but that’s only possible if:

- Both parties agree (very unlikely here)
- No child support arrears are owed to the state
- A judge approves it

➡️ Since Mom won’t cooperate, this is probably not an option here.

---

## 🔐 Real Solution: Terminate Mom’s Status as Custodial Parent

Instead of trying to “dissolve” the FOC case, Dad should focus on:

✔ Filing a Motion to Change Custody\
✔ Filing a Motion to Modify or Suspend Support\
✔ Submitting evidence that Mom is no longer the physical custodian\
✔ Requesting that support enforcement against him be paused until a new order is issued

Once custody/support orders are corrected, FOC will update their records — and Mom’s role in the case is effectively over.

---

## ⚖️ Bottom Line

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| End FOC case completely        | ❌ Not directly                                 | Not unless all orders are closed or canceled by court |
| Stop child support enforcement | ✅ Yes                                          | File motion to suspend support                        |
| Remove Mom as recipient        | ✅ Yes                                          | File for custody or placement change                  |
| Opt out of FOC entirely        | ❌ Only if both parties agree & no arrears owed |                                                       |

Want help drafting the specific language for a Motion to Suspend Support or Motion to Change Custody based on loss of custodial control? I can prep it.


#### You:
That's what I thought. So basically at 18, the FOC case terminates itself? In June? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes — you're absolutely right.

In Michigan:

> ✅ When the child turns 18, the Friend of the Court (FOC) case for child support will typically terminate automatically — but there are some caveats.

---

## 📆 What Happens at Age 18 in Michigan?

Michigan law says child support ends when the child turns 18 — unless any of the following apply:

1. The child is still in high school and expected to graduate by age 19½
2. There's a court order that extends support beyond age 18 (rare, usually for special needs)
3. There's unpaid back child support (arrears), which the FOC will continue to enforce until paid

---

## ✅ So for most cases:

| Event                            | Effect                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Child turns 18                   | Support obligation ends (usually June if still in school)                |
| Child graduates high school      | If it’s before or around their 18th birthday, support ends               |
| Child still in high school at 18 | Support continues until they graduate or hit 19½ (whichever comes first) |
| Child turns 19½                  | Support stops automatically unless extended by court                     |

---

## 🔧 What Dad Should Do

If Ayden is:

- Graduating in June
- Not receiving services from Mom
- And turning 18 this year...

➡️ Dad can file a Motion to Terminate Support early if he's being wrongly charged after the custodial situation has changed.

Even if he does nothing, FOC will automatically terminate support enforcement based on:

- Graduation date
- Date of birth
- School confirmation (usually verified by FOC directly)

FOC may also send Dad a “Notice of Support Ending” letter shortly before the cutoff.

---

## 🧾 What Will Continue?

- Any unpaid arrears (back support) will still be enforced until paid in full
- Income withholding may continue until the balance hits $0 — even after the child turns 18
- The court/FOC won’t “close” the case file until all debts are cleared

---

### ✅ TL;DR

\| Ayden turns 18 and graduates in June | ✅ Support ends automatically unless arrears exist |
\| Arrears owed                         | ✅ Still enforced until paid                       |
\| FOC still active                     | ✅ Until balance is $0                             |

---

If you'd like, I can help you prepare a Motion to Terminate Support early or verify graduation status with the FOC to accelerate the closure. Just say the word.
