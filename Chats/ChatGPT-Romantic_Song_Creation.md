**Verse 1**\
In the stillness of midnight, when the stars softly gleam,\
Your smile appears—a beacon, brighter than any dream.\
Every heartbeat echoes the warmth you bring around,\
A quiet, pulsing rhythm where my hope is found.

**Chorus**\
You are the secret in my every breath,\
The spark igniting hidden depths.\
In a world of endless wonder, you’re my endless sky,\
A force that lifts my spirit, soaring ever high.

**Verse 2**\
At dawn, your eyes mirror the glow of a new sunrise,\
An unexpected radiance that steadies and mystifies.\
Each step we take, our rhythms gently intertwine,\
Crafting a melody so pure, uniquely divine.

**Bridge**\
When the noise of the day fades into silence deep,\
Your memory sings a ballad that I forever keep.\
No simple word could capture the fire you ignite—\
A passion transcending the mundane, brilliantly bright.

You are the secret in my every breath,\
The spark that awakens soul depths.\
In the vastness of the cosmos, you’re the light that makes me soar,\
An unspoken devotion, echoing forevermore.
