Gardening, making music, and helping people whatever that might entail. I'm extremely passionate about alternative medicine and cures and gardening, less so about electronics but FL studio as a big interest of mine I'm just busy trying to learn other things. 

If I had to pick one it would probably be learning about the mind like NLP hypnosis and life coach stuff, and self-development like the law of attraction, Kevin Trudeau's teachings etc.

2. What areas do you receive the most compliments or recognition for?


#### You:
Well, to be honest, I don't. 

Just at home, that's really where I get compliments. Fro my fiancee. I don't really get compliments or recognition from anyone generally, that's why I joined the Global Information Network. 

#### ChatGPT:
Understood, Justin. Let's move on to the next question.

3. Are there any particular talents or abilities you have that you feel are unique to you?

4. How do you typically solve problems or approach challenges?


#### You:
Depends on if it's at work or at home. If it's at work I might ask for help from a senior agent or management official or contact our own help desk, or if it's at home I would generally just work on a task or issue that needs to be solved.

Thanks for sharing that, Justin. Now let's move on to the next section.

**Section 3: Values and Motivations**

The truth about where we are as humans and why we are here, and what we're doing, and what we're supposed to be doing. What life means and how we should use our lives. And my professional life, retaining professionalism but being social

#### ChatGPT:
Great insights. Here's the next question.

2. What motivates you to get up and work each day?


#### You:
Really the finances. What I do for work currently at the forest service help desk/customer help desk is not really as driving to me as it once was. I don't see myself advancing at all there just getting raises. There's no advancement and helping other teammates does not really have many advantages to me but I do it when I have information to share.

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for your honesty, Justin. Let's proceed to the next question.

3. Do you prefer working independently or as part of a team?


#### You:
I would prefer to work with others, however if there's high intensity focusing required then I prefer to work alone if I have all the direction and information needed to work.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. Moving on to the next question.

4. What kind of work environment do you thrive in (e.g., structured, flexible, high-pressure)?


#### You:
Very structured or flexible. I prefer routine, however if given the choice to have a variety of work times I would choose that. If not given that choice then I prefer to have a specific shift with specific hours all the time. And in terms of pressure, when I put pressure on myself things get done more easily and faster. 

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for the detailed response. Let's move on to the next section.

**Section 4: Experiences and Achievements**

1. What past experiences have you had that were particularly meaningful or impactful?


#### You:
Give me an example of something you might be asking about

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here are a few examples:

- A specific job or project where you felt you made a significant contribution or impact.
- A personal achievement or milestone that had a profound effect on your life.
- An experience where you overcame a major challenge or obstacle.
- A volunteer or extracurricular activity that was particularly rewarding.

Does this help? If so, please share any past experiences that were particularly meaningful or impactful for you.


#### You:
Well I've been at my current position since 2016 and at the same company for 8 years so that definitely has meaning to me as I did my annual review yesterday and this company in particular helps people by not necessarily focusing on the strengths of people with disabilities but rehabilitating people with disabilities so that they can have a full-time or part-time job and get back into the job market. It's peckham.org I'm shared that with you before, Business services division working on the IT help desk. That is really my most significant job experience but as far as personal achievements.. let's see gotten divorced twice from people who were let's say unsavory, and challenges? Yeah 2023 the very start of it, I left a four-year relationship with four children that weren't mine one of them had moved out anyway but two of them were completely disobedient and did not listen and the girl I was with was completely lazy didn't do anything had no ambitions in life that would help at all. I thought this would change over time and I gave her 4 years and it didn't I was the most miserable I've ever been. No self-help could change that for me. Allegedly she's different now and with a different guy but I believe it when I see it which I will never do so for now I don't believe that

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing those experiences, Justin. Let's move on to the next question.

2. Can you describe a time when you felt particularly successful or proud of your work?


#### You:
Yeah we have this thing called shark tank at work where is the name suggests we get to suggest ideas and pitch them to management and then to USDA. Though we're not direct USDA employees, we can share ideas with USDA with our contract manager which is pretty neat. I've suggested them things before and currently have a OneNote notebook that is kind of big and I'm very proud of that. Also in the past I had an Asana task management workspace where myself and three or four others kept knowledge base article edits that we thought were viable and submitted them regularly but that turned out that we weren't allowed to have that information outside of our own workspace if that makes sense so I haven't been doing that. Since everything we have is integrated with office 365 I've been putting stuff in OneNote which is a logical and cohesive approach because no information is getting out or late

#### ChatGPT:
That's a significant achievement, Justin. It sounds like you've contributed valuable ideas and organizational improvements at work. Let's move to the next question.

3. What types of roles or jobs have you enjoyed the most in your past?


#### You:
This is my first real job where I feel accomplished. However in my experience for the last 18 years I've had a few jobs where I felt the most enjoyment. One, was working at a factory for a year where I sat in the back corner and did spring grinding. I ground the ends of springs occasionally heated them and went back to sitting there reading or listening to music and that was quite enjoyable but I was single at the time and then not single so it worked out all right it was enjoyable because I was alone when I did it. Also I enjoy landscaping type jobs a lot cuz I get to be outside but I won't be making $22 an hour. Also enjoy jobs relating to AI but I've never had any of those, but that's definitely something I could see myself doing as I've looked into it quite a bitish. Something I want to make a job is the three things that I suggested to you before we started this questionnaire. One other potential job field that I wouldn't mind going into is web development but being that I'm currently working full time I would like to be paid to learn you know what I mean in my job will not pay me to learn web development

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing your experiences, Justin. Let's move to the next question.

4. Are there any achievements or milestones that you consider significant in your career?


#### You:
Yep I discussed them with you a few questions back 8 years of my current job. Other jobs really weren't that significant but I did work at a warehouse once that I really enjoyed and created a organization system for displays there I forgot to mention that if you wouldn't mind putting that and correlating that with the previous question about particularly successful or proud of my work. That was a very enjoyable job also but definitely way less pay. Also the owner was abusive to me very often and did not view my accomplishments as something that were valuable to him but I was the manager of the warehouse so I kind of ran it my way which was why it was so enjoyable

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for the additional details. I'll make sure to incorporate that information.

Now, let's move on to the next section.

**Section 5: Future Aspirations**

1. What long-term goals do you have for your career?


#### You:
Leaving and creating my own help desk or working somewhere where I feel my contributions are more valuable but for my current career I don't have long-term goals

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing that. Moving on to the next question.

2. Are there any specific industries or fields you are drawn to?


#### You:
Aii, music production, gardening and greenhouse and landscaping, also time and resource management and office management using various different tools that have encountered in my time with the help desk and personally, and mental well-being assistance using nlp, hypnosis, life coaching. There's a few other ones but I don't see them as really professional or career related but I could definitely break into or create new industries with my ideas

#### ChatGPT:
Great, Justin. Let's move on to the next question.

3. What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind through your work?


#### You:
If you're asking how do I want others to see me when I leave, I'd like to be able to share valuable contributions to the organizations that I belong to and then ask about it later and see my contributions still being useful or sharing my OneNote with peckham employees so that they can utilize it themselves

#### ChatGPT:
Understood, Justin. Let's proceed to the next question.

4. How do you envision your ideal work-life balance?


#### You:
Work when I want not when I don't

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for your response, Justin. Let's move on to the final section.

**Section 6: Practical Considerations**

1. What is your preferred work schedule (e.g., standard hours, flexible hours, remote work)?


#### You:
Flexible remote work, when I want, 7:00 to 3:00 if necessary is the best schedule currently for me

#### ChatGPT:
Great. Let's move to the next question.

2. What level of income do you need or desire to support your lifestyle?


#### You:
Double what I'm making now and I thought of some side hustles or gigs or something I could do in the meantime but really 80 plus k

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing. Moving on to the next question.

3. Are there any geographical locations you prefer to work in or avoid?


#### You:
That's not really applicable right now I'm kind of stuck in Michigan but no that one doesn't really apply

#### ChatGPT:
Understood. Let's move to the final question in this section.

4. How do you feel about job security versus job flexibility?


#### You:
Where I work right now has kind of the ultimate job security because people with disabilities work there so their disabilities are worked into the contract being that we work with the service contract act and disabilities are always considered throughout each part of the job, so that's why I've held this job for so long.

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for your thorough responses, Justin. Now that we have gone through all the questions for the career and job path quiz, we can analyze your answers to identify common themes and insights that might help clarify your ideal career path.
