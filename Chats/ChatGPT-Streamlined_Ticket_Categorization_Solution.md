Pitch for Prewritten Ticket Categorization System

Introduction

Hello [Management Team/Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to propose a solution that could significantly improve our helpdesk efficiency and agent well-being. As part of the tech support team for USDA, I have observed recurring patterns in the types of tickets we handle daily. Based on these observations, I propose the development and implementation of a prewritten ticket categorization system.

Problem Statement

Currently, agents spend a considerable amount of time typing out common tickets, reading over their notes, and sometimes struggling to interpret what was previously written. This process:

Increases the Average Call Duration (ACD)
Extends the After Call Work (ACW) time
Adds to the overall call handling time, reducing the number of calls we can manage
Contributes to agent stress and fatigue, especially with longform issues that are complex and time-consuming
Proposed Solution

The prewritten ticket categorization system aims to streamline the process by:

Categorizing Common Tickets:

Identify and categorize common issues that we encounter frequently.
Develop a library of prewritten ticket templates for these common issues.
Implementing Templates:

Create easy-to-use templates that agents can quickly select and populate with minimal additional details.
Ensure these templates are comprehensive and cover the necessary troubleshooting steps and resolutions.
Training and Integration:

Provide training for agents on how to effectively use the new system.
Integrate the templates into our existing ticketing system for seamless use.
Benefits

Increased Efficiency:

Reduces the time agents spend typing and reviewing notes.
Cuts down on call times, allowing us to handle a higher volume of calls.
Consistency and Accuracy:

Ensures consistent and accurate information is recorded for common issues.
Minimizes the risk of errors or omissions in ticket notes.
Reduced Agent Stress:

Simplifies the ticketing process, reducing the cognitive load on agents.
Allows agents to focus more on resolving complex issues rather than administrative tasks.
Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:

Faster resolution times improve the overall customer experience.
Ensures customers receive consistent and accurate information.
Implementation Plan

Data Collection:

Analyze the types of tickets received over the past six months to identify common issues.
Collaborate with agents to gather insights on the most frequent and time-consuming issues.
Template Development:

Draft initial templates for the identified common issues.
Review and refine templates based on agent feedback.
Training and Rollout:

Conduct training sessions for agents to familiarize them with the new templates.
Gradually roll out the templates, starting with a pilot group to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
Continuous Improvement:

Regularly review and update the templates based on agent and customer feedback.
Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as ACD, ACW, and customer satisfaction to measure the impact.
Conclusion

Implementing a prewritten ticket categorization system has the potential to transform our helpdesk operations. By improving efficiency, reducing stress, and enhancing the customer experience, we can better support our mission and our team. I look forward to discussing this proposal further and exploring how we can implement this solution to benefit everyone involved.

Thank you for considering this proposal.

Best regards,
Justin
