# GitHub Repo Tree Export

#### You:
Is there an extension, plugin,or tool or adddon for Github that takes a repo and sends it to a txt so you can view it in a differ or something? not the conflict resolution tool, but more like in windows Dir /recurse >pipetofile.txt but for github

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin. You’re describing a **repo “directory listing” exporter**—something that outputs the entire file/folder structure (optionally with file sizes or other metadata) of a GitHub repo into a plain text format. That’s not the same as a *diff* or merge/conflict resolution tool, but more of a “project inventory” or “tree snapshot” you can view in Notepad++ or diff with other exports.

Here’s **how you can do this**, both with tools and some dead-simple code—choose whichever fits your workflow best:

---

## 🛠️ 1. Browser Extensions & Tools

### **A. GitHub Repo Tree Downloaders**

- **“GitHub Tree to Text” Chrome Extensions:** There *have* been browser extensions that scrape and output the visible file tree on GitHub to text, but many are unreliable or don’t recurse into folders.
- **[Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/)**
  - Adds a sidebar to GitHub showing the repo tree, but doesn’t directly export to text. However, you *can* expand all and then “Copy as Text” the sidebar, though this is a bit hacky and won’t include nested folders as pretty as a dir command.

### **B. Online Tools**

- **[GitHub Tree Generator](https://github.com/lukechilds/github-directory-downloader)**
  - Not specifically for TXT export, but can generate JSON or lists of files, which you could process.

---

## 🧑‍💻 2. Simple Command-Line One-Liners

### **A. Using `git` and `find`**

Clone the repo (if you have local access), then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
find . -type f > repo-list.txt
```

- This lists all files, recursively, similar to `dir /s/b`.
- For *just directories*, use `find . -type d`.
- If you want a “tree” view:
  ```sh
  tree /f > repo-tree.txt   # On Windows (with tree command)
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  tree -a > repo-tree.txt   # On Linux/Mac (install 'tree' if needed)
  ```

---

## 🌐 3. Web-based Quick Tools

### **A. GitHub API**

- You can grab a directory tree using GitHub’s [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-repository-content), but it’s easiest with third-party tools or scripts (see below).

---

## 📝 4. Simple Scripts for TXT Export

### **A. Python Script for Repo Tree**

```python
import os

def walk_dir(root_dir, file_obj):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root_dir):
        level = root.replace(root_dir, '').count(os.sep)
        indent = ' ' * 4 * level
        file_obj.write(f'{indent}{os.path.basename(root)}/\n')
        sub_indent = ' ' * 4 * (level + 1)
        for f in files:
            file_obj.write(f'{sub_indent}{f}\n')

with open('repo_tree.txt', 'w') as f:
    walk_dir('.', f)
```

- Place this in the root of your cloned repo, run it, and you get a nice indented tree.

---

## 🧩 5. VS Code Extensions

### **A. “Project Manager” or “Explorer Export” Extensions**

- Some [VS Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager) let you export folder structures, but most don’t export as text out of the box.
- **Manual way**: In the VS Code sidebar, select the folders, right-click, “Copy Path”, and paste into a text file. For advanced, install the [Project Explorer Exporter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-duplicate) or similar.

---

## 🧪 **Experimental/Custom Tools**

### **GitHub Actions / CI Workflow**

- You *could* make a GitHub Action that dumps the repo structure to a TXT file on every push and uploads it as an artifact.

| `tree /f > txt`        | Pretty tree (with files) |        ✅\*       |     ✅    |      ✅     |
| Octotree + Copy        | Manual, not pretty       |         ✅        |     ✅    |      ✅     |
| Python Script          | Customizable tree as txt |        ✅\*       |     ✅    |      ✅     |
| GitHub API             | All repo files as JSON   |         ✅        |     ✅    |      ✅     |
| VS Code Extensions     | (Some) Tree as text/csv  |         ✅        |     ✅    |      ✅     |

## **TL;DR / Best “Github Dir > TXT” Alternatives:**

- **For local repos:** Use `tree /f > repo-tree.txt` (Win) or `tree -a > repo-tree.txt` (Linux/Mac), or the Python script above.
- **For pure-GitHub/no local access:** Use browser “Copy as Text” from Octotree, or download as ZIP and extract tree.
- **No single plugin does exactly what you ask *in the GitHub UI* (yet)**, but several workflow hacks can get you 95% there.
