# VPN Policy Automation

#### You:
Is there a way in win11 or win10 to force a certain policy application as SOON as the VPN is connected? 
For example, 1day exemption policy applies upon vpn connect? 

#### ChatGPT:
In Windows 10 and Windows 11, enforcing a policy to apply as soon as a VPN connection is established requires a combination of Group Policy, PowerShell scripts, and possibly VPN configuration. Here's a high-level overview of how you can set up such a mechanism:

### Steps to Enforce Policy Application on VPN Connection:

1. **Use Group Policy or Local Security Policies**
   - Group Policy settings (if you manage devices in an Active Directory environment) can be used to define and deploy policies based on specific triggers.
   - Policies are typically applied at system startup, user login, or during a Group Policy refresh cycle. To enforce immediate application, you'd need to trigger a policy refresh upon VPN connection.

2. **Leverage Task Scheduler to Trigger Scripts**
   - Use the Task Scheduler to detect when a VPN connection is established and run a script that applies the desired policy or configuration.
   - Here's how to set it up:
     - Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`).
     - Create a new task and set the trigger to "On an Event."
     - For VPN events, monitor the **Microsoft-Windows-NetworkProfile/Operational** log for event IDs indicating a VPN connection. Example: Event ID 10000 for "VPN connected."
     - Set the action to run a PowerShell script that applies your policy or executes desired commands.

3. **PowerShell Script to Apply Policy**
   - Create a PowerShell script that applies the policy. For example, to set a Group Policy update:
     ```powershell
     gpupdate /force
     ```
   - If you need to set a registry key or a specific policy dynamically, use `Set-ItemProperty` or similar cmdlets.

4. **Automate Policy Application**
   - If using an exemption policy that requires dynamic configuration, your script might modify registry settings, network policies, or even interact with third-party VPN software APIs to enforce the exemption.

5. **VPN Software Integration**
   - Some VPN solutions, like Cisco AnyConnect or OpenVPN, allow for custom scripts or commands to be executed upon connection. Check if your VPN client supports such functionality and deploy the script at the VPN connection point.

6. **Optional: Use Windows Firewall Rules**
   - If the policy pertains to network access, you can create a dynamic Windows Firewall rule that applies based on the connection type (e.g., public, private, or domain) or VPN-specific interfaces.

### Example: Immediate 1-Day Policy Exemption

To apply a 1-day exemption policy:

1. Write a script that sets the exemption policy in the registry or via Group Policy preferences.
2. Use Task Scheduler to execute this script immediately upon detecting the VPN connection event.
3. Set a timer or schedule to revert the policy after 24 hours if needed.

#### You:
But if that policy can only reach the computer upon VPN connect, there's no way to tasksched it. 

#### ChatGPT:
You're correct that if the policy can only reach the computer once the VPN is connected (e.g., a policy deployed via Active Directory or a cloud-based policy management system like Intune), Task Scheduler wouldn't be the trigger since it wouldn't have the network access until the VPN is active.

In this case, the solution requires a method to **force a policy refresh immediately upon VPN connection**, based on external triggers like VPN events.

### Here's how you can achieve this:

#### 1. **Leverage VPN Client Features**

Most enterprise VPN clients, such as Cisco AnyConnect, Fortinet, or Palo Alto GlobalProtect, have built-in scripting capabilities to execute commands or scripts upon connection.

- Check the documentation of your VPN client for a "post-connect script" or similar feature.
- Write a script to trigger a **Group Policy refresh** or other policy updates.
- Example script:
  ```powershell
  gpupdate /force
  ```
  This ensures the Group Policy updates as soon as the VPN connects.

#### 2. **Monitor VPN Network State Changes**

If your VPN client doesn't support post-connect scripting, you can monitor the system for changes in network state to detect when the VPN connects.

- Use **PowerShell** to monitor for VPN interface changes:
  ```powershell
  Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*VPN*" -and $_.Status -eq "Up" }
  ```
  - Combine this with a loop or a scheduled script that checks periodically and runs `gpupdate /force` when the VPN interface is active.

#### 3. **Use Scheduled Group Policy Updates**

If you can't directly trigger policy application:

- **Set Group Policy to refresh automatically on a short interval**:
  - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) on your domain controller.
  - Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Group Policy`.
  - Enable `Group Policy Refresh Interval for Computers`.
  - Set the interval to a very short period (e.g., 5 minutes) to minimize the delay after VPN connection.

#### 4. **Dynamic DNS Trigger**

If the policy is hosted in an environment accessible only through VPN:

- Use a script to **check domain connectivity** dynamically.
  - Example PowerShell script:
    ```powershell
    if (Test-Connection -ComputerName "your.domain.com" -Count 1 -Quiet) {
        gpupdate /force
    }
    ```
  - Trigger this script periodically or through Task Scheduler.

#### 5. **Combine VPN and Policy Timing**

- If your environment uses Intune or another MDM solution, ensure policies have a "check-in" period that aligns with VPN usage. This may involve configuring the policy management system to sync more frequently when the device is reachable.

### Limitations and Alternatives

- **Policy Delays**: If policies are only accessible via VPN, there will always be a slight delay while the system connects to the VPN and syncs.
- **Third-Party Tools**: Consider third-party tools designed for remote policy enforcement that work independently of VPN, such as Intune or similar cloud-based solutions.
