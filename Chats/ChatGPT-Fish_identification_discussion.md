What kind of fish is this Onyx

#### ChatGPT:
From these images, the fish has a long, cylindrical body and is partially submerged near the surface with what looks like a pattern of diamond-like scales visible. Based on the shape and coloration, it resembles a **gar**—most likely a **longnose gar** (*Lepisosteus osseus*).

**Key features matching a gar:**

- Long, slender body.
- Distinct scale pattern that looks like armor plating.
- Behavior of floating near the surface, often among debris or vegetation.

Gars are often found in slow-moving rivers, lakes, and backwaters. They tend to stay near the surface to breathe air occasionally.

#### You:
I'm in West Michigan

#### ChatGPT:
Thanks for clarifying you're in **West Michigan**. That helps narrow it down.\
In Michigan waters, the fish you photographed is almost certainly a **Longnose Gar** (*Lepisosteus osseus*).

### Why it’s likely a Longnose Gar:

- **Habitat:** Common in Michigan’s slow-moving rivers and backwaters.
- **Body shape:** Long, cylindrical, and slightly armored-looking.
- **Behavior:** They often float just below the surface, like in your photos.
- **Coloration:** Dark olive to brown back with lighter sides, showing visible scale patterning.

### Why not Pike or Bowfin:

- **Pike:** Has a more torpedo-shaped body, lacks the distinct "armored" scale pattern, and usually has visible dorsal fin farther back.
- **Bowfin:** Thicker body and continuous dorsal fin, very different from the slender, almost prehistoric look of a gar.

You actually captured a pretty cool species—gars are ancient fish that have changed very little over millions of years.

Want me to give you **some facts about Longnose Gar in Michigan** (size, behavior, and if they’re safe to handle)?

Here are some images of the **Longnose Gar** from Michigan and similar freshwater habitats. You'll notice its signature long, narrow snout, armored diamond-patterned scales, and torpedo-shaped body.

### ✅ This is What a Longnose Gar Looks Like

#### 🔍 Key Identifying Features:

- **Elongated snout** nearly three times the length of the head, filled with needle-like teeth.
- **Ganoid (armored) scales** arranged in a diamond pattern.
- Torpedo-shaped body, typically olive‑brown to green, matching murky water environments.citeturn0search16turn0search6
- Gars often suspend within a few feet of the surface near vegetation or debris.citeturn0search0turn0search3

#### 📍 Michigan Relevance:

- Longnose gars are native and widely distributed in Michigan—found in rivers, lakes, and most of the Great Lakes, except Lake Superior.citeturn0search0turn0search1turn0search11
- They thrive in slow-moving, nutrient-rich waters and often surface to breathe, especially during hot summers when oxygen levels drop.citeturn0search3turn0search1
- Michigan's state record gar measured 53 inches long (weighing approximately 18 pounds).citeturn0search7

### 🐟 Match with Your Photos

Your photo shares these exact characteristics:

- Submerged near the surface, close to vegetation.
- Diamond-patterned armor scales visible.
- Slender, elongated body form.

All this strongly supports that what you observed is indeed a **Longnose Gar (Lepisosteus osseus)** — a prehistoric-looking and fascinating native species of Michigan.
