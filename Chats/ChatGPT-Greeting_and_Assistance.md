How do you play this game

#### ChatGPT:
The image explains the rules of "The Game," which is a popular mental game. Here's how you play:

1. **You are always playing The Game**: There is no way to opt out once you know about it.
2. **You cannot win The Game**: The objective is not to win, as winning is impossible.
3. **You lose whenever you remember The Game**: If you think about The Game, you lose.
4. **Announce your loss**: Whenever you remember The Game, you have to say out loud, "I lose."
5. **30-minute grace period**: After losing, you have 30 minutes during which you can remember The Game without losing again.
6. **Spread The Game**: As soon as you mention The Game to someone else, they start playing too.
7. **Ultimate goal**: The aim is to have everyone on Earth playing The Game.

By reading this, you have likely remembered The Game and thus lost it.

So, make it easier to understand. This is incredibly hard to understand

Sure, here's a simpler version:

1. **You are now playing The Game**.
2. **You cannot win The Game; you can only lose**.
3. **You lose The Game whenever you think about The Game**.
4. **When you lose, you must say "I lose" out loud**.
5. **After losing, you have 30 minutes where you can't lose again, even if you think about The Game**.
6. **If you tell someone about The Game, they start playing too**.
7. **The goal is to get everyone on Earth to play The Game**.

In essence: Try not to think about The Game. If you do, you lose and have to tell someone. Then they start playing too.
