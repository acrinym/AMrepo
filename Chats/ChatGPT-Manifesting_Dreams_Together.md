# Manifesting Dreams Together

#### You:
Help me write a song to my love, she wants to go far in life with me, and I do as well. I want to have an the fine things and travel and go lots of planes, have experiences no one else can. For that we need to focus with intention on our dreams and manifest reality. 

Here's the lyrics Chirp generated, I think they're lame. Can your improve them? 

[Verse]
Walking on the sun
Hand in hand we run
Dreams of gold unfold
You and me so bold

[Verse 2]
City lights at night
Holding you so tight
Jet planes in the sky
High above we fly

[Chorus]
We will rise
No surprise
Chasing dreams
Life's supreme

[Verse 3]
Castles by the sea
Living wild and free
Serenade the moon
We will get there soon

[Bridge]
Riches in our hands
We'll take a stand
Living the dream
Life's a streaming beam

[Chorus]
We will rise
No surprise
Chasing dreams
Life's a gleam

[Verse 1] 
Life is a game, 
We play it as we may, 
Make the stars align, 
Have everything we need, 
The wealth of the world we seed.
