You could write the helpdesk ticket as follows:

#### You:
Can you transfer ARK Mobile saves to PC? 

#### ChatGPT:
Transferring ARK Mobile saves directly to the PC version of the game is not officially supported. ARK: Survival Evolved on mobile and PC are different platforms with different save file structures and features. Here are some key points and alternative suggestions:

1. **Official Support**: There is no official support for transferring saves between ARK Mobile and the PC version. The game developers have not provided tools or methods for this kind of transfer.

2. **Different Game Versions**: ARK Mobile and the PC version of ARK: Survival Evolved have differences in terms of content, features, and updates, which makes direct save file transfers incompatible.

3. **Alternative Suggestions**:
   - **Manual Recreation**: If you want to play on PC, you could manually recreate your progress in the PC version. This would involve manually building your structures and taming creatures again.
   - **Server Transfer**: If you were playing on a dedicated server on mobile, you could set up a similar server on PC and recreate the environment as closely as possible.
   - **Cross-Platform Play**: Check for any unofficial mods or community tools that might facilitate the transfer, but be cautious as these are not officially supported and could risk data loss or corruption.

4. **Backup**: Always ensure you have a backup of your mobile save files before attempting any kind of transfer or modification.
