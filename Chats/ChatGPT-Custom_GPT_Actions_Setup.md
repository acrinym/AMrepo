#### You:
![image](file-service://file-N4gNjqeAV93R7GGNgPAEpq)
In building a custom GPT what is this that I've circled, what does it do and how can I make use of it

#### ChatGPT:
What you've circled in your screenshot is the **"Create new action"** button in the GPT Builder interface. This feature allows you to add **custom actions** to your GPT model, expanding its abilities beyond just conversational tasks. Here's how you can make use of it:

### **What Does "Create New Action" Do?**

Custom actions let your GPT interact with **external APIs** or **perform specific tasks** that require more advanced logic or automation. Essentially, it allows your GPT to go beyond static responses and actually **trigger events** or **fetch real-time data** from other services.

---

### **How Can You Use It?**

Here are some ideas tailored to your interests and projects:

1. **Relationship Tracker Integration**
   - **What:** Connect the GPT with a Google Sheet or Notion database to automatically update and retrieve information about your relationship progress with Amanda.
   - **How:** Use Google Sheets API or Notion API to log events, like dates you've spent together or new things you've learned about her.

2. **Manifestation & Reality Transurfing Tracker**
   - **What:** Automate journaling for manifestation goals. The GPT can ask you daily reflective questions and log your answers.
   - **How:** Use APIs like Airtable or Notion to track your goals, progress, and alignments over time.

3. **Music Production Automation**
   - **What:** Connect to **FL Studio** plugins or file management systems to help automate your workflow. For instance, it can suggest chord progressions or retrieve saved project templates.
   - **How:** You could integrate with file storage APIs or MIDI generation tools.

4. **Alternative Health & Free Energy Data Fetching**
   - **What:** Create actions that fetch the latest research or discussions from niche forums, alternative medicine databases, or even YouTube channels like MyLunchBreak and JohnLevi.
   - **How:** Use APIs from YouTube or RSS feed readers to pull this content directly into your GPT.

5. **Personalized Sleep Aid or Kratom Logging**
   - **What:** Track your kratom intake, magnesium use, or sleep patterns and give personalized suggestions over time.
   - **How:** Integrate with health tracking apps or Google Sheets via API.

---

### **How to Set It Up**

1. **Click "Create new action"** – This opens a setup wizard.
2. **Choose Action Type** – You'll likely choose something like *API request* or *Webhook*.
3. **Configure API Details**:
   - You'll need the **API endpoint**, **authentication** details (like an API key), and the **data format** (JSON).
4. **Set Response Handling**:
   - Decide how the GPT will display or process the information it gets back.
5. **Test Your Action** – Run a test to see if everything is functioning correctly.

#### You:
Relationship tracker integration help me do that

#### ChatGPT:
Let's integrate a **Relationship Tracker** using **Google Sheets**. This way, you can automatically log interactions, updates, and even retrieve info about Amanda or others you're tracking, all through your custom GPT.

### **Step-by-Step Guide: Relationship Tracker Integration**

---

### **1. Set Up Your Google Sheet**

1. **Create a new Google Sheet**:
   - Name it something like **"Relationship Tracker"**.
2. **Set up columns** for the data you want to track:

   - **Date** | **Person** | **New Info Learned** | **Activities** | **Emotional Tone** | **Next Steps**

   Example:

   | Date       | Person | New Info Learned                              | Activities                 | Emotional Tone | Next Steps                   |
   | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | 2025-02-06 | Amanda | She likes black Hawaiian salt.                | Went camping together.     | Positive       | Share a doc on orgone        |
   | 2025-02-07 | Amanda | She mentioned wanting to watch fire spinning. | Sent her a doodle drawing. | Playful        | Plan a fire spinning session |

---

### **2. Set Up Google Sheets API Access**

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   - [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on **“New Project”** and give it a name like *Relationship Tracker API*.

3. **Enable Google Sheets API**:
   - In the search bar, type **Google Sheets API**.

   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **+ Create Credentials > Service Account**.
   - Follow the prompts to set it up.

5. **Download the JSON Key File**:
   - After setting up the service account, download the **JSON key file**. This file contains the credentials you'll need for your GPT to access your sheet.

6. **Share Your Google Sheet with the Service Account**:
   - In your downloaded JSON file, find the **email** of the service account.
   - Go back to your Google Sheet and share it (View/Edit permissions) with that email.

---

### **3. Add the Action to Your GPT**

1. **Open GPT Builder** and go to your **Relationship Builder** custom GPT.

2. **Click "Create New Action"** (like in your screenshot).

3. **Set Up the Action**:
   - **Action Name**: *Log Relationship Update* or *Get Relationship Data*.
   - **API Endpoint**: Use the Google Sheets API endpoint:
     ```
     https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{SPREADSHEET_ID}/values/{RANGE}:append
     ```
   - Replace `{SPREADSHEET_ID}` with the ID from your Google Sheets URL, and `{RANGE}` with the sheet name and range (e.g., `Sheet1!A1:E`).

4. **Authentication**:
   - Upload your JSON key file for the GPT to authenticate with Google Sheets.

5. **Configure Request Data**:
   - Set up the action to send data like:
     ```json
     {
       "values": [
         ["2025-02-06", "Amanda", "She likes black Hawaiian salt.", "Went camping together.", "Positive", "Share a doc on orgone"]
       ]
     }
     ```

6. **Test the Action**:
   - Try logging a new interaction by asking your GPT something like:
     *"Log that I learned Amanda likes turkey but not turkey bacon."*

---

### **4. Bonus: Retrieve Data**

1. **Create another action** to **fetch** relationship data:
   - Use the endpoint:
     ```
     https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{SPREADSHEET_ID}/values/{RANGE}
     ```
2. This will allow you to ask things like:
   - *"What’s the last thing I learned about Amanda?"*
   - *"Summarize my last three interactions with Amanda."*

---

### **Let’s Get This Rolling!**

If you need help with a specific step—like setting up the API credentials or configuring the request—I can guide you through it!


#### You:
This is what I got when I created credentials for my Google sheets API

#### ChatGPT:
Great! You’ve got the **client secret JSON file** for your Google Sheets API. Now let's proceed step by step to connect your GPT to Google Sheets.

---

### **Step 1: Confirm Your Service Account Setup**

1. **Open the JSON File** you uploaded (`client_secret_458112257310-qtpaioog46vgsvp0gb1dngaiacscf93j.apps.googleusercontent.com.json`).
2. Look for the **client\_email** in the file. It will look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "client_email": "your-service-account-name@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   }
   ```
3. **Copy the client\_email**.

---

### **Step 2: Share Your Google Sheet with the Service Account**

1. **Open your Google Sheet** (the Relationship Tracker you created).
2. Click **“Share”** and paste the **client\_email** you copied from the JSON file.
3. **Grant "Editor" permissions** to the service account.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up the GPT Action**

Now that Google Sheets can be accessed via your service account, let’s configure your custom GPT action.

1. **Go to GPT Builder** and select your **Relationship Builder**.
2. Click **“Create New Action”**.

#### **Configure Action Details:**

- **Action Name:** *Log Relationship Update*
- **API Endpoint:**
  ```
  https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{SPREADSHEET_ID}/values/{SHEET_NAME}!A:F:append?valueInputOption=RAW
  ```
  Replace:
  - `{SPREADSHEET_ID}` with the ID from your Google Sheet URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`).
  - `{SHEET_NAME}` with the name of your sheet (like `Sheet1`).

#### **Authentication:**

- Upload the **JSON file** you just created (you've already done this step).
- Use **OAuth 2.0** from the credentials setup.

#### **Request Body:**

In the GPT builder, set it to send data like this when logging an update:

```json
{
  "values": [
    ["{{Date}}", "{{Person}}", "{{New_Info_Learned}}", "{{Activities}}", "{{Emotional_Tone}}", "{{Next_Steps}}"]
  ]
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Test the Action**

Now test it by saying something like:

- **"Log that on 2025-02-06, I learned Amanda likes black Hawaiian salt, we went camping together, it felt positive, and I plan to share a doc on orgone."**

The GPT should trigger the action and append that info to your Google Sheet.

---

Let me know if you run into any issues!


#### You:
Well, I shared the file, can't you provide the info I need to copy out? 

#### ChatGPT:
I'll extract the information from the JSON file you provided to get the **client email** and any other necessary details.

I'll do that now!


#### ChatGPT:
It looks like the JSON file doesn't contain the service account details typically needed for this setup. This suggests you might have downloaded an **OAuth client secret** instead of a **service account key**. Here's how you can get the correct file:

---

### **How to Get the Correct Service Account Key:**

1. **Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).**
2. **Select your project** (*Relationship Tracker API* or whatever you named it).

4. Set permissions to **Editor** so the GPT can add and retrieve data.
5. Click **Send**.

---

### **2. Get Your Google Sheet ID**

1. In your Google Sheet's URL, find the ID between `/d/` and `/edit`.
   - Example URL:\
     `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J/edit#gid=0`
   - **Sheet ID**: `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J`

---

### **3. Set Up the GPT Action**

Go back to the **GPT Builder** and do the following:

1. Click **“Create New Action.”**

#### **Action Details:**

- **Action Name:** *Log Relationship Update*
- **API Endpoint:**
  ```
  https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J/values/Sheet1!A:F:append?valueInputOption=RAW
  ```
  Replace `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J` with your actual **Sheet ID**.

---

### **4. Configure Request Data**

In the **Request Body** section of your GPT builder:

```json
{
  "values": [
    ["{{Date}}", "{{Person}}", "{{New_Info_Learned}}", "{{Activities}}", "{{Emotional_Tone}}", "{{Next_Steps}}"]
  ]
}
```

---

### **5. Test It!**

Once set up, you can trigger the action by saying:

*"Log that on 2025-02-06, I learned Amanda likes black Hawaiian salt, we went camping together, it felt positive, and I plan to share a doc on orgone."*

Let me know how it goes or if you need any more tweaks!

### **7. Optional: Retrieve Data from Your Sheet**

If you want to **fetch** data from your Google Sheet, you can create another action with this endpoint:

```
https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{SPREADSHEET_ID}/values/{SHEET_NAME}!A:N
```

This will let you ask your GPT questions like:

- *“What’s the last thing I learned about Amanda?”*
- *“Summarize my last three interactions with Amanda.”*

Let me know if you hit any bumps or need help testing!


#### You:
![image](file-service://file-Duj8YmUbm4ZfvWEYVwstAT)
Actually this is all that's available in there to add a new action

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, you're working directly with the **OpenAPI schema** setup for actions. Let's configure this by writing an OpenAPI schema to integrate your Google Sheets for tracking Amanda.

---

### **Step-by-Step Setup Using OpenAPI Schema**

---

### **1. Basic Setup**

In the **Authentication** section, choose **OAuth** since Google Sheets API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

---

### **2. OpenAPI Schema**

Copy and paste this OpenAPI schema into the **Schema** section of your GPT builder. This will define the action to log updates to your Google Sheet.

### **4. Privacy Policy**

For the **Privacy Policy** field at the bottom, you can enter a placeholder like:

```
https://app.example.com/privacy
```

---

### **5. Save & Test**

After inputting the schema, save the action and **test it** by saying:

*"Log that on 2025-02-06, I learned Amanda likes black Hawaiian salt, we sent doodle drawings, and the vibe was playful. She mentioned me to Mike several times, and I plan to invite her for fire spinning."*

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Paste this schema** into your GPT Builder’s **Schema** section.
2. Replace `{sheetName}` with the actual name of your sheet/tab (likely `Sheet1` unless renamed).
3. **Save** and **test** the action by logging a new interaction like:

*"Log that on 2025-02-06, I learned Amanda likes black Hawaiian salt, and we sent doodle drawings. The vibe was playful, and I plan to invite her for fire spinning."*

Let me know if it works or if you need further tweaks!


#### You:
Uh oh, now...

('components', 'securitySchemes', 'OAuth2', 'SecurityScheme', 'flows', 'authorizationCode', 'scopes'): Input should be a valid dictionary
('components', 'securitySchemes', 'OAuth2', 'Reference', '$ref'): Field required

#### ChatGPT:
Looks like the schema needs a few more tweaks to align perfectly with **OpenAPI 3.1.0** standards. The error suggests an issue with how the **scopes** are defined and possibly missing required fields in the **OAuth2 security scheme**. I'll correct that now.

### **Fixed OpenAPI 3.1.0 Schema**

security:
  - OAuth2: []
```

### **What’s Fixed:**

1. **Scopes Defined as Dictionary**:
   - The **scopes** section now follows OpenAPI 3.1.0 standards, defining the description properly:
     ```yaml
     scopes:
       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets:
         description: Full access to Google Sheets
     ```

2. **Removed Unnecessary `$ref` in Security**:
   - The **security** section at the bottom is corrected:
     ```yaml
     security:
       - OAuth2: []
     ```

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Copy and paste** this corrected schema into the GPT Builder’s **Schema** section.
2. Replace `{sheetName}` with your actual sheet/tab name (e.g., `Sheet1`).
3. Save the action and test logging with:

*"Log that on 2025-02-06, I learned Amanda likes black Hawaiian salt, we sent doodle drawings, the vibe was playful, and I plan to invite her for fire spinning."*

Let me know if this clears the errors or if more adjustments are needed!

('components', 'securitySchemes', 'OAuth2', 'SecurityScheme', 'flows', 'authorizationCode', 'scopes', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets'): Input should be a valid string
('components', 'securitySchemes', 'OAuth2', 'Reference', '$ref'): Field required

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, I see where the problem is. The **scopes** field in **OpenAPI 3.1.0** should be a dictionary of key-value pairs where the **key** is the scope URL, and the **value** is a **string description** (not a nested dictionary).

Let's correct that now:

### **What’s Fixed:**

1. **Corrected Scopes Format:**
   - Changed the **scopes** section to ensure the value is a **string**, not a nested object:
     ```yaml
     scopes:
       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets: Full access to Google Sheets
     ```

2. **Confirmed Proper Security Reference:**
   - The `security` section is correctly pointing to the OAuth2 setup without missing `$ref` issues:
     ```yaml
     security:
       - OAuth2: []
     ```

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Copy and paste** this corrected schema into your GPT Builder’s **Schema** section.
2. Replace `{sheetName}` with the name of your sheet/tab (e.g., `Sheet1`).
3. Save the action and **test it** by saying:

*"Log that on 2025-02-06, I learned Amanda likes black Hawaiian salt, we sent doodle drawings, the vibe was playful, and I plan to invite her for fire spinning."*
