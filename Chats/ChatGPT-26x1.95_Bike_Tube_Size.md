#### You:
What is the right tube for a 26x195 bike tire? 

#### ChatGPT:
For a **26x1.95** bike tire, you want a tube that fits both the diameter (26 inches) and the width (1.95 inches). Here's what to look for:

### **Correct Tube Size:**

- Look for tubes labeled **26 x 1.75–2.125**\
  This range includes your **1.95" width**, so it will fit perfectly.

### **Valve Type (Choose one depending on your rim and preference):**

- **Schrader valve** (car valve): Common on mountain bikes and wider rims
- **Presta valve** (narrower, high-pressure): Common on road bikes or higher-end MTB rims

### **Recommended Tube Example (any brand):**

- **26 x 1.75–2.125 Schrader valve inner tube** – if you use standard MTB rims
- **26 x 1.75–2.125 Presta valve inner tube** – if your rim has a smaller valve hole
