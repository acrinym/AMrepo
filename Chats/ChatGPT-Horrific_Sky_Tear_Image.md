# Horrific Sky Tear Image

#### You:
Create for me an image of a horrific tear in the sky, like the heavens are ripping apart. Nothing inside the hole but void, the edges should be firey like it's reaching through helll itself. This should not be a pretty picture, but representational of the worst hurt a human can ever go through multiplied by a million.

#### ChatGPT:
Here is your image—if you want a version with even more intensity or specific elements, let me know.


#### You:
Add lava pools around the edges and water seeping into the cracks, and the edges should look as if lava/water is dropping into the void all over the image

Let me know if you want a higher resolution or another variation with specific changes!


#### You:
And how about the edges of it look like they're enscribed with a bible verse stating that the heavens were opened and all else was destroyed - make it biblical looking and have quote marks, etc. 

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely—here’s how I’ll handle this for you:

### Artistic Directions for the New Image

- The fiery, torn edges of the rift should be **etched or inscribed with an ancient-looking biblical verse**.

- The style of the text should look like glowing script, possibly in an old Hebrew, Greek, or classic English calligraphy.

- The verse (you can edit wording, but here’s a strong version):
  > “And the heavens were opened, and all else was destroyed.”\
  > Add quote marks. If you want a specific Bible translation or verse, just say so.

- The verse should **follow the shape of the fiery tear**, as if burned or glowing into the torn rim.

- The rest of the art remains as before: rift, void, lava/water flowing, apocalyptic atmosphere.

- Make the text look like an ancient prophecy—ornate, glowing, weathered at the edges.

#### Unless you want an *actual* Bible verse (like from Genesis, Revelation, or Ezekiel), I’ll use the above poetic phrasing.

**Confirm the text you want on the rift edge, or edit the phrase.**\
Once confirmed, I’ll generate and deliver the new image with the inscribed biblical quote effect.


#### You:
Well, can you make something more conspicuous that "god" might say? It's "quoting" him". 

#### ChatGPT:
Hell yes, I can. Let’s make it sound unmistakably “God-voice,” epic, and almost terrifying, like a divine decree—**not some soft poetic line, but a thunderous, apocalyptic statement**.

Here’s a strong candidate, echoing Old Testament wrath and majesty:

### Suggested Text (to be inscribed around the rift):

> **“Behold, I have torn the heavens asunder, and all beneath shall perish by My decree.”**\
> — GOD

- All-caps “GOD” for dramatic biblical weight.
- Add glowing, rune-like, ancient style to the quote, circling the tear.

If you want it *even heavier* (or if you want more fire/brimstone, or direct “I AM THE LORD” language), here’s a variant:

> **“By My hand the heavens are torn, and upon the earth I unleash desolation. I AM THE LORD.”**

Or:

> **“I open the sky, and all the world is cast into ruin, for I alone am God.”**

**Pick your favorite, mix lines, or tell me if you want a real biblical verse paraphrased with thunder and doom.\
Just say the word, and I’ll get your quote emblazoned on the rift’s edge.**

Which should I use? Or give me your own!


#### You:
Eh, maybe "and the heavens spoke and HE said" Behold, I tear asunder all things, nothing shall stay upright, I will unmake all things. 

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely—now **that** is biblical, ominous, and unmistakably “God-voice.”\
Here’s your chosen inscription, formatted for maximum drama:

### To Be Etched Around the Rift:

> **“And the heavens spoke, and HE said:\
> ‘Behold, I tear asunder all things.\
> Nothing shall stay upright;\
> I will unmake all things.’”**

---

#### Artistic Instructions

- The quote should **wrap around and through the torn, fiery, lava-dripping rift**, glowing as if etched by divine fire.
- Make “HE” and the first word of each line especially ornate or fiery.
- Use ancient or runic, illuminated script for a biblical/apocalyptic vibe.
- Place quote marks and a clear colon after “HE said”.
