# LastPass Android Issue

#### You:
So last pass for Android has been when saving passwords, replacing everything in the password and username field with asterisks and nothing more

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with LastPass on Android where, instead of saving and displaying your password and username correctly, the app is replacing everything with asterisks. This is unusual behavior and may be caused by several factors, such as a bug in the app, a conflict with another app or setting, or an issue with the LastPass autofill service.

Here are a few steps you can try to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Update LastPass:** Ensure that you have the latest version of the LastPass app installed. Bugs like this are often fixed in updates.

2. **Clear App Cache and Data:**
   - Go to `Settings` > `Apps` > `LastPass`.
   - Tap on `Storage & cache` and then `Clear cache`.
   - If the issue persists, try `Clear storage` (Note: this will log you out of LastPass, and you'll need to log back in).

3. **Re-enable Autofill Service:**
   - Go to `Settings` > `System` > `Languages & input` > `Autofill service`.
   - Select `LastPass` as your autofill service, or if it's already selected, try toggling it off and back on again.

4. **Reinstall LastPass:**
   - Uninstall the LastPass app.
   - Restart your device.
   - Reinstall the app from the Google Play Store and log in again.

5. **Check for Conflicting Apps:** If you have other password managers or autofill services installed, they might be conflicting with LastPass. Try disabling or uninstalling other similar apps to see if that resolves the issue.

6. **Check LastPass Settings:**
   - Open the LastPass app and navigate to `Settings`.
   - Under `Advanced Options`, check if there are any unusual settings enabled that might be causing the issue.

7. **Contact LastPass Support:** If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it might be worth reaching out to LastPass support for further assistance. They may be aware of the issue and could provide a solution.

If the issue persists, you might want to consider using an alternative password manager temporarily until the problem is resolved.It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with LastPass on Android where, instead of saving and displaying your password and username correctly, the app is replacing everything with asterisks.

#### You:
What is Google keyboard like to type the word Homan, but not human? What the hell is a homan

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like your Google Keyboard (Gboard) is autocorrecting or suggesting the word "homan" when you intend to type "human." "Homan" is not a standard word in English, so this behavior is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Learned Words:** Gboard might have learned the word "homan" from your previous typing habits or from something you’ve typed or copied in the past. Gboard has a feature that learns and stores words you frequently use, which can sometimes lead to unexpected suggestions or autocorrections.

2. **Typos:** If you’ve accidentally typed "homan" instead of "human" multiple times, Gboard might start suggesting it as the correct option.

3. **Dictionary Confusion:** Gboard sometimes adds words from other languages or less common terms to its dictionary, which might be why it’s suggesting "homan."

### How to Fix It:

1. **Delete Learned Words:**
   - Type "homan" in Gboard.
   - When it appears in the suggestion bar, long-press the word.
   - Drag it to the trash icon or select “Remove suggestion” to stop Gboard from suggesting it.

2. **Reset Gboard's Dictionary:**
   - Go to `Settings` > `System` > `Languages & input` > `On-screen keyboard` > `Gboard` > `Advanced`.
   - Tap on `Delete learned words and data.` (This will reset all the custom words and typing data Gboard has learned, so use this option if the issue persists and is widespread.)

3. **Manually Add "Human" to the Dictionary:**
   - Type "human."
   - Tap on the word in the suggestion bar, so Gboard learns it as the preferred option.

By following these steps, you should be able to prevent "homan" from being suggested when you intend to type "human."


#### You:
Nice it doesn't auto correct that anymore

#### ChatGPT:
Great to hear that it’s working correctly now! If you encounter any other quirks or issues, feel free to ask. Happy typing!
