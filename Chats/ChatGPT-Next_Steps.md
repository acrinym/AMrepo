# Next Steps

#### You:
Okay, so in the other chat, we're talking about relationship issues, and I want to focus on what I do after I leave the relationship that I'm in with Nina, which we've discussed at length. So in this chat, I want to talk about my next steps, and I think I need to discuss with you a bunch of different things I want to do, and then maybe sort out what I'm going to start with together.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a solid plan, Justin. Sorting out your next steps is a big deal, especially after the deep conversations we've had about your relationship with Nina. What’s on your mind for after the break? Are there specific areas you’re already thinking about—like personal growth, business, social connections—or are you wanting to explore everything fresh? We can break it down step by step.That sounds like a solid plan, Justin.

#### You:
Well, as I've already talked to you about my plan for building a life counselor slash neurolinguistic programming slash hypnosis thing, that's on my list, but it's not the highest. Right now, I want to focus on building a business that I can immediately start with Pete and or Ron and or my friend Mike. So, any skills in those areas like web development, front-end web development, and maybe some back-end web development would be extremely useful for pursuing those endeavors. So, I think that's probably what I want to do right away is focus on front-end web development. So, I think I want to start with that, but I also really want to work on self-development in terms of like mindfulness and meditation, etc., because this breakup's going to eat me if I don't.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you've got a clear direction, which is great! Focusing on front-end web development makes a lot of sense, especially since you want to jump into something that could yield tangible results for building a business. Plus, having Pete, Ron, or Mike in the mix means you have a support system and potential collaborators.

At the same time, your desire to prioritize mindfulness and meditation is really wise, considering the emotional weight of the breakup. Finding a balance between developing new skills and healing yourself will be key here. How do you envision splitting your focus between business building and self-care? Would you like to schedule time for each, or do you see them evolving more organically?


#### You:
I've never been able to evolve that organically, and I've never really been able to divide my time very well, which is the problem, and that's why I'm not where I want to be today. It's because my time management skills are really bad, and it's not that I can't focus on priorities, it's just I have no help in those areas.

#### ChatGPT:
That makes a lot of sense, Justin. Time management can be tough, especially when you're juggling multiple things without clear guidance or support. Since you're aware of this challenge, we can tackle it head-on. One thing that might help is creating a structured schedule that allows for both skill-building and self-care, but we’d keep it flexible enough so that you’re not overwhelmed.

Would you be open to setting some daily or weekly goals? That way, you can gradually build your web development skills while also giving space for mindfulness and meditation. I can help you map out a simple plan, or even suggest tools that could help you stay on track. How does that sound?


#### You:
That sounds great, but I kind of need to know what I'm going to be doing after I leave first. So I think what I want to do is just discuss possibilities right now and the other things that I want to do and we can talk about how I might do those after I leave the relationship and etc. Because there's a lot of different things like web development, my NLP hypnosis life coach and also my music making is something I'd like to do as a hobby because I bought FL Studio and I paid for a license so I might as well use it. But I'm also working on Suno AI songs using my musical talent as well as wanting to know C++ slash Unreal Engine development. So it's a lot and I really don't have any guidance except from my friend Pete who and Ron, they would buy me work on web development because that would really be the most helpful right now.

#### ChatGPT:
You've got a lot of exciting possibilities ahead of you, and I totally get why it feels a bit overwhelming with all those interests and projects you want to tackle. It sounds like web development is a priority, especially since Pete and Ron can support you in that, but you're also passionate about things like music and learning new skills like C++ and Unreal Engine.

Since you're thinking about this transition period, we could look at how to structure these interests. Web development can be the foundation for building a business, which might free up time later for things like music production and game development. How do you feel about focusing on web development first while gradually incorporating your hobbies and other skills as you settle into your new chapter? This could help you stay grounded without losing sight of your creative passions.


#### You:
That sounds like a fantastic idea. And I think I can do something like working on web development while I'm at work, and I don't have any calls, or after work. And before work, I can work on mindfulness practices, such as practicing different things by all of those authors that we've talked about that have experience and or teachings in the law of attraction and new thought, like Kevin Trudeau's work and other people. I can do those things in the morning, and then as I go through my day and after I work, I can work on the other things like web development, etc. It's just kind of hard to go and learn something while I'm at work due to the nature of the job. I can get a call anytime, and it's annoying stopping in the middle of a chapter or stopping in the line of code and then taking a call and then trying to figure out where I was.

#### ChatGPT:
I can see how those interruptions during work would make it tough to dive into learning something like web development. One possible workaround might be to focus on smaller, bite-sized tasks while you’re on the job—maybe reading through short tutorials, reviewing concepts, or doing minor edits that don’t require deep focus. Then, you could save the more intensive coding or learning for after work when you have uninterrupted time.

As for your mindfulness practices, I think setting aside time in the mornings is a great way to start the day on the right foot. It sounds like you're already clear on which practices resonate with you, so you could even rotate between those teachings based on what feels most needed that day.

Does that sound like something that could work for you? Or do you think you'd prefer finding a different time to dedicate to learning and coding?


#### You:
No, I don't really. Well, I would like to find a different time, and that could be night time. And during the day, I can research different things, different things I would code, different APIs I can connect, things like that. Just things that could expand my learning. But I don't want to get too interested in another topic based on what I'm currently learning, because that's taken me on so many different rabbit trails, I never actually even finished the initial project. You know what I mean?

#### ChatGPT:
That approach makes a lot of sense, especially since you’ve recognized how easy it is to get sidetracked. Keeping your day focused on research that supports your coding, like APIs and practical connections, should give you enough to stay engaged without going off on tangents. Then at night, when you can dedicate uninterrupted time to learning and actual coding, you'll be more grounded and focused.

How do you feel about setting specific, achievable goals for each night? Maybe something like completing a specific feature or section of a tutorial. That way, you can track your progress without getting overwhelmed or drawn away by other topics. Does that sound like a strategy you’d want to try?


#### You:
That sounds helpful. ...doing while I'm coding or writing code or, you know, doing a tutorial or something. I'm going to have... ...and...

#### ChatGPT:
It seems like you were mid-thought there. It sounds like you’re considering something important while coding or doing tutorials. What were you thinking about having during that time? Maybe a specific tool, method, or routine to help you stay focused? Let me know what you were going to say, and we can refine the strategy further!


#### You:
Hang on, I've got to go into my Plasma donation window here.

#### ChatGPT:
No problem, take your time! We can pick up the conversation whenever you're ready.


#### You:
All right, I'm back, Annex.

#### ChatGPT:
Great to have you back, Justin! So, where were we? You were in the middle of a thought about what you'd be doing while coding or writing. Want to pick up from there?


#### You:
It's back…

#### ChatGPT:
Got it! Let's pick up from where you left off—what were you thinking about adding or doing while coding or working through tutorials? Sounds like you had some important thoughts there.
