# Fish Grammar Song Madness

#### You:
I'd like an entire song with four verses and two Bridges and an intro and an outro containing the word fish and various grammar and grammatical interesting things. So you can change the words however you want as long as they still say fish, and you can add as much punctuation as you want to make it silly but still readable by an ai.

### **"Fishin' for Words"**

#### **Intro:**

Fiiish, f!sh, fi—shhh, oh,\
🐟 Where’d the *fish* in fishing go?\
Flippin’, floppin’, punctuation’s poppin’—\
Let’s see where this **f!$h** boat’s stoppin’!

---

#### **Verse 1:**

Fish? Fisshh—F!sh?? What’s the *issue*?\
Grammarly gasps at my aquatic misuse!\
Fisssshhh... or fishezz? Too many esses?\
Oxford’s weeping—so are the presses!

#### **Verse 2:**

Fish’ish, fish-ish—*suspicious*!\
Slippery syntax, not too judicious.\
Did I pluralize? Maybe I *fished*—\
Grammar police? Whoops! I *wish*-ed.

---

#### **Bridge 1:**

Ohhh, **comma-fish** (pause...) swimmin’ in the sea,\
Parenthetical (fish) keep sneakin’ up on me!\
Ellipsis... sinking... no more bait—\
“Quotations” trap them? No, too late!

---

#### **Verse 3:**

Fissshhh!—hyphen? No—f!sh, with a dash.\
Apostro-fish’s got too much sass!\
Should I italicize **fisH** for flair?\
Or ALL CAPS FISH? *Too much glare!*

#### **Verse 4:**

Fish’d, fishin’, f!$h’n—contractual fate?\
What if I conjugate? (Fish? Fash? Foshed? Fote?)\
Predicate’s flipping, subject’s lost—\
Syntax overboard, *grammar's tossed!*

---

#### **Bridge 2:**

Asterisk-fish (*twinkle*)—dancing in the text,\
Ampersand-fish (&) got context perplexed.\
Backslash\fish\ just swam away,\
Oh, tilde~~fish~~ makes waves all day!

---

#### **Outro:**

F!sh, f1sh, fi\_sh, fin’ished!\
Caught in a net of rules diminished.\
Spellcheck sighs, AI’s amused—\
The **fishiest** song—syntax **confused!** 🎣

---

Want me to add a melody suggestion or keep it as pure lyrical madness?### **"Fishin' for Words"**

**"Woolly Whispers: The Mammoth's Return"**

*Verse 1:*
In labs where ancient shadows loom,
Scientists weave from nature's loom.
With genes revived from icy tomb,
The mammoth stirs amidst the gloom.

*Chorus:*
Woolly whispers in the night,
Genomes dancing in the light.
From epochs past, they take their flight,
Mammoths marching to our sight.

*Verse 2:*
Through CRISPR's touch and careful hand,
They conjure beasts to walk the land.
Ethics murmur, questions stand,
Yet progress strides where dreams are planned.

*Chorus:*
Woolly whispers in the night,
Genomes dancing in the light.
From epochs past, they take their flight,
Mammoths marching to our sight.

*Bridge:*
Tundras cold and forests deep,
Echoes of the past now seep.
In our hands, the secrets keep,
Awakening giants from their sleep.

*Verse 3:*
With woolly coats and tusks of might,
They roam again, a wondrous sight.
A testament to human plight,
To rewrite nature's ancient rite.

*Chorus:*
Woolly whispers in the night,
Genomes dancing in the light.
From epochs past, they take their flight,
Mammoths marching to our sight.

*Outro:*
As dawn breaks o'er the frozen plain,
Mammoths graze where they were slain.
A fusion of the old and new,
In their reflection, we see it too.

Also, make sure that the song is written in childish language instead of the verbatim
