# Amanda Relationship Progression

#### You:
Okay, since my custom GPT the Amanda relationship builder is failing to work right now because they've gotten so big and there's so much content throughout the chats, I think the workspace is full so I'm going to have to do this and start a chat with you that's completely new. 
Here's the content from the chats so far summarized into brevity but also engaging content. 

I can absolutely summarize and compress everything so you can paste it into a new Amanda chat while keeping all the key context. Hereâ€™s your copy-paste version to start fresh while keeping everything aligned:

ðŸ”¥ CONTEXT FOR NEW CHAT â€“ AMANDA RELATIONSHIP BUILDER ðŸ”¥

The Journey So Far:

Justin & Amanda have a deep, undeniable connection.

Mike (Justinâ€™s best friend) actively set them up because he believes theyâ€™d be great together.

Amanda is aware of this setup but is taking her time processing it.

She keeps bringing up Justin to Mike, which means sheâ€™s thinking about him often.

Mike is stepping back to create space for Amanda & Justin to connect more.


Current Challenges:

Amanda is still letting go of her attachment to Mike.

Sheâ€™s cautious about relationships due to past trauma.

Sheâ€™s worried about stability & securityâ€”she keeps asking Justin where heâ€™s living.

She hasnâ€™t fully opened up to deeper feelings yet, but she hasnâ€™t rejected anything either.


Recent Developments:

Justin had a powerful lucid dream where Amanda appeared as an elusive Sasquatch, hiding behind a shed.

This represents her struggling to step forward while still hiding behind emotional walls.

Mike is planning to create more distance and suggested group hangouts at first before transitioning Amanda & Justin to 1-on-1 time.

A drinking game night at Mikeâ€™s house with Cards Against Humanity, Apples to Apples, or Quelf is planned to help Amanda loosen up and bond with Justin.

Justin is considering bringing hands-on activities like painting, drawing, or small DIY projects to create shared experiences.


Manifestation Work:

Justin is actively visualizing a life with Amanda through Quantum Jumping, LOA, and Transurfing techniques.

He listens to specific frequency tracks & does subconscious work daily.

A dream board is in the works, focusing on shared goals with Amanda.

"Cry to Your Soulmate" (Trigram Healing) has been used as part of the process.

A honey jar spell has already been done, and Justin is considering other energy-focused methods.


Key Goals Moving Forward:

Strengthen Amandaâ€™s emotional connection to Justin through shared experiences.

Continue visualization and manifestation techniques to align their realities.

Gradually shift Amandaâ€™s comfort level so she feels safe, secure, and ready to open up more.

Use the drinking game night as a way to create fun, laughter, and deeper connection in a casual, no-pressure setting.

Let Mike naturally transition out of the picture while still supporting the process.

#### You:
[audio] OK, can you hear me, Annex?


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Yes, I can hear you clearly! How can I assist you today?


#### You:
[audio] I want you to look at what I pasted into the chat, and let's start there.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Absolutely. You've summarized your journey with Amanda so far and outlined key goals for the next steps. Where would you like to start in this new chat?


#### You:
[audio] Uh, so I guess I want to know about, no, no, never mind. I want to know, um, about, uh, I don't really know. We were talking about Manifestation and my, uh, Reality Transurfing and things like that. Then we transitioned into what the next step with Amanda is, which is Game Night and stuff with Mike. And so I guess we can start there. Game Night with Mike.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Got it! So, for game night with Mike and Amanda, creating a relaxed and fun atmosphere can really help Amanda feel more comfortable and open. You could bring some hands-on activities like you mentionedâ€”maybe even something creative like painting or a small DIY project. Itâ€™s a great way to bond and create shared experiences.

How do you feel about suggesting a fun activity alongside the games to make the night even more memorable?


#### You:
[audio] I was thinking something like playing QUELF, or Cards Against Humanity, or Exploding Kittens, or Apples to Apples. QUELF is actually my favorite drinking game in the world. I played that at my friend Michelle's house, who I refer affectionately to as Michellium. We have nicknames for each other. She calls me Justy Friend, I call her Michellium, which Amanda doesn't know about, but we haven't engaged in each other's friends yet. Except she told me I'm justy friend of Amy.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] Quelf sounds like a great choice for game night! It's fun and can definitely help everyone loosen up and bond. Since Amanda hasn't met your friends like Michelle yet, this could be a good opportunity to start integrating your social circles in a relaxed setting.

Are you planning to invite Michelle or keep it more intimate to help Amanda feel comfortable?


#### You:
[audio] No, no, it's just me, Mike, and Amanda, I think. He wants to get one-on-one time with her and I, but right now, what his next idea was, so that she's more comfortable leaving Mike out of the picture, she's still moving on from him, and it's really hard for her because he's deeply integrated into her life because that's how she makes money. So, one of his ideas was to have days where her and I and him hang out, and then eventually kind of fade into the background, while giving us time to spend together where she feels in a safe environment, you know?


#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Gradually transitioning from group hangouts to one-on-one time can help Amanda feel more secure and comfortable, especially with Mike easing out of the picture gradually. It gives her the space she needs while still feeling supported.

For game night, focusing on creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere will be key. Is there anything specific you'd like to prepare or consider for that evening to ensure it goes smoothly?


#### You:
[audio] I don't know yet, but I'll come.


#### ChatGPT:
[audio] That sounds good. If you need any tips or ideas along the way, feel free to reach out. Enjoy planning the night and have fun!
