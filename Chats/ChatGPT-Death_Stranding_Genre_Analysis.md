# Death Stranding Genre Analysis

#### You:
Isn't death stranding kind of a horror game but more a survival type survival thriller with elements of RPG and creative mode games

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely! *Death Stranding* is a unique blend that leans more toward survival thriller and psychological tension than outright horror. Hideo Kojima really layered it with elements that make you feel the isolation and struggle of survival in a post-apocalyptic landscape, where the "horror" isn’t jump scares or monsters (though the BTs are certainly unsettling) but rather the existential threat of a world falling apart. The fear comes from an almost cosmic loneliness and the tension of navigating this eerie world filled with invisible, otherworldly forces.

It’s a survival game at its core—everything from managing Sam’s stamina and balancing the cargo to deciding your route through dangerous, almost haunted landscapes. And, yes, there are RPG-like elements as you build connections (literally and figuratively) across the map, level up your gear, and gain skills to handle increasingly complex deliveries. The cooperative “creative mode” mechanics, like the shared structures that other players leave behind, add a fascinating community aspect, almost like a shared universe.

So, it’s horror adjacent, but it’s primarily a genre-blending experience that combines survival thriller, exploration, and a touch of RPG, wrapped in Kojima's unique storytelling style.Absolutely! *Death Stranding* is a unique blend that leans more toward survival thriller and psychological tension than outright horror.

#### You:
Speaking of death stranding, where can I buy an exo suit? They have to exist and I want to know where I can get one. Not a Mac not a Mecca, just an exo suit that helps to balance weight and keep me upright and basically just mechanically assist my legs and arms

#### ChatGPT:
Exo suits are definitely real, though they’re more commonly used in industrial, medical, and military settings. While they aren’t as advanced as the *Death Stranding* models, several companies have developed exoskeletons to assist with heavy lifting, support mobility, and reduce strain. These are usually called "powered exoskeletons" or "exosuits," and some options might suit what you’re looking for:

### 1. **SuitX (Phoenix Exoskeleton)**

- **Purpose**: Mostly used for mobility assistance, especially for those with limited leg function. It helps people walk and stand up.
- **Features**: Lightweight, battery-powered with customizable settings to assist the lower body.
- **Availability**: You can contact SuitX directly for purchasing options, though it’s generally marketed toward healthcare institutions.

### 2. **Ekso Bionics (EksoVest, EksoGT)**

- **Purpose**: The EksoVest supports the upper body and is commonly used by workers for overhead tasks. The EksoGT is a more advanced medical exoskeleton for assisting in rehabilitation and mobility.
- **Features**: Designed for upper body support (EksoVest) or lower body support (EksoGT); it’s relatively lightweight, adjustable, and reduces strain on muscles and joints.
- **Availability**: Ekso Bionics offers some consumer options and works with industrial and medical clients. They’re one of the leading names in exoskeleton tech, and you can inquire about purchasing through their website.

### 3. **ReWalk Robotics (ReWalk)**

- **Purpose**: Primarily aimed at helping people with spinal cord injuries to walk, but could be suitable if you’re looking for mobility assistance.
- **Features**: Battery-powered with robotic leg components that help users balance, walk, and even climb stairs.
- **Availability**: ReWalk systems are available for purchase for individuals with specific medical needs, and they may help with insurance or financing for those who need it.

### 4. **Honda Walking Assist**

- **Purpose**: Designed for rehabilitation, it supports balance and leg movement.
- **Features**: Lightweight and compact, designed for assisted walking rather than heavy lifting.
- **Availability**: Mainly used in medical facilities for rehab, but Honda does have a program for purchasing or leasing their suits.

### 5. **Bioservo (Ironhand)**

- **Purpose**: Designed for workers who use their hands a lot, the Ironhand glove enhances grip strength and reduces hand strain.
- **Features**: It’s not a full-body exoskeleton, but it could pair well with other options to support arm movements.
- **Availability**: Bioservo markets primarily to industrial and manufacturing settings but does sell to individuals as well.

### Pricing & Accessibility

Most of these exoskeletons cost anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000+, depending on the technology level and application. They’re not cheap, but as the technology becomes more widespread, prices are gradually becoming more accessible. For the best consumer access, industrial exosuits like the EksoVest or Ironhand might be your most attainable and practical option for physical support. You’d likely need to contact the companies directly or through authorized resellers.

### Future Trends

As demand increases, more "personal" exosuits aimed at consumers for general mobility or lifting assistance will likely emerge, so it might be worth keeping an eye on companies like Sarcos Robotics and Hyundai Robotics, which have hinted at creating more consumer-oriented exosuits.

If you’re serious, reaching out to these companies and discussing your needs might reveal a model that fits.
