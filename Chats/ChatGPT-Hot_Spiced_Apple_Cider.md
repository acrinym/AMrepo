### Ingredients:

- **1 gallon (4 liters) apple cider** (unfiltered is best for a rich flavor)
- **2-3 cinnamon sticks**
- **1-2 teaspoons whole cloves**
- **1-2 teaspoons whole allspice**
- **1-2 star anise** (optional, for a subtle licorice flavor)
- **1 orange** (sliced into rounds; optional for added citrus flavor)
- **1/4 cup brown sugar or honey** (optional, adjust to taste)
- **1/2 teaspoon nutmeg** (ground or whole)
- **Optional garnishes**: apple slices, cinnamon sticks, or whipped cream

---

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the spices:**
   - Place the whole cloves, allspice, and star anise in a small piece of cheesecloth or a tea infuser for easy removal later. Alternatively, you can leave them loose and strain the cider before serving.

2. **Combine ingredients:**
   - In a large pot, pour in the apple cider.
   - Add the cinnamon sticks, orange slices, nutmeg, and the prepared spice bundle (if using cheesecloth).

3. **Sweeten (optional):**
   - Stir in brown sugar or honey if you prefer a sweeter cider.

4. **Heat the cider:**
   - Place the pot over medium heat and bring the cider to a gentle simmer. Do not boil, as boiling can diminish the flavor.

5. **Simmer and infuse:**
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the cider simmer gently for 20-30 minutes to allow the spices to infuse. Stir occasionally.

6. **Strain (if needed):**
   - If you added the spices loose, strain the cider through a fine mesh sieve to remove solids.

7. **Serve:**
   - Ladle the hot cider into mugs and garnish with apple slices, a cinnamon stick, or whipped cream if desired.
