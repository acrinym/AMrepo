Here’s how to get **Advanced Voice Mode (AVM)** back up and running in your ChatGPT Android app:

---

## 🛠️ 1. Check app version & updates

Make sure you're on **ChatGPT version 1.2024.206** or later (Android requirement for AVM) citeturn0search6.

- Go to **Google Play Store → My apps → Update ChatGPT**
- If already up-to-date, proceed below.

## 🎙️ 2. Grant necessary permissions

AVM needs **microphone permission** on Android citeturn0search0.

- Navigate to **Settings → Apps → ChatGPT → Permissions**
- Ensure **Microphone** is allowed.

---

## 3. Enable AVM in Settings

To toggle off/on AVM:

- Open ChatGPT → tap the **Profile icon** (top‑right) → **Personalization** → **Custom Instructions** → **Advanced** → switch **Advanced Voice** on/off citeturn0search6.
- If it was off, turn **on**, then close app, reopen, and long‑press mic icon in chat to restart by AVM.

## 4. Relaunch the app

Sometimes AVM only appears after a complete restart citeturn0search1.\
Typical steps:

1. **Force‑quit** the app.
2. Reopen ChatGPT.
3. The **blue AVM orb** should appear when tapping the mic citeturn0search0turn0search6.

## ⏳ 5. Rollout delays & account type

AVM is rolling out gradually to **Paid plans (Plus, Pro, Team)**.\
Free users get **daily preview of 4o‑mini** only citeturn0search0turn0search6.\
If you're on a paid plan and still don’t see it after the above steps, it’s likely still being enabled for your account—just a matter of time.
