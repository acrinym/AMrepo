The radiator drain plug on a 2016 Chevy Sonic is usually located at the bottom of the radiator. Here’s how you can locate it:

1. **Get Under the Car**: Safely lift and support the front of your car using jack stands if necessary to get a better view and access underneath the radiator.

2. **Locate the Bottom of the Radiator**: The drain plug is generally at the bottom edge of the radiator, often on the driver's side or passenger's side corner.

#### You:
I need some more detailed instructions on the drain plug. Where is it on the radiator? Just at the bottom doesn't really help because I didn't see it there.

#### ChatGPT:
I understand. Let's go into more detail.

1. **Locate the Radiator**: First, make sure you're looking at the radiator itself, which is positioned at the front of the engine bay.

2. **Find the Drain Plug**: On a 2016 Chevy Sonic, the radiator drain plug is usually located on the passenger side of the radiator, towards the bottom.

3. **Exact Location**: The drain plug is typically found on the back side of the radiator, facing the engine. You'll need to look closely at the lower section, slightly towards the center but more to the passenger side.

4. **Appearance**: The drain plug is often a small, black or dark-colored plastic screw or knob that can be turned by hand or with a wrench. It might be recessed slightly into the radiator.

If you're still unable to locate it, it's possible that it might be obscured by other components or debris, so a flashlight could help. Additionally, removing any splash shields or protective covers in the area might give you a better view. If you have a repair manual for the 2016 Chevy Sonic, it should have a diagram showing the exact location.
