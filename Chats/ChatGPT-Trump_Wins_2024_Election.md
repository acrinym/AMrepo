#### You:
Yep. Anyway, industranding I'm in the central region and trying to find a new truck that I can use without having gotten the fabrication for vehicles yet. So I've stolen two mule trucks and one of them died because it ran out of durability so I just left it in a mule camp and the other one I got stuck on a rock in the water and I can't figure out how to get it out if there's even a way. A third option is finding another mule truck but I don't know where to find that

#### ChatGPT:
In *Death Stranding*, it sounds like you're having quite the adventure with those Mule trucks! Here are a few tips that might help you get back on track:

1. **Rescue the Stuck Truck**: Sometimes, you can free a stuck vehicle by pushing it with your character (Sam) if it’s just wedged lightly. Try moving around it and pushing against it from different angles to see if you can nudge it free. If it’s truly stuck on a rock or in water, though, it might be a lost cause.

2. **Finding Another Mule Truck**: Mule camps are usually your best bet for finding more trucks. If you’re in the Central Region, some of the denser Mule camps, like the ones around the Timefall Farm and Lake Knot City, often have vehicles you can "borrow." Mules will respawn after a while, so if you revisit a previously cleared camp, you may find a new truck there.

3. **Increase Truck Durability**: Mule trucks, being scavenged and not as durable as the ones you can fabricate, will deteriorate faster. If you find yourself in a truck with low durability, try to avoid Timefall or park it in sheltered areas whenever possible.

4. **Long-Term Strategy – Fabricate Your Own Truck**: Once you unlock fabrication at certain facilities, you can build your own trucks, which tend to be more reliable and customizable. In the meantime, stick with scavenging until you gain access to vehicle fabrication through mission progress.

If all else fails, sometimes it’s easiest just to hoof it on foot to a new Mule camp. Hopefully, you’ll be able to find a fresh truck or even build your own soon. Happy deliveries!


#### You:
Is there any way to restore the durability of mule trucks

#### ChatGPT:
Unfortunately, there’s no direct way to restore the durability of a stolen Mule truck in *Death Stranding*. These trucks are not repairable, as they don’t get the benefit of auto-repair or Timefall Shelters like the vehicles you fabricate yourself. However, there are a couple of things you can do to prolong its lifespan or work around the durability issue:

1. **Avoid Timefall Exposure**: Timefall (the special rain that rapidly deteriorates materials) is one of the main factors that reduce vehicle durability. Parking the truck under natural cover, like bridges or cliffs, or taking shelter in caves can protect it from rain. The longer you keep the truck out of Timefall, the slower it will deteriorate.

2. **Find Sheltered Parking Areas**: If you’re near a Mule camp or any structure that offers a covered area, try to park the truck under there whenever you’re stopping. Even if the durability is dropping slowly, this will help keep it going a bit longer.

3. **Plan Short-Term Use**: Since these trucks aren’t repairable, consider using them only for shorter trips or single delivery runs where you can ditch it once it’s low on durability. This is a good strategy if you’re just using Mule trucks temporarily.

4. **Fabricate Your Own Truck as Soon as Possible**: Once you unlock the ability to fabricate your own vehicles at distribution centers, you’ll have access to more durable vehicles that can be repaired in garages and protected from Timefall damage when stored. This becomes a huge quality-of-life upgrade.

In the meantime, you might need to keep scouring Mule camps or rely on your own two feet until you unlock fabrication options. Hang in there; once you have access to reliable vehicles, your deliveries will be much smoother!


#### You:
When do I get to fabricate vehicles? Is that through the Craftsman or the engineer doing deliveries

#### ChatGPT:
You’ll be able to fabricate your own vehicles once you connect certain facilities to the Chiral Network and increase your connection level with specific NPCs. Here’s the general breakdown:

1. **Unlock the Distribution Center South of Lake Knot City**: Once you reach the Central Region and connect this center to the Chiral Network, you’ll be able to fabricate vehicles at that location. This usually happens a bit into Chapter 3, as you progress through the story missions.

2. **Complete Key Deliveries**: As you continue to make deliveries to the Craftsman, Engineer, and other key NPCs, they’ll start providing you with new gear and vehicle blueprints. For instance:
   - **The Engineer** and **The Craftsman** are important for unlocking gear upgrades and exoskeletons that can help with weight and stability, but they don’t directly give you vehicle fabrication.
   - **Story Progress**: Fabrication of vehicles comes primarily through advancing the main storyline rather than optional deliveries, so keep progressing through the main quests in Chapter 3 to unlock it at the Distribution Center.

3. **First Fabricatable Vehicle – Reverse Trike**: Initially, you’ll be able to fabricate the **Reverse Trike**. It’s not a truck, but it’s very versatile for navigating rough terrain and making quicker deliveries. Trucks become available for fabrication later on as you progress.

So, continue progressing through the main story, especially the missions that involve connecting large hubs and distribution centers. It won’t be long until you can fabricate your own vehicles, and they’re much more durable and reliable than the ones scavenged from Mule camps!


#### You:
Darn it so I have to get the server back first from the mule camp

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, exactly! You’ll need to retrieve the **Chiral Network Server** from the Mule camp as part of the main mission. This will allow you to connect the Distribution Center South of Lake Knot City to the Chiral Network, which is the crucial step for unlocking vehicle fabrication. This retrieval mission can be a bit challenging, especially if the Mules are aggressive, but here are some tips to help you out:

1. **Prepare Tools and Gear**: Make sure you have some **Hematic Grenades**, **Smoke Grenades**, or **Bola Guns** to help neutralize the Mules without engaging in direct combat. The Bola Gun, in particular, is great for taking them down from a distance and is non-lethal.

2. **Stealth Approach**: Mules are most vulnerable if you sneak in and avoid detection. Try going in at night (if possible) or look for ways to approach from behind cover. Take advantage of tall grass or rocky outcroppings to avoid Mule sensors.

3. **Plan an Escape Route**: Once you’ve grabbed the server, it’s a good idea to have a route planned to get out of the camp quickly. If you can, grab a Mule truck (if they have one available), which could help make a speedy exit.

4. **Head Straight to the Distribution Center**: After retrieving the server, return directly to the Distribution Center South of Lake Knot City to complete the mission and connect the area to the Chiral Network. Once that’s done, you’ll gain access to fabricating essential equipment, including the Reverse Trike!

Once you’ve completed this mission, things get a lot easier, and you’ll have more options for transportation. Hang in there!
