**Song Title: "I Say a Lot of Things"**

*(Genre: Pop/Rock – can be adjusted to fit any style)*

---

**\[Verse 1: Lead Singer]**\
I wake up with a storm inside my head,\
Thoughts like lightning, words I’ve left unsaid.\
Paint the sky with colors you can’t see,\
A restless mind that never sets me free.

Echoes in the corners, whispers in the halls,\
Building up a story written on my walls.\
Truth and fiction dancing in between,\
A fragile thread stitched into every scene.

---

**\[Chorus: Lead Singer & Second Singer (Call & Response)]**\
**(Lead Singer):**\
I say a lot of things, louder than the rain,\
Words collide like thunder, tangled in the strain.\
Stories spun from shadows, echoes in the breeze—\
I say a lot of things, but do you hear me, please?

**(Second Singer):**\
*You say a lot of things, louder than the rain,*\
*Words collide like thunder, tangled in the strain.*\
*Stories spun from shadows, echoes in the breeze—*\
*You say a lot of things, but do you hear you, please?*

---

**\[Verse 2: Lead Singer]**\
Promises are paper boats, drifting down the stream,\
Folding into shapes of every broken dream.\
Questions with no answers, riddles with no key,\
Talking circles just to find some clarity.

I build bridges out of fragile words and thread,\
Cross them just to watch them crumble in my head.\
But maybe in the echoes, something true remains,\
A fragile pulse beneath the noise and names.

---

**\[Chorus: Lead Singer & Second Singer (Call & Response)]**\
**(Lead Singer):**\
I say a lot of things, louder than the rain,\
Words collide like thunder, tangled in the strain.\
Stories spun from shadows, echoes in the breeze—\
I say a lot of things, but do you hear me, please?

**(Second Singer):**\
*You say a lot of things, louder than the rain,*\
*Words collide like thunder, tangled in the strain.*\
*Stories spun from shadows, echoes in the breeze—*\
*You say a lot of things, but do you hear you, please?*

---

**\[Bridge: Both Singers (Harmony/Layered Vocals)]**\
Maybe it’s the silence we fear the most,\
So we fill the space with words like ghosts.\
But in the quiet, hearts confess—\
It’s not the words, it’s the emptiness.

---

**\[Chorus (Final): Lead Singer & Second Singer (Full Harmony)]**\
**(Together):**\
I say a lot of things, louder than the rain,\
Words collide like thunder, tangled in the strain.\
Stories spun from shadows, echoes in the breeze—\
I say a lot of things, but do you hear me, please?

**(Refrain/Outro - Second Singer softly fading):**\
*You say a lot of things…*\
*You say a lot of things…*\
*But do you hear you, please?*

*(Fading out with soft echoes of "I say a lot of things…")*

#### You:
No the entire song should only consist of those phrases. And include (yelling loudly), and lots of other song style edits inside parentheses like that

This version is raw, chaotic, and could work great with aggressive instrumentation or even as an experimental electronic track. Let me know if you'd like to tweak the structure or style!
