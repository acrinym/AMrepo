Can you create a resource automated mine in astroneer

#### ChatGPT:
Creating a resource automated mine in *Astroneer* involves setting up a system that can extract resources continuously with minimal manual intervention. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### 1. **Select the Mining Location**

- **Identify the Resource:** First, choose the resource you want to mine (e.g., compound, resin, astronium).
- **Find a Rich Node:** Locate an area where the resource is abundant. It’s essential to pick a spot with high resource density to maximize efficiency.

### 2. **Prepare the Area**

- **Clear the Area:** Flatten the terrain around your mining site to make it easier to place equipment and move around.
- **Create a Safe Environment:** If you're mining in hazardous areas (e.g., caves), ensure there’s enough light and that dangerous plants are cleared.

### 3. **Set Up the Drills**

- **Place an Auto Extractor:** This is the primary tool for automated mining. Position it on top of the resource deposit.
- **Power Supply:** Connect the Auto Extractor to a power source. Depending on your setup, this could be a large solar array, wind turbines, or a connected power grid from your base. For continuous operation, consider using batteries or RTGs (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators).
- **Alignment:** Ensure the Auto Extractor is correctly aligned with the resource deposit to maximize extraction efficiency.

### 4. **Set Up Storage and Logistics**

- **Place Medium or Large Resource Canisters:** Connect these to the Auto Extractor to store the mined resources. You can use Medium Storage units or larger if you're planning for long-term mining operations.
- **Use Auto Arms:** If you want to transport resources to a nearby base or refine them automatically, set up Auto Arms to transfer resources from the canisters to other containers or directly into a Refinery.
- **Tether to Base:** Use tethers or extend your base's cable system to provide constant power and connectivity to your automated mine.

### 5. **Automation Setup**

- **Automation Setup:** Use buttons, repeaters, and other automation modules to control the start and stop of your mining operation if necessary. This step is optional and is more for managing power or specific timings.
- **Monitoring:** Ensure that you occasionally check the setup to clear any obstructions or handle any power issues.

### 6. **Extend the Setup (Optional)**

- **Multiple Extractors:** For a large-scale operation, consider setting up multiple Auto Extractors in the same or different areas, all feeding into a centralized storage system.
- **Transportation Network:** Set up a rover with storage or use shuttles to transport resources back to your main base or other locations if the mine is far from your primary base.

### 7. **Maintenance**

- **Periodic Checks:** While the system is automated, occasionally check to ensure that everything runs smoothly, power levels are stable, and storage isn’t full.
- **Resource Extraction:** Once the deposit is depleted, move the extractor to a new location and repeat the process.

This setup should allow you to mine resources with minimal intervention efficiently. The key is balancing power supply and storage capacity, ensuring your system runs smoothly over time.Creating a resource automated mine in *Astroneer* involves setting up a system that can extract resources continuously with minimal manual intervention.
