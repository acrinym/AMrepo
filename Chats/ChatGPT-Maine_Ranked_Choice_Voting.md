# Maine Ranked Choice Voting

#### You:
Maine has ranked choice voting? What is? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, Maine uses ranked-choice voting (RCV), which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference (1st choice, 2nd choice, etc.) rather than selecting only one candidate. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initial Count**: All first-choice votes are counted. If a candidate receives more than 50% of these votes, they win outright.

2. **Elimination Rounds**: If no candidate wins a majority in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who selected the eliminated candidate as their first choice have their votes reallocated to their next preferred candidate.

3. **Repeating the Process**: This process continues, eliminating the lowest-ranked candidate and reallocating those votes, until one candidate secures a majority.

Ranked-choice voting is intended to ensure that the winning candidate has broad support and can sometimes reduce the impact of “spoiler” candidates by allowing voters to express multiple preferences. It’s been adopted in Maine to give voters a more nuanced way to express their choices, especially in elections with multiple candidates.Yes, Maine uses ranked-choice voting (RCV), which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference (1st choice, 2nd choice, etc.) rather than selecting only one candidate.
