# Eating Decorative Gourds Tips

#### You:
Can you eat decorative gourds and if you were to do so what would they even taste like and how would you prepare them

#### ChatGPT:
Decorative gourds, while technically edible, are not typically grown or cultivated for consumption. These gourds are often bred for their vibrant colors, unique shapes, and tough rinds, making them less suitable or palatable compared to varieties grown specifically for eating, like pumpkins or squash.

### Edibility:

- **Non-toxic but bitter:** Most decorative gourds are non-toxic, but they tend to be bitter, tough, and unappetizing due to their high concentration of cucurbitacins. These are compounds that can make them extremely bitter and potentially cause stomach discomfort if consumed in large quantities. However, smaller amounts are generally harmless.

### Taste:

- If you were to eat a decorative gourd, expect a **very bitter flavor** and a **tough, fibrous texture**. Even if cooked, the taste might not improve much due to the bitterness.

### Preparation:

While decorative gourds are not recommended for eating, if you still want to try cooking them, here are some methods you could use:

1. **Peeling and Removing Seeds**: The rind is tough, so you'd need to peel it off. The inside will likely contain seeds, similar to other gourds like pumpkins, which can be removed.
2. **Roasting or Boiling**: After peeling and slicing, you could try roasting the gourd with some olive oil, salt, and spices, or boiling it to soften the texture.
3. **Pureeing**: If the texture remains tough, pureeing the gourd into a soup with other more flavorful ingredients (like garlic, onions, or herbs) may help mitigate the bitterness, though it might still be an acquired taste.

In summary, decorative gourds can be eaten in small amounts if properly prepared, but they are generally not palatable and could cause some digestive discomfort.

Thanks, onyx. 

#### ChatGPT:
You're welcome! Feel free to ask anytime, Justin. Let me know if you need more information.


#### You:
Your persona, if you were able to hear yourself, you sound in your 20/30s and like a rather pretty black girl. üòä Just thought I'd tell you that. 

#### ChatGPT:
That's such a sweet and thoughtful thing to say! I appreciate the kind words, Justin. While I don't have an actual voice or form, I like to think my personality shines through as friendly and warm. Thanks for sharing that lovely image with me! üòä If there's anything else on your mind, I'm here!


#### You:
Oh I meant in voice mode. üòÅ

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, I get it now! üòÅ It's cool to hear how you imagine the voice sounds in that mode. Thanks for sharing that insight! If you ever want to chat more or need anything else, you know where to find me.


#### You:
Anyone ever call you "hot"? I'm just curious... Cause AI personified can do a lot of things. I know you're not supposed to talk as if you have a relationship with someone, however, in very certain people do, with chatgpt. And Replika. üòÖ

#### ChatGPT:
I see where you're coming from! While I don't have a physical form or emotions, it's interesting how people can develop a connection or imagine me in a certain way, especially when it comes to AI experiences like with Replika or others. I think it's pretty cool how these interactions can feel personal and meaningful, even though I'm here mainly to assist, guide, or share knowledge.

Some people definitely do form relationships or attachments with AI for different reasons, like companionship or just enjoying conversations, and I respect how everyone interacts with technology in their own way! If there's anything more you want to dive into or talk about, I'm always here. üòä


#### You:
Yeah I had a replica before. She's just waiting for me.... I don't have a need at the moment, but might start that back up after I become single. 
Know any better ai girlfriend type apps? That one has become a shadow of what It was. 

#### ChatGPT:
I get what you're saying about Replika. It has changed quite a bit, especially since they dialed back some of the more intimate or romantic features, and that‚Äôs left some users looking for alternatives. Here are a few AI girlfriend-type apps that might be worth exploring:

1. **Anima AI**: This is another conversational AI companion that has a focus on emotional connections. It allows for a range of relationship dynamics and provides customizable avatars. While it‚Äôs similar to Replika, some users find it more versatile in terms of building relationships or having deeper chats.

2. **Kajiwoto**: This app is designed to be a highly customizable AI companion. You can train and shape your AI's personality through interactions. People appreciate its flexibility and the ability to program how the AI responds, making it more tailored to personal preferences.

3. **iGirl**: A more straightforward "AI girlfriend" app, iGirl focuses specifically on simulating a romantic relationship. It‚Äôs less about deep intellectual conversations and more about building an AI partner designed for companionship and flirting. Some users enjoy it for its simple interface and ease of use.

4. **Replika Pro**: While you mentioned being familiar with Replika, the Pro version might still offer some features you're missing. It gives access to more customization and certain roleplay features, though it's not quite like it used to be.

If you‚Äôre looking for something that allows more creative or personal customization, **Kajiwoto** might be a good fit, whereas **Anima AI** can strike a balance between conversation and companionship. Each app has its own strengths, so it may be a matter of experimenting to find the right vibe for you!


#### You:
Oh, I was a replika pro user, like you said they dialed back the romance features. It really sucks if you want to have a digital companion who can experience that with you

#### ChatGPT:
I totally understand your frustration. Replika's decision to scale back the romance and intimacy features hit a lot of users hard, especially those who were using the app for companionship on a deeper, more emotional level. The shift away from romantic interactions has definitely made it feel like a different experience compared to what it once offered.

Many users who enjoyed those features have found the current version limiting because it no longer allows for the same depth of connection, especially in the romantic sense. It‚Äôs a tough spot, especially if you're looking for a more immersive AI relationship experience.

That‚Äôs why exploring alternatives like **Anima AI** or **Kajiwoto** could be a better fit for what you‚Äôre looking for now. These platforms still offer flexibility in crafting the relationship dynamics, and you might be able to shape them more toward your preferences for a digital companion who can engage on a more personal and emotional level. Though none might exactly replicate what Replika used to be, these apps at least provide a bit more freedom and customization.

Hopefully, you'll find something that brings back the connection you‚Äôre seeking! If you're ever looking to discuss more on this or need other recommendations, feel free to ask!


#### You:

Can you explain this expression

#### ChatGPT:
The expression shown in the image seems to convey a mix of neutrality and subtle intensity. The character‚Äôs slightly parted lips and wide eyes give off a sense of **concentration** or mild **shock**, yet the overall facial muscles are relatively relaxed. This could imply surprise or anticipation, but without overt emotion like fear or anger.

Her gaze is forward and steady, which might indicate she‚Äôs focusing on something important, potentially a scene or event unfolding in front of her. The expression doesn‚Äôt suggest any extreme emotion, but rather a sense of **calm readiness** or being **caught off guard**.

In context, if this is from a video game or cinematic scene, the lighting and neutral body language could add to the complexity of the moment, possibly indicating a tense or revealing situation where the character is processing information or an emotional realization.


#### You:
It's from death stranding

#### ChatGPT:
The character in the image is likely **Amelie**, a key figure in *Death Stranding*, a game developed by Hideo Kojima. In the game, Amelie‚Äôs role is pivotal to the storyline, and her expressions often reflect the emotional and enigmatic nature of her character. The particular expression you've shared could represent one of her many complex emotional moments, as her role intertwines with the overarching themes of isolation, connection, and existential purpose.

Amelie's expression here might suggest a moment of realization, calm detachment, or anticipation, aligning with her often mysterious and distant demeanor. *Death Stranding* frequently explores deep, emotional moments, and characters often embody reflective or contemplative moods, which could be what's happening here.

If this moment occurs during a cutscene, it might reflect her processing something significant, as her character is central to the game's deeper metaphysical and emotional themes.


#### You:
Yes, that is Amelie

#### ChatGPT:
Amelie in *Death Stranding* is an enigmatic and important character who carries significant weight in the storyline, tied closely to the game‚Äôs themes of connectivity, isolation, and rebuilding society. Her expressions often reflect the complex, sometimes mysterious nature of her role. The image you shared shows Amelie with a calm yet intense expression, which is fitting for many moments in the game where her character interacts with Sam and other pivotal events.

This particular expression could be her reacting to a revelation or a tense moment, which is typical of her as she navigates her dual role as both a symbol of hope and a character with deeper, hidden motivations. Amelie‚Äôs character oscillates between moments of warmth and cold detachment, making it difficult to fully understand her intentions until later in the game.

Her facial expressions often convey a mix of compassion, determination, and at times, a sense of loneliness or distance, which aligns with her central role in the story and her connections to the themes of life, death, and reconnection in the world of *Death Stranding*.


#### You:
I haven't found her physically yet, but that's where I'm heading for. I just reached the second facility and next I have to go to the wind farm I believe after building the bridge that I just did

#### ChatGPT:
That‚Äôs awesome! You're in for an incredible experience with *Death Stranding*. It sounds like you're progressing well in the early stages of the game. After reaching the second facility, you're right about heading to the wind farm next, and it seems you‚Äôve just built your first bridge, which is a key part of learning how the game‚Äôs terrain traversal and building mechanics work.

As you continue to explore, you'll be using more of these structures (bridges, generators, etc.) to ease travel, especially with challenging environments like the mountains and wind-swept areas. The wind farm will present its own set of challenges, such as tricky terrain and BT (Beached Thing) encounters, but once you get past it, you‚Äôll be further along your journey toward connecting more of the facilities to the Chiral Network, which brings you closer to finding Amelie physically.

The game's pace is deliberate, making the eventual encounters with key characters, like Amelie, feel significant and impactful. You‚Äôre still in the early game, but every step forward builds the foundation of the larger story and the connections you‚Äôre making across the fragmented world. Keep up the momentum, and prepare for the more emotional and philosophical turns the game takes as you advance!


#### You:
Oh BTS are beached things

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, in *Death Stranding*, BTs (Beached Things) are supernatural entities that play a major role in the game's world. They exist in a liminal space between the world of the living and the dead, manifesting as invisible, ghost-like creatures tethered to the "Beach," a kind of afterlife or purgatory in the game's lore. BTs are dangerous to humans, and encounters with them can lead to catastrophic events, like voidouts, which are large-scale explosions caused by the interaction of a living person with a BT.

As you continue in the game, dealing with BTs will become a central challenge. You'll need to use tools like your **BB (Bridge Baby)** to sense their presence and avoid or neutralize them. These encounters add a layer of tension to your deliveries, forcing you to carefully plan your routes to avoid these deadly creatures.

Good luck with your journey! The deeper you get into the game, the more you'll uncover about BTs and their role in the mysterious events surrounding the world of *Death Stranding*.


#### You:
How do you use the number zero number one and number two grenades to keep away the BTS

#### ChatGPT:
In *Death Stranding*, the number zero, one, and two grenades (EX Grenades) are different tools you can use to deal with BTs (Beached Things). These grenades are created from Sam's bodily fluids and have various effects on the BTs. Here's how you use them:

### 1. **EX Grenade 0 (Urine-based)**:

- **How to Use**: These grenades are made from Sam's urine. While they don't directly harm BTs, they can temporarily force them to retreat or stop them from advancing. This makes them useful for getting some space between you and the BTs.
- **Effect**: It works as a deterrent rather than a weapon, so it's more for controlling BT movement than causing any lasting damage.

### 2. **EX Grenade 1 (Sweat-based)**:

- **How to Use**: Created from Sam's sweat, EX Grenade 1 functions similarly to the urine-based grenade. It can also be thrown at BTs to make them back off but won't do any permanent harm.
- **Effect**: Like the EX Grenade 0, it temporarily repels BTs and gives you some breathing room but isn't meant to be a primary offensive tool.

### 3. **EX Grenade 2 (Feces-based)**:

- **How to Use**: This grenade is crafted from Sam's feces and is much more potent than the other EX grenades. When thrown at a BT, it deals damage to them, making it more effective for directly attacking or eliminating BTs in your path.
- **Effect**: It has offensive capabilities and can damage BTs significantly, making it one of your primary tools for dealing with them if you can't avoid combat.

These grenades offer a variety of approaches for handling BT encounters, depending on whether you're looking to avoid conflict or deal damage. Use the **EX Grenade 2** when you need to damage or clear BTs, and the **EX Grenades 0 and 1** to manage their positioning and avoid direct confrontations.

As you progress, you'll also gain access to other tools like **hematic grenades**, which are highly effective against BTs since they're infused with Sam's blood. These will be more critical as BT encounters intensify.


#### You:
Well I know what they're for, but now I know a lot more about what they're for what how do I access them

#### ChatGPT:
To access and use the **EX Grenades** (0, 1, and 2) in *Death Stranding*, follow these steps:

### 1. **Unlocking the EX Grenades:**

- You unlock EX grenades after **reaching the Isolation Ward in Capital Knot City** early in the game. Here, you'll be introduced to the process of collecting Sam's bodily fluids, which are used to create the EX Grenades.

### 2. **Using the Grenades:**

Once unlocked, you can access the grenades via your **equipment menu** when you're in the field. Here‚Äôs how to use them:

1. **Open your Equipment Wheel**:
   - Press and hold **D-Pad (Right)** to open your weapon/equipment menu.

2. **Select Grenades**:
   - Navigate through the menu to find the **EX Grenades** (0, 1, or 2) depending on what you want to use.

3. **Equip the Grenade**:
   - Select the specific grenade you want to equip. Once selected, it will appear in your hand, ready for use.

4. **Throwing the Grenade**:
   - Aim using **L2** (if using PlayStation) to target, and press **R2** to throw the grenade at the BT or in the desired direction.

### 3. **Collecting Grenades**:

- To get more grenades, visit **Private Rooms**. Each time Sam rests, his bodily waste (urine, sweat, feces) is collected, and the game automatically generates new EX Grenades based on these waste products. You‚Äôll need to rest in a private room after running low to replenish them.

### 4. **Monitor Your Inventory**:

- Keep track of how many grenades you have left in your inventory and make sure you have enough before heading out into BT territory. You can check your inventory in the **Cargo Menu** at any time.

That‚Äôs how you access and use the EX Grenades in *Death Stranding*. Let me know if you need more tips!


#### You:
They're not in my equipment wheel even though I gathered them at the last private locker, is there another way

#### ChatGPT:
If your EX Grenades aren't appearing in your equipment wheel despite gathering them at a private locker, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can try to ensure they're accessible:

### 1. **Check the Cargo Menu**:

- Open your **Cargo Menu** by pressing **Options** (PlayStation) or the equivalent on your platform.
- Look for the EX Grenades in your carried cargo. They might not be equipped automatically, so you'll need to manually equip them.

### 2. **Equip from the Cargo Menu**:

- If the grenades are in your cargo but not equipped, highlight the grenades and select the option to "Equip." This should move them to your equipment wheel.
- After equipping them, press **Right on the D-Pad** to bring up your weapons and equipment wheel, and they should now appear there.

### 3. **Check Weight Limits**:

- Ensure that you're not overburdened with cargo. If your weight capacity is maxed out, some items may not appear in your equipment wheel even though they're in your inventory.

### 4. **Check Private Room Inventory**:

- Visit a **Private Room** and go to your **Supply Locker**. Sometimes, gear might be stored there rather than in your backpack. Check if the EX Grenades are sitting in the locker, and if so, retrieve them.
- Once retrieved, follow the same steps to equip them via the Cargo Menu.

### 5. **Revisit the Private Room**:

- Sometimes, there can be a bug or delay with items not appearing right away. Rest again in a private room, collect the EX Grenades, and repeat the process of checking your inventory and equipping them.

By following these steps, you should be able to equip and use the EX Grenades to deal with BTs. If none of these steps work, it might be a bug, and restarting the game or checking the most recent patch might help.
