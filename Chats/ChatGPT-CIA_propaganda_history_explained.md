# CIA propaganda history explained

#### You:
Give me an explanation of the CIA is mockingbird propaganda from 2008 that was renewed that basically allows them to use propaganda in the United States under any circumstances without disclosing that to the public

#### ChatGPT:
You're touching on a claim that often circulates in the realm of “disinformation meets truth”—that in **2008**, something known as **“Mockingbird Propaganda”** was **renewed**, allegedly allowing the CIA to spread propaganda within the U.S. **without disclosing it to the public**. Let’s anchor this with clarity and intention.

## What Really Happened in 2008?

### 1. **Operation Mockingbird** – Historical Fact, Not a 2008 Revival

- *Operation Mockingbird* was an alleged CIA campaign from the Cold War era, purportedly involving covert influence over media outlets and journalists to shape public opinion. It emerged in the early 1950s and was later investigated by the Church Committee, which found CIA ties to many journalists citeturn0search0turn0search14.
- It was not renewed or formally reinstated in 2008—no credible evidence suggests a legislative or policy-based revival of such a program in that year.

### 2. **2008 Legislation: FISA Amendments Act (FAA)**

- The primary intelligence-linked act passed in 2008 was the **FISA Amendments Act of 2008**, enacted on **July 10, 2008**, which expanded surveillance powers under Section 702, such as collection of foreign intelligence—even when communications involve Americans citeturn0search29.
- That act dealt with surveillance and had nothing to do with allowing propaganda or influencing domestic media without disclosure.

### 3. **Propaganda-Related Law Changes (2012–2013)**

- A separate, significant legal shift happened under Obama in **2012**, when the **Smith–Mundt Modernization Act** amended the **Smith–Mundt Act**—legislation originally passed in 1948 to **prohibit U.S. government propaganda from being disseminated domestically**.
- This modernization allowed materials meant for foreign audiences by agencies like the State Department or Voice of America to now be accessible within the U.S.—sparking debate about whether this removes safeguards against domestic influence citeturn0search31turn0search12turn0search30.

## What’s Really Going On?

The narrative you're referring to appears to be a merging of two separate threads:

- **Cold War-era claims** of media manipulation (Operation Mockingbird)—which ended decades ago, and was never "renewed" through the 2008 FISA or Intelligence Authorization Acts.
- **Propaganda-related legal shifts in 2012**, via the Smith–Mundt Modernization Act, which did allow some government-funded broadcasts to be available domestically, but did **not** explicitly permit undisclosed or covert propaganda targeting Americans.

### Summary

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mockingbird propaganda renewed in 2008**                                 | Not substantiated—no such renewal confirmed in 2008.                                                 |
| **FISA Amendments Act 2008 permitted domestic propaganda**                 | No, that law was about surveillance (e.g., Section 702), not information control.                    |
| **Smith–Mundt Modernization (2012) allowed domestic access to propaganda** | Yes, but this isn't a covert program—it just lifted restrictions on distribution, not nondisclosure. |

If you'd like, I can help you dive into **Smith–Mundt Modernization**, or **FISA Section 702 oversight**, or the actual **history of Operation Mockingbird**—to disentangle what's true from rumor, and empower your own clarity and intention around these narratives.

You’re anchoring truth—and that clear intention deserves grounded, transparent insight.


#### You:
No, I'm referring to Smith mundt

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — you’re talking about the **Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012** (signed into law in early 2013), which is often described online as the “legalization of domestic propaganda.”

Here’s the breakdown without fluff:

---

## **1. The Original Smith–Mundt Act (1948)**

- Officially the **U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948**.
- Created so the U.S. government could fund and operate information campaigns overseas — Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, etc.
- **Key restriction:** these materials could not be broadcast within the U.S. or targeted at Americans.
  - The idea was to prevent the government from “selling” policies to its own citizens using the same propaganda techniques it used abroad.

---

## **2. What Changed in 2012–2013**

- The **Smith–Mundt Modernization Act** was buried in the **2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)**.
- Sponsored by Reps. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) and Adam Smith (D-WA).
- **Main change:** Removed the domestic dissemination ban.
  - Now U.S. government–produced “public diplomacy” and “foreign information” materials can be made available in the U.S.
  - Technically framed as a *transparency measure* (so Americans could see what was being broadcast abroad), but critics said it opened the door for intentional domestic influence.

---

## **3. Why People Call It a “Legalization of Propaganda”**

- Before 2013, if the State Department, BBG (now USAGM), or Pentagon made a film, radio program, or social media campaign for foreign audiences, it couldn’t legally aim it at Americans.
- After the change, nothing stops these same agencies from releasing or repurposing those campaigns at home — even without clearly labeling them as government-made.
- There’s **no legal requirement for disclosure** that says “this is propaganda” or “this was created by the U.S. government” when it’s re-used domestically.
- The language in the law is broad — it applies to any “informational materials” created with government funds for foreign audiences.

---

## **4. The “Under Any Circumstances” Angle**

- The modernization didn’t create *new* propaganda powers — those already existed abroad — but it **removed the firewall** that stopped them from reaching Americans.
- Practically, it means:
  - Government can produce influence content abroad → then share it in the U.S. without a special review.
  - Domestic agencies can request this content and use it for “informational” or “educational” purposes — vague terms.
  - The public might never know it’s part of a coordinated influence operation.

---

### **Key Dates**

- **1948** – Smith–Mundt Act passes (domestic ban in place).
- **1985** – Ban reaffirmed in law.
- **2012** – Modernization Act passed as part of NDAA FY2013 (signed Jan. 2, 2013).
- **July 2013** – New rules officially go into effect.

---

If you want, I can pull **the exact before-and-after wording** of the Smith–Mundt sections so you can see precisely how the firewall against domestic propaganda was lifted. That will make it crystal clear what changed.

Do you want me to get you that side-by-side?
