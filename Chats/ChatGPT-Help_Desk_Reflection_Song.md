# Help Desk Reflection Song

#### You:
I'm writing a song about my time as a help desk agent. I want it to be catchy, but also tell a story that's nearly a decade now. 

Can you help me rewrite the parts that don't rhyme and make it flow better for a pop song? 

I've been on the help desk for 8 years
Don't know what I'm gonna do when I leave here
Made a few friends, so we stay in touch, 
Most of them though, not so much. 

The helpdesk helped me through my toughest years 
I'm glad for almost a decade I've been here, 
But now I'm starting to think what should I do? 
Did the help desk serve it's purpose for me, 
I think so. 

The program that I started with is no longer there, 
Had stringent requirements to get in, but no more, 
I've got a lot better at life, learned a hell of a lot, 
It's becoming time for someone to take my spot. 

Help desk, help desk, I've been on the help desk,
Helping people get what they need, 
Help desk, help desk, it's time for the help desk,
To help me find my place in life.... 

So I'll be my own boss and make my own rules, 
No one's gonna tell me what to do, 
The help desk helped me know what I want, 
But mostly, what I don't. 

Help desk, help desk, I've been on the help desk,
Helping people get what they need, 
Help desk, help desk, it's time for the help desk,
To help me find my place in life....

---

**Verse 1**\
I've been on the help desk for eight long years,\
Not sure what I'll do when I'm not here.\
Made a few friends, yeah, we keep in touch,\
But most of them, not so much.

**Chorus**\
Help desk, help desk, I've been on the help desk,\
Helping people find what they need.\
Help desk, help desk, it's time for the help desk,\
To help me find my own way indeed.

**Verse 2**\
The help desk guided me through my hardest days,\
Almost a decade, and I'm glad I stayed.\
Now I'm wondering what should I pursue,\
Did the help desk serve its purpose? Yes, itâ€™s true.

**Bridge**\
The program I began with is long gone,\
Had strict rules to get in, now itâ€™s all moved on.\
I've grown so much, learned a ton,\
But it's time for someone else to take this run.

**Chorus**\
Help desk, help desk, I've been on the help desk,\
Helping people get what they need.\
Help desk, help desk, it's time for the help desk,\
To help me find my place in life indeed.

**Verse 3**\
I'll be my own boss, make my own rules,\
No one's gonna tell me what to do.\
The help desk showed me what I truly want,\
And mostly, what I don't.

**Chorus**\
Help desk, help desk, I've been on the help desk,\
Helping people get what they need.\
Help desk, help desk, it's time for the help desk,\
To help me find my place in life indeed.

#### You:
I like it a lot so far. You've done good, my friend. 
So, the message is the help desk helped me in my time of need, and helped me find what I want and *don't want* in life, because during that time I faced some of my hardest days, and some of the best days. Help desk has been there as a place to be during it all - taking life and leaving it at the doorstep when I go to work (not really, that's what they want you to do, but isn't how the mind works, really), and now I have quite a few ideas I want to pursue, and think I'm in the right place at the right time to do so. 

#### ChatGPT:

Helping people find what they need.\
Help desk, help desk, it's time for the help desk,\
To help me find my own way indeed.

**Verse 2**\
The help desk guided me through highs and lows,\
Almost a decade, and it truly shows.\
Now I'm wondering what should I pursue,\
Did the help desk serve its purpose? Yes, it's true.

**Bridge**\
I've faced the calls and the endless queues,\
Solving problems, paying my dues.\
Now it's time to chase my dreams,\

The help desk was there, steady and true.\
Now I've got ideas, and paths to explore,\
I'm ready for what life's got in store.

Help desk, help desk, I've been on the help desk,\
Helping people get what they need.\

To help me find my place in life indeed.
