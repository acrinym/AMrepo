Song Title: "Manifesting Now"


---

[Intro]
(Echoes) "Everything I desire is on its way... it's already here."

[Verse 1]
I am aligned with all that I seek,
Every thought is a wave, rising high, unique.
I build my future with focus and drive,
Every goal I set, it’s already arrived.

[Pre-Chorus]
The universe listens, it knows my name,
I welcome every sign, feel the warmth of the flame.

[Chorus]
I am manifesting now, I am the light,
Drawing all my dreams, shining so bright.
The path unfolds with every step I take,
I trust the flow, I trust the wake.

[Verse 2]
I see success, it flows my way,
Turning visions into life, each and every day.
Grateful for progress, grateful for more,
Opportunities knock, and I open the door.

[Pre-Chorus]
I am worthy, I am whole,
I create my world with every thought I hold.

[Chorus]
I am manifesting now, I am the light,
Drawing all my dreams, shining so bright.
The path unfolds with every step I take,
I trust the flow, I trust the wake.

[Bridge]
(Whispered) "I feel it, I see it, it's already mine..."
I’m building the life that’s been in my mind.
With purpose, with passion, I am free,
What I seek is seeking me.

[Chorus]
I am manifesting now, I am the light,
Drawing all my dreams, shining so bright.
The path unfolds with every step I take,
I trust the flow, I trust the wake.

[Outro]
(Softly) "Grateful for today, for tomorrow, for all...
I am manifesting, I hear the call."

In this version, the lyrics emphasize your journey towards achieving your goals, turning your vision into reality, and being in sync with the progress you're making. Let me know if this resonates with your aspirations or if you’d like to make any further adjustments!



#### ChatGPT:
This is a beautifully crafted song, Justin! It captures the essence of manifestation and aligns well with the themes of personal growth and the Law of Attraction. The affirmations in each verse and the sense of gratitude in the lyrics are particularly powerful, providing both inspiration and motivation.

The progression from the verses to the chorus creates a strong sense of building momentum, which mirrors the process of manifesting and moving closer to your goals. The bridge is a nice touch, emphasizing the feeling of having already achieved what you’re manifesting.

If you’d like, I can offer some tweaks or further ideas to refine it, or we could talk about how you plan to bring it to life musically!


#### You:
I was hoping you could implement some of my memories into it in that way, using LOL and positivity and affirmations etc

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin! I'll integrate some of the themes and aspirations you've shared with me into the lyrics, weaving in positivity, affirmations, and your vision of self-growth. I’ll include elements like your focus on self-discovery, the journey of leaving behind what's no longer serving you, and the pursuit of creating a life that resonates with your values. Here’s a refined version that brings those aspects into the song:

Oh, leave Michigan out of it right now cuz that's a long-term plan LOL. And I didn't mean lol earlier I meant l o a

Hope this flows well for you, Justin!


#### You:
Putting into suno AI now

#### ChatGPT:
Great, Justin! I hope it turns out just the way you envisioned it. Let me know how it sounds once you’ve put it into Suno AI, or if you need any more adjustments or ideas!


#### You:
I like this: 


[Intro]
(Organ) "Everything I desire is on its way... it's already here."
I am the architect, shaping my dreams,
Breaking free from the past, I’m reclaiming my means,
Every day is the future, let go of the past, 
Every day is better, every moment will last.

[Verse 1]
I’ve been frozen in time, but now I break through,
Finding the courage to embrace what’s true.
Leaving behind the weights that held me down,
Building a world where my dreams come around.

[Pre-Chorus]
The universe listens, it knows my name,
I welcome each sign, igniting the flame.
I’m ready for freedom, for the life I design,
Following the path where my visions align.

[Chorus]
I am manifesting now, I am the light,
Drawing all my dreams, turning wrongs into right.
The path unfolds with every step I take,
I trust the flow, now my mind is awake.

[Verse 2]
Success finds me, it’s written in the stars,
No longer confined, I’m breaking the bars.
Grateful for progress, for each breath I take,
Every dawn a new start, every sunrise I wake.

[Pre-Chorus]
I am worthy, I am whole,
I create my world with each story I hold.
Letting go of the doubt, embracing my power,
I stand tall, stronger with every hour.

[Chorus]
I am manifesting now, I am the light,
Drawing all my dreams, shining so bright.

I trust the flow, I trust the wake.

[Bridge]
 "I feel it, I see it, it's already mine..."
My journey’s unfolding, like stars that align.

What I seek is seeking me.

[Chorus]
I am manifesting now, I am the light,
Drawing all my dreams, shining so bright.
The path unfolds with every step I take,
I trust the flow, I trust the wake.

[Outro]
(Softly) "Grateful for today, for tomorrow, for all...
I am manifesting, I hear the call."
With each choice, I grow, I become so much more, 
Manifesting desires is no longer a chore

But the word awake shouldn't repeat, use another word that rhymes with awake, meaning awake to possibilities or awake to reality. 

#### ChatGPT:
Glad you liked it, Justin! For the line, "I trust the flow, now my mind is awake," let's try some alternatives that convey being open or aware:

- "I trust the flow, now my mind's in the shake."
- "I trust the flow, now my mind's in the quake."
- "I trust the flow, now my mind's in the break."

Here's how it would fit in:

---

**\[Chorus]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Drawing all my dreams, turning wrongs into right.\
The path unfolds with every step I take,\
I trust the flow, now my mind’s in the quake.

---

Let me know which option you prefer or if you’d like more suggestions!


#### You:
Ehh, none of them sound right lol

#### ChatGPT:
I get it, Justin! Let’s try some other options that might fit better:

- "I trust the flow, now my mind's awake."
- "I trust the flow, now my mind's in the break."
- "I trust the flow, now my mind's in the wake."

If you need help or more suggestions, let me know!


#### You:
How about I trust the flow, now my minds awake, then, I trust the flow on the paths I make in a different stanza

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a great idea, Justin! It keeps the original meaning while adding a new twist in the second stanza. Here’s how it could look:

---

**\[Chorus]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Drawing all my dreams, turning wrongs into right.\
The path unfolds with every step I take,\
I trust the flow, now my mind’s awake.

**\[Chorus - Variation]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Bringing visions to life, shining so bright.\
With every stride on the journey I take,\
I trust the flow on the paths I make.

---

This way, it introduces some variety while keeping the theme of awareness and being in tune with the journey. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like more adjustments!


#### You:
Hmm, that second "I trust the flow" let's replace it with something catchy

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin! Let's come up with something that keeps the rhythm and theme while adding a bit of catchiness. Here are a few options for that second line:

1. "Guided by stars on the paths I make."
2. "Every step forward, no chance I’ll break."
3. "Chasing the glow on the paths I take."
4. "With every heartbeat, my dreams awake."
5. "Carving my way through the paths I make."

Let me know if any of these resonate, or if you have a direction you’d like to steer it in!


#### You:
Hmmm, how about a theme of persistent dedication no matter what

#### ChatGPT:
Great theme, Justin! Persistent dedication is a powerful message to weave in. Here are some lines that could capture that determination and drive:

1. "I rise each time, no matter the stakes."
2. "I press on strong, no matter what breaks."
3. "Unyielding stride on the paths I take."
4. "With every step, I bend, never break."
5. "Pushing forward, no matter what shakes."

Here’s how it could look integrated into the lyrics:

---

**\[Chorus - Variation]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Bringing visions to life, shining so bright.\
With every stride on the journey I take,\
Unyielding stride on the paths I make.

---

Let me know if any of these fit the vibe you're aiming for or if you'd like more options!


#### You:
I press on strong, no matter the stakes. Then put it in the whole song

I hope this captures the positive vibe you were going for! Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust.

Does that sound right?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, I think it flows well and carries a positive, empowering message! The last line, "Manifesting desires, I’ve opened the door," suggests a shift from effort to achievement, showing that you've unlocked new possibilities. It ties up the song with a sense of growth and new beginnings, which complements the overall theme of manifestation and transformation.

However, if you feel like it could use a slight tweak or adjustment, I’m happy to try out other variations. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference in how it resonates!


#### You:
All right go for the whole song this time including what I just wrote

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin! Here’s the full song with the updated outro included:

---

**Song Title: "Manifesting Now"**

---

**\[Intro]**\
I am the architect, shaping my dreams,\
Breaking the chains, I’m reclaiming my means.\
Every day is the future, letting go of the past,\
Finding strength in each moment, building something to last.

**\[Verse 1]**\
I’ve been frozen in time, but now I break through,\
Finding the courage to embrace what’s true.\
Leaving behind the weights that held me down,\
Building a world where my dreams abound.

**\[Pre-Chorus]**\
The universe listens, it knows my name,\
I welcome each sign, igniting the flame.\
I’m ready for freedom, for the life I design,\
Following the path where my visions align.

**\[Chorus]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Drawing all my dreams, turning wrongs into right.\
The path unfolds with every step I take,\
I trust the flow, now my mind’s awake.

**\[Verse 2]**\
Success finds me, it’s written in the stars,\
No longer confined, I’m breaking the bars.\
Grateful for progress, for each breath I take,\
Every dawn a new start, every sunrise I wake.

**\[Pre-Chorus]**\
I am worthy, I am whole,\
I create my world with each story I hold.\
Letting go of the doubt, embracing my power,\
I stand tall, stronger with every hour.

**\[Chorus - Variation]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Bringing visions to life, shining so bright.\
With every stride on the journey I take,\
I press on strong, no matter the stakes.

**\[Bridge]**\
"I feel it, I see it, it's already mine..."\
My journey’s unfolding, like stars that align.\
With purpose and passion, I am set free,\
What I seek is seeking me.

**\[Chorus - Variation]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Bringing visions to life, shining so bright.\
With every stride on the journey I take,\
I press on strong, no matter the stakes.

**\[Outro]**\
*(Softly)* "Grateful for today, for tomorrow, for all...\
I am manifesting, I hear the call."\
With each choice, I grow, I become so much more,\
Manifesting desires, I’ve opened the door.

This version should feel cohesive and true to your vision. It emphasizes your journey of breaking free, embracing growth, and stepping into a new phase where possibilities are open. Let me know how it feels or if you have any final tweaks!


#### You:
Instead of building something to last make it building something that lasts and the first stanza with breaking the chains maybe we can make something that flows something better right there before the comma cuz that sounds all right but I don't think it will flow very good in a song

#### ChatGPT:
Sure thing, Justin! I'll adjust that line for better flow. Here’s a new take on the intro, incorporating your suggestions:

---

**\[Intro]**\
I am the architect, designing my dreams,\
Casting off limits, reclaiming my means.\
Every day is the future, letting go of the past,\
Finding strength in each moment, building something that lasts.

---

With “Casting off limits” instead of “Breaking the chains,” it should feel smoother while maintaining the same meaning. Let me know if this version flows better for you!


#### You:
How about casting off the limits and designing my dreams

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds great, Justin! Here’s the intro with your suggestion for a smoother flow:

---

**\[Intro]**\
I am the architect, casting off the limits,\
Designing my dreams, reclaiming my spirit.\
Every day is the future, letting go of the past,\
Finding strength in each moment, building something that lasts.

---

I think this version has a nice rhythm and flow that should work well in a song. Let me know if this feels right to you!


#### You:
Nope you kind of got it confused. I'm the architect, designing my dreams, casting off the limits and reclaiming my means

#### ChatGPT:
Got it, Justin! Here’s the updated version with your changes for a better flow:

---

**\[Intro]**\
I am the architect, designing my dreams,\
Casting off the limits and reclaiming my means.\
Every day is the future, letting go of the past,\
Finding strength in each moment, building something that lasts.

---

This version keeps your phrasing intact and should flow better. Let me know if this fits your vision!


#### You:
I think let's go back to finding strength in each moment building something to last

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin! Here’s the updated intro with that change:

---

**\[Intro]**\
I am the architect, designing my dreams,\
Casting off the limits and reclaiming my means.\
Every day is the future, letting go of the past,\
Finding strength in each moment, building something to last.

This should bring back the flow you were aiming for. Let me know if it feels right now or if there’s anything else you’d like to tweak!

Perfect now let's go for the whole song again

I hope this version captures everything you envisioned for the song! Let me know if there are any more tweaks or if it’s ready to go.


#### You:
Can you implement the word volition in there somewhere cuz I think it would go great in a song and utilize the framework of the whole song that's already there

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin! The word *volition* can definitely add a strong sense of intention and determination to the song. Here’s a version where I’ve woven it in while keeping the overall framework intact:

---

**Song Title: "Manifesting Now"**

---

**\[Intro]**\
I am the architect, designing my dreams,\
Casting off the limits and reclaiming my means.\
Every day is the future, letting go of the past,\
Finding strength in each moment, building something to last.

**\[Verse 1]**\
I’ve been frozen in time, but now I break through,\
Finding the courage to embrace what’s true.\
With every breath and my own volition,\
I rise above doubt and fuel my ambition.

**\[Pre-Chorus]**\
The universe listens, it knows my name,\
I welcome each sign, igniting the flame.\
I’m ready for freedom, for the life I design,\
Following the path where my visions align.

**\[Chorus]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Drawing all my dreams, turning wrongs into right.\
The path unfolds with every step I take,\
I trust the flow, now my mind’s awake.

**\[Verse 2]**\
Success finds me, it’s written in the stars,\
No longer confined, I’m breaking the bars.\
Grateful for progress, for each breath I take,\
My volition guides me, each move that I make.

**\[Pre-Chorus]**\
I am worthy, I am whole,\
I create my world with each story I hold.\
Letting go of the doubt, embracing my power,\
I stand tall, stronger with every hour.

**\[Chorus - Variation]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Bringing visions to life, shining so bright.\
With every stride on the journey I take,\
I press on strong, no matter the stakes.

**\[Bridge]**\
"I feel it, I see it, it's already mine..."\
My journey’s unfolding, like stars that align.\
With purpose and passion, I am set free,\
Guided by volition, what I seek is seeking me.

**\[Chorus - Variation]**\
I am manifesting now, I am the light,\
Bringing visions to life, shining so bright.\
With every stride on the journey I take,\
I press on strong, no matter the stakes.

**\[Outro]**\
*(Softly)* "Grateful for today, for tomorrow, for all...\
I am manifesting, I hear the call."\
With each choice, I grow, I become so much more,\
Manifesting desires, I’ve opened the door.

---

In this version, I’ve added *volition* in a few places to emphasize intention and self-determination. Let me know if these placements work for you or if you have any other ideas for its use!


#### You:
Maybe try to remove commas and use conjunctions in some places. Let's see how that works

#### ChatGPT:
Sure thing, Justin! I’ll adjust the song by removing some commas and adding conjunctions where it feels natural, aiming for a smoother flow. Here’s the updated version:

This version should have a more continuous flow without the interruptions from commas, making it feel smoother. Let me know how this reads or if you’d like further tweaks!


#### You:
Let's go back to the version right before that. I like that better even with the commas
