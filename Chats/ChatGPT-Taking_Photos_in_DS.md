# Taking Photos in DS

How do I take a picture with an Xbox controller in death stranding? There's no take photo button. Look

In *Death Stranding*, taking photos directly with a simple button press like on some other games isn't built into the control scheme, even with an Xbox controller. However, you have a couple of options to capture in-game photos:

### 1. **Use the Photo Mode**

The game includes a *Photo Mode*, which allows you to adjust the camera, change poses, and apply filters. Here’s how to activate it:

1. **Pause the game** by pressing the **Menu** button.
2. Select **Photo Mode** from the menu options.
3. Once in Photo Mode, you can adjust the camera angle, zoom, and apply various filters.
4. When you've got the shot set up, press **X (on an Xbox controller)** to snap the photo.

After you've taken the picture, you can save it to your gallery (if on console) or screenshot it directly if you're on PC.

### 2. **Using Xbox’s Screenshot Feature**

If you just want to quickly capture what’s on the screen without using Photo Mode, you can use Xbox’s built-in screenshot function:

1. Press the **Xbox button** on your controller to bring up the guide menu.
2. From here, press the **Y button** to take a screenshot (or **X** to record a video clip).

This will save a screenshot of whatever's on your screen at the moment. This method doesn’t let you adjust angles or apply filters but is quicker if you need an on-the-spot capture.
