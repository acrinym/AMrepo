#### ChatGPT:
Alright, let me break it down for ya:

A **consigliere** (sometimes spelled consigliori) is like the right-hand man to the boss in a mob family. This role is all about advisin' the boss, offering wise counsel, and helpin' make those tough decisions. They ain't directly involved in the day-to-day operations but are crucial for strategic planning and keeping things smooth.

A **capo** (short for caporegime or capodecina) is like a middle manager in the mob hierarchy. These guys control a crew of soldiers and are responsible for makin' sure the boss's orders are carried out. They handle collections, enforce rules, and manage smaller operations within the family. Think of 'em as the bridge between the boss and the street-level soldiers.

So, in short, the consigliere advises, and the capo leads the troops. Got it?Alright, let me break it down for ya:
