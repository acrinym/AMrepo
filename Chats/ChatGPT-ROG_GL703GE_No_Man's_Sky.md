- When you connect an eGPU to a system with no dedicated graphics card, the eGPU can act as the **primary display output**. However, you may need to adjust BIOS settings to ensure the system recognizes the eGPU as the primary graphics device, especially if there’s no integrated GPU in your CPU/motherboard.
- If the eGPU is properly recognized during boot, your desktop should use the eGPU for all graphics tasks, including booting up and running the operating system.

### **3. Installing Drivers**

- Once the system boots, you will likely need to install the necessary **drivers** for the eGPU (depending on the GPU you install in the enclosure). Most eGPUs use standard drivers provided by NVIDIA or AMD, depending on the GPU inside the enclosure.

### **4. Powering the System**

- Ensure that your system's USB-C port can provide enough power or that your motherboard can handle booting without an internal GPU. In most cases, desktops with Thunderbolt 3 can rely on the eGPU for graphics, but you may need to make adjustments in the BIOS to ensure smooth operation.

### **5. Performance Considerations**

- While an eGPU can work on a desktop system through Thunderbolt 3, **performance will be slightly lower** than using the same GPU in a desktop's PCIe slot. Thunderbolt bandwidth is lower than direct PCIe, but it still provides good performance, especially for gaming, video editing, or other GPU-heavy tasks.

### **Steps to Set Up eGPU on a Desktop with USB-C (Thunderbolt 3)**:

1. **Check Thunderbolt Compatibility**: Verify that your desktop’s USB-C port supports **Thunderbolt 3** or **Thunderbolt 4**. This can usually be found in the motherboard’s manual or specifications.

2. **Connect the eGPU**: Plug the eGPU into the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port on your desktop.

3. **BIOS Settings**: Enter the **BIOS** and ensure that the system is set to use **external graphics** as the primary GPU. You may need to disable any onboard graphics settings if present.

4. **Install Drivers**: Boot into your operating system and install the appropriate **GPU drivers** from the GPU manufacturer (NVIDIA or AMD).

5. **Set eGPU as Primary Display**: If the system boots properly, you should be able to set the external GPU as the primary display output in your system settings (Windows or macOS).

### Conclusion:

If your desktop has a **Thunderbolt 3**-enabled **USB-C** port, you can use an eGPU to act as the primary graphics adapter and boot the system using it. However, without Thunderbolt support, a USB-C port will not suffice for eGPU use. Always check your system's motherboard specs to ensure compatibility.

#### You:
Nice specs. Can a razer blade i7-6700q hold an HDD? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, the **Razer Blade (2016 model with the i7-6700HQ)** can hold an HDD, but it's a bit limited in terms of internal storage options compared to other gaming laptops. Here's how storage works with that particular model:

### **Storage Configuration:**

- The **Razer Blade (2016)** primarily comes with **M.2 NVMe SSD storage** as the internal drive. It does not have a dedicated bay for a 2.5-inch HDD (which is common in many other gaming laptops).
- **No 2.5" SATA slot**: Unfortunately, there is no space or connection for a 2.5-inch HDD inside the Razer Blade itself, meaning you can't install a standard internal HDD.

### **Options for Expanding Storage:**

If you want to add HDD storage to this laptop, here are a few alternatives:

1. **External HDD**:
   - You can use a **USB 3.0 external HDD** for additional storage. This is a good option for storing large files like media, backups, or less speed-critical data while keeping the internal SSD for faster applications and games.

2. **External SSD**:
   - For faster external storage, you could use an **external SSD**. While it would be more expensive than an external HDD, it would offer much faster read/write speeds, closer to what you're used to with an internal SSD.

3. **Upgrade the M.2 SSD**:
   - If you're running out of space on your internal SSD, you can **upgrade the M.2 NVMe SSD** to a larger capacity drive. The Razer Blade (2016) supports **PCIe NVMe M.2 SSDs**, so upgrading to a higher-capacity SSD (1TB or 2TB) is a good option for both speed and storage expansion.

### Conclusion:

The **Razer Blade i7-6700HQ (2016)** doesn't have the physical space for an internal 2.5-inch HDD. However, you can use external storage (either HDD or SSD) via USB, or upgrade the internal M.2 SSD if you need more storage space.
