The term *et al.* is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase *et alia*, which means "and others." It's commonly used in academic and professional writing to indicate that a work has multiple authors without listing all their names individually. This shorthand is particularly useful in citations and bibliographies.

For example:

- In a citation: "Smith et al. (2020) conducted a study on climate change."
- In a bibliography entry: "Smith, J., et al. 2020. *The Effects of Climate Change*. New York: Academic Press."

In this context, *et al.* implies that Smith is the primary author, but others contributed to the work as well.The term *et al.* is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase *et alia*, which means "and others."
