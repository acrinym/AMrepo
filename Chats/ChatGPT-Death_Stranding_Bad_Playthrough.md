# Death Stranding Bad Playthrough

#### You:
Okay, so for death stranding, what would happen if you did a playthrough where everything you had delivered had damage and you just did a really crappy play through on purpose, I'm curious what the outcome of that would be besides tediousness

#### ChatGPT:
Playing *Death Stranding* with the intention of damaging every delivery and actively making choices that lead to poor performance would certainly result in a unique experience with a few specific outcomes beyond just feeling tedious:

1. **Lower Connection Levels:** In *Death Stranding*, completing deliveries with high cargo damage decreases the "Connection Level" with NPCs and facilities. This affects the rewards and the types of items or resources you unlock. By delivering everything damaged, you’d get fewer resources, worse materials, and limited access to upgraded equipment, making your journey across the world harder and your survival more difficult.

2. **Reduced Story Progression and NPC Reactions:** NPCs in *Death Stranding* react differently based on the quality of deliveries. Consistently delivering damaged cargo would lead to less favorable reactions and limit certain storylines or side quests that would normally trigger with higher ratings. NPCs might show their disappointment or frustration, impacting the story’s immersive experience.

3. **Difficulty Progressing in Later Game:** Many tools and vehicles you acquire in the game make traversing the world easier. Delivering damaged goods slows this progression considerably, forcing you to rely on basic equipment longer and making the already harsh landscapes even tougher. Bridges, roads, and ziplines are harder to complete or upgrade, making travel more time-consuming and dangerous.

4. **Penalties on Player Ratings and Bridge Links:** The game has a rating system with categories like Delivery Time and Cargo Condition. Damaging everything would tank your scores in these categories, which in turn affects your overall ratings. If you’re connected to the online features, other players might see your low scores on bridge links, which could impact your interactions in the shared world aspects, as players prefer to reward helpful, high-rated couriers.

5. **Decreased Resources and Lost Items:** Damaged items often result in fewer materials or lost cargo pieces. This would make the game more resource-starved as you progress, requiring you to take on extra tasks just to gather essentials.

6. **Missed Trophy/Achievement Opportunities:** If you care about trophies or achievements, doing a “bad” playthrough would lock you out of several, including ones for high-ranking deliveries or unlocking all items.

7. **Heightened Risk of Failure in Hazardous Areas:** Areas with BTs (Beached Things) and MULEs (roaming bandits) are challenging, and without top-tier gear, your encounters with them would be more intense, potentially even frustrating. If you can’t access better weapons or exoskeletons, you’d be in for some challenging combat and escapes.

In essence, a deliberately poor playthrough would add another level of difficulty and change the tone from one of building and connecting to more of a survival struggle. It’s an interesting way to experience the game, but it would likely amplify the feelings of isolation and struggle without the satisfaction of improving the world and forging strong connections that *Death Stranding* is all about.Playing *Death Stranding* with the intention of damaging every delivery and actively making choices that lead to poor performance would certainly result in a unique experience with a few specific outcomes beyond just feeling tedious:
