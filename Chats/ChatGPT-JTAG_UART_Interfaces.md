# JTAG UART Interfaces

#### You:
What's that thing called where you can unlock or root a device using a low-level direct connection device called? I know cmos, bios, processors, phones, and most electronics have one of these ports or at least points on the board to allow connection or soldering of these connections to it but I can't remember what it's called

#### ChatGPT:
What you're describing is likely referred to as a **JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)** or **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** interface. These are debugging and development interfaces commonly found on PCBs for low-level device communication, flashing, or rooting purposes. Here's a breakdown:

1. **JTAG (Joint Test Action Group):**
   - A standard interface for debugging embedded systems and programming devices like microcontrollers, FPGAs, and processors.
   - It allows direct access to a device's hardware for testing, programming, and debugging at a very low level.
   - Often used for advanced tasks like recovering bricked devices, bypassing security, or flashing firmware.

2. **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter):**
   - A simpler serial communication protocol often exposed via a port or pads on a PCB.
   - Commonly used for sending commands to devices, debugging output, or accessing low-level system consoles.

3. **ISP (In-System Programming):**
   - Refers to connections for programming microcontrollers or flash memory without removing them from the device.
   - Typically uses pins like SPI, I²C, or proprietary protocols.

These interfaces often require specialized tools such as:

- **JTAG programmers** (e.g., Segger J-Link, OpenOCD-compatible devices).
- **UART to USB adapters** (e.g., FTDI chips or CP2102 modules).
- **SOIC clips or pogo pin adapters** for connecting to the solder pads or test points on a PCB without permanently soldering wires.

Devices with these ports or pads often have labels like `TX`, `RX`, `GND` (for UART) or `TCK`, `TDO`, `TDI`, `TMS`, `GND` (for JTAG) silkscreened on the board. If you're trying to identify or use these interfaces, a multimeter and datasheets for the device in question can be invaluable.What you're describing is likely referred to as a **JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)** or **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** interface.
