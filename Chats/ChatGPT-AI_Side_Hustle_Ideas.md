# AI Side Hustle Ideas

#### You:
Generate business ideas based on my expertise, querying my intent and expertise and once I am queried, let's get to work. The ideas must require ZERO capital and be something that can be repeated over and over. They also should be side-hustles using ChatGPT and similar AI tools. 

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you're looking for a side hustle that aligns with your tech expertise, interests in alternative knowledge, and perhaps some of the entrepreneurial thinking you've been nurturing. Let's explore ideas that require **no capital**, can be **scaled easily**, and involve leveraging tools like ChatGPT.

### First, let’s clarify your intent and areas of focus:

1. **What aspects of your tech experience do you want to leverage?** (e.g., troubleshooting, system management, software development, automation, etc.)
2. **How comfortable are you with providing a service vs. creating digital products?**
3. **Are you looking to focus on technical fields (e.g., tech support, automation) or expand into alternative niches you're interested in (e.g., free energy, natural healing)?**
4. **How much time do you aim to spend on these side hustles per week?**
5. **Would you prefer a passive income model (digital products, courses) or active (consulting, freelance work)?**
6. **How important is automation to your side hustle ideas?**
7. **Are there specific audiences you're aiming to serve (e.g., small businesses, individuals interested in alternative knowledge, etc.)?**

Once we narrow down the focus based on your answers, I can generate more tailored ideas.

#### You:
One question at a time. 

#### ChatGPT:
Got it! Let’s start with the first question:

**What aspects of your tech experience do you want to leverage?** (e.g., troubleshooting, system management, software development, automation, etc.)


#### You:
I have 8 years of tech support experience for USDA, so I know ADUC, Intune, Citrix Workspace, but I don't know code. 
I have ios/android experience and also have experience rooting devices(means little to nothing anymore, but I thought it was worth mentioning) and making tickets. 
I'm familiar with AvayaOne Agent and Citrix Cloud. 

#### ChatGPT:
Thanks for that clarity! Based on your experience in tech support, let's leverage your knowledge in **troubleshooting, systems management, and working with common IT infrastructure tools**. Here’s the next question:

**How comfortable are you with providing a service (e.g., consulting, troubleshooting) vs. creating digital products (e.g., guides, templates, courses)?**

This will help me focus the business ideas on either service-based or product-based ventures.
