Opening PowerShell as a standard user when it defaults to opening with admin privileges can be done in a few ways. Here’s how you can achieve this:

### Method 1: Using the Start Menu

1. **Search for PowerShell**:
   - Press the **Windows key** on your keyboard or click the **Start** button.
   - Type **"PowerShell"** in the search bar.

2. **Open as Standard User**:
   - Simply click on **Windows PowerShell** from the search results.
   - Do **not** click on **"Run as administrator"**.

### Method 2: Using a Shortcut

1. **Create a Shortcut**:
   - Right-click on your desktop or in a folder where you want the shortcut.
   - Select **New** > **Shortcut**.

2. **Shortcut Location**:
   - In the location field, type: `powershell.exe`
   - Click **Next** and give your shortcut a name, such as "PowerShell (Standard User)".
   - Click **Finish**.

3. **Modify Shortcut Properties** (if necessary):
   - Right-click the newly created shortcut and select **Properties**.
   - Go to the **Shortcut** tab and ensure the **Target** field is `powershell.exe`.
   - Click **OK**.

### Method 3: Using Run Dialog

1. **Open Run Dialog**:
   - Press **Windows key + R** on your keyboard.

2. **Type Command**:
   - In the Run dialog box, type `powershell` and press **Enter**.

This will open PowerShell as a standard user. If you need to make this change permanent, ensure that any shortcuts or pinned items you use to launch PowerShell do not have the "Run as administrator" option enabled by default.Opening PowerShell as a standard user when it defaults to opening with admin privileges can be done in a few ways.
