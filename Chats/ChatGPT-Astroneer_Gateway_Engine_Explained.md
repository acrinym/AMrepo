# Astroneer Gateway Engine Explained

#### You:
What is this giant purple ring at the core of the planet in astroneer

#### ChatGPT:
In *Astroneer*, the giant purple ring at the core of the planet is part of the planet's gateway engine, which is a key structure in the game. The gateway engine is located deep within each planet and is connected to the planet's gateway chambers on the surface. These structures are part of the game’s lore and are essential for unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

To activate the gateway engine, you'll need to provide a specific resource unique to that planet. Once activated, you can access the gateway portal network, allowing you to teleport between the core of the planet and its surface, as well as between different planets if you've activated their engines.

The purple ring itself is part of the visual design of the gateway engine and serves as a central point within the engine's chamber. It’s a significant element of the game's progression system, so exploring and understanding these structures is crucial as you advance in *Astroneer*.In *Astroneer*, the giant purple ring at the core of the planet is part of the planet's gateway engine, which is a key structure in the game.

#### You:
I have no idea how to do anything with this gateway engine. It doesn't appear to have power connectors

#### ChatGPT:
The gateway engine in *Astroneer* is indeed a bit different from other structures in the game because it doesn't require power in the traditional sense, and there are no power connectors. Here's how to interact with it:

1. **Locate the Gateway Engine:**\
   First, you need to reach the core of the planet where the gateway engine is located. This usually involves digging down to the very center of the planet.

2. **Identify the Required Resource:**\
   Each planet’s gateway engine requires a specific resource to be activated. When you get close to the gateway engine, you’ll notice several platforms with a triangular symbol on them. Hovering over these symbols will give you a hint as to which resource you need. The required resources are different for each planet. For example:
   - Sylva (starting planet) requires **Quartz**.
   - Desolo requires **Zinc**.
   - Calidor requires **Explosive Powder**, and so on.

3. **Insert the Resource:**\
   Once you’ve identified the required resource, gather it and place it on one of the triangular platforms on the gateway engine. You’ll need to place the resource in the slot, and once the correct resource is placed, it will be consumed, and the gateway engine will activate.

4. **Activation and Usage:**\
   When the gateway engine is activated, the giant purple ring and the surrounding area will light up, and you'll have the option to interact with a central object. This object is called the Odd Stone. When you interact with the Odd Stone, it will bring up a teleportation menu. You can now teleport between the gateway engine and any activated gateway chambers on the surface, as well as other activated engines on different planets.

5. **Collecting the Geometric Triptych:**\
   Upon activation, the gateway engine will also produce a unique object called a **Geometric Triptych**. This item is necessary for further progression, especially for unlocking the ultimate secrets of the game at the gateway engines of other planets.

**Note:** Each planet's core needs to be activated separately, and each has a different required resource. You’ll need to repeat this process on every planet if you’re aiming to fully explore the game’s lore and complete the gateway system.

So, while it might seem confusing at first, once you have the correct resource and insert it into the gateway engine, everything will become more clear, and you’ll be able to progress in the game!
