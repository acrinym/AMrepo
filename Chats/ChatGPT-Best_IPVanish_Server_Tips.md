2. **Lowest Ping for Gaming:** For gamers, selecting a server with the lowest ping is crucial. In the IPVanish app, go to the Server List, sort by Ping, and select the server with the lowest number. This will ensure a smoother and faster gaming experience【10†source】.

3. **Changing Your Location:** If you're looking to appear as if you're in a different location, choose a server in the desired country or city. This can help you access region-restricted content or maintain anonymity【9†source】.
