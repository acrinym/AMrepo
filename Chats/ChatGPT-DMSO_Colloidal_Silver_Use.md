# DMSO Colloidal Silver Use

#### You:
Is DMSO useful with colloidal silver for direct application to a cat with rodent abscess? 

#### ChatGPT:
When dealing with a rodent ulcer (also known as an eosinophilic granuloma complex or indolent ulcer) in cats, it's essential to proceed with caution regarding treatment options.

**DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide):**

- DMSO is a potent solvent and anti-inflammatory agent that can enhance the absorption of other substances through the skin. While it has therapeutic applications, it is generally not recommended for use in cats due to their sensitivity to many topical substances. Cats can absorb toxins more easily through the skin, and DMSO could carry potentially harmful substances into their bloodstream.

**Colloidal Silver:**

- Colloidal silver has been touted for its antimicrobial properties, but its efficacy is not well-supported by scientific evidence in veterinary medicine. Additionally, the safety of colloidal silver, especially in combination with other agents like DMSO, is not well-established for topical use in cats. Chronic exposure to silver can lead to argyria, a condition where silver particles accumulate in the body, causing a permanent bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, though this is rare.

### Recommendations:

1. **Avoid using DMSO and Colloidal Silver:** Given the risks associated with DMSO and the uncertain benefits of colloidal silver, it is advisable to avoid this combination for treating a rodent ulcer in cats.

2. **Consider safer alternatives:** Topical or systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, or immunomodulatory agents are the more standard treatments for eosinophilic granulomas. Cyclosporine or a hypoallergenic diet may also be considered, depending on the suspected underlying cause (e.g., allergies).

3. **Consult with a Dermatologist:** If the rodent ulcer is not responding to standard treatments, referral to a veterinary dermatologist may be beneficial.

How about DMSO and 3% food grade H202

#### ChatGPT:
Using DMSO in combination with 3% food-grade hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) on a cat, especially for a condition like a rodent ulcer (eosinophilic granuloma complex), is generally not advisable. Here’s why:

### **DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide):**

- **As previously mentioned:** DMSO is a powerful solvent that facilitates the absorption of substances through the skin. While it has anti-inflammatory properties, it can also increase the absorption of potentially harmful substances, including those not intended to be absorbed systemically.

### **Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂):**

- **Oxidative Damage:** Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidative agent and is primarily used for its antiseptic properties. However, even at a 3% concentration, it can cause tissue irritation and damage, especially in delicate areas or when used repeatedly. In cats, this can lead to discomfort, pain, and delayed healing.

### **Combination Risks:**

- **Increased Absorption of Harmful Agents:** When combined with DMSO, hydrogen peroxide’s potential for causing oxidative damage could be amplified, as DMSO may increase its absorption through the skin.
- **Risk of Chemical Burns:** The combination could increase the likelihood of chemical burns or further irritation, especially on already sensitive or ulcerated tissue.

### **Safer Alternatives:**

- **Topical Steroids or Antibiotics:** These are typically used to manage inflammation and prevent secondary infections in rodent ulcers.
- **Systemic Therapy:** Depending on the severity and underlying cause, systemic steroids or immunomodulatory drugs like cyclosporine may be more appropriate.

### **Recommendation:**

1. **Avoid the Combination:** The use of DMSO with hydrogen peroxide is not recommended due to the potential for significant tissue damage and the risk of systemic toxicity in cats.

2. **Consult Standard Treatment Protocols:** Consider using proven therapies such as corticosteroids, antibiotics, or immunomodulatory treatments under the guidance of a veterinarian.

3. **Monitor and Reevaluate:** If the ulcer is not responding to standard treatments, further diagnostic workup, including biopsy or allergy testing, may be necessary to tailor the treatment plan.

What safe application of dmso in combination with a general purpose antibiotic can be used? 

#### ChatGPT:
When considering the use of DMSO in combination with an antibiotic for topical application in cats, particularly for conditions such as skin infections or inflammatory lesions, it is crucial to select both the DMSO concentration and the antibiotic with care. Here’s a guide on how to approach this:

### **DMSO Concentration:**

- **Low Concentration Recommended:** DMSO should be used in a dilute form, typically 10-30%, to minimize the risk of irritation or systemic absorption of other compounds. A higher concentration may cause significant irritation, especially in cats.

### **Antibiotic Selection:**

- **Topical Antibiotics:** Commonly used topical antibiotics include **mupirocin** and **gentamicin**. Mupirocin is particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including *Staphylococcus* species, which are common in skin infections. Gentamicin has broader antibacterial coverage, including against Gram-negative organisms.

- **Formulation:** The antibiotic should ideally be in an ointment or cream base, which can be mixed with DMSO just prior to application. Avoid using preparations with added steroids unless specifically indicated, as combining these with DMSO can enhance absorption and increase systemic effects.

### **Application Guidelines:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Dilute DMSO to a 10-30% concentration using sterile water or saline.
   - Mix a small amount of the topical antibiotic with the DMSO immediately before application to ensure stability and effectiveness.

2. **Application:**
   - Apply the mixture sparingly to the affected area, typically once to twice daily.
   - Use gloves to prevent inadvertent absorption of DMSO and the antibiotic through your own skin.
   - Monitor the area for signs of irritation, excessive redness, or systemic effects, and discontinue use if any adverse reactions are noted.

3. **Duration:**
   - Treatment duration should be limited to the period necessary to resolve the infection or inflammation, generally not more than 7-10 days. Prolonged use increases the risk of irritation or sensitization.

### **Caution and Monitoring:**

- **Systemic Absorption:** While DMSO can enhance the penetration of antibiotics through the skin, it also carries the risk of systemic absorption, which can be harmful, particularly with aminoglycosides like gentamicin that have nephrotoxic potential.
- **Avoid Sensitive Areas:** Do not apply the mixture near mucous membranes, eyes, or large open wounds where absorption could be more significant.

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Consultation with a Veterinary Pharmacist:** Before preparing or using a DMSO-antibiotic combination, consulting a veterinary pharmacist can ensure proper formulation and dosage.

2. **Consider Alternatives:** If systemic antibiotic therapy is more appropriate, or if there's concern about the safety of DMSO in this specific case, systemic antibiotics with proven efficacy should be prioritized.

3. **Monitor Closely:** During treatment, closely monitor the cat for any adverse effects, both at the application site and systemically, given the cat's sensitivity to many topical treatments.
