### The Dark Side of the Rump

**(Verse 1)**
In the light of day, it's glitz and glam,\
All the promises, the lights, the grand slam,\
But behind the scenes, there's a shadowed tale,\
Where the whispers haunt and the smiles turn pale.

**(Pre-Chorus)**
They'll lure you in with a shining grin,\
But the secrets lie beneath the skin,\
Where the money flows, and the truth is bent,\
In the heart of the rump, where the dreams are spent.

**(Chorus)**
Oh, the dark side of the rump, where the shadows play,\
In the dark side of the rump, there's a price to pay,\
You can see the glitter, but it's all a front,\
In the dark side, oh, the dark side of the rump.

**(Verse 2)**
Promises of power, fame, and gold,\
But the heart grows weary, the soul feels cold,\
Behind closed doors, deals are made in the night,\
Where the lines blur between wrong and right.

**(Pre-Chorus)**
They'll paint you dreams with a golden brush,\
But underneath, it's a bitter hush,\
Where the lights shine bright, but the heart is numb,\
In the dark side, the dark side of the rump.

**(Chorus)**
Oh, the dark side of the rump, where the shadows play,\
In the dark side of the rump, there's a price to pay,\
You can see the glitter, but it's all a front,\
In the dark side, oh, the dark side of the rump.

**(Bridge)**
Every whisper, every sigh,\
Every tear that you can't deny,\
It's the cost of the game, the unspoken rule,\
In the dark side, you play the fool.

**(Chorus)**
Oh, the dark side of the rump, where the shadows play,\
In the dark side of the rump, there's a price to pay,\
You can see the glitter, but it's all a front,\
In the dark side, oh, the dark side of the rump.

**(Outro)**
So beware the charm, the dazzle, the allure,\
For the dark side waits, of that be sure,\
In the heart of the rump, where dreams may fall,\
In the dark side, the darkest side of all.### The Dark Side of the Rump
