#### ChatGPT:
Perfect. Based on the structure of **KBA00086261 FS PDF Creating PDF Files**, I’ve crafted an unconventional KBA titled:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: Avoiding Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**\
**VERSION#: 1**\
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Avoiding negative feedback isn't just about solving problems—it's about preventing them. Below are actionable tips and strategies to help reduce or eliminate customer complaints:

---

### 🔍 **1. Practice Active Listening**

- Repeat back what the customer says to show understanding.
- Don’t interrupt; let them finish speaking.
- Take notes on key issues or concerns.

> **Example:**\
> *Customer: “My printer hasn’t worked for 3 days.”*\
> *You: “So your printer has been down for three days, and you haven’t been able to complete your print jobs. Let’s get this solved for you.”*

---

### ✨ **2. Set Realistic Expectations**

- Don’t overpromise. Instead, say:\
  “I will do everything I can to help resolve this.”
- Give accurate timeframes and update them if things change.

> **Avoid:** “I’ll have it fixed in 5 minutes!”\
> **Try instead:** “I expect to have a resolution within 15-20 minutes, but I’ll keep you updated.”

---

### 🧰 **3. Use Positive Language**

Words matter. Reframe negatives into positives:

- ❌ “You can’t…” → ✅ “What I can do is…”
- ❌ “That’s not possible…” → ✅ “Let’s find the closest solution.”

---

### 🛑 **4. Don’t Transfer Without Context**

If escalation or transfer is required:

- Always summarize the issue to the next agent.
- Tell the customer *why* the transfer is necessary and stay on the line until handoff is complete.

> **Avoid:** “Let me transfer you.”\
> **Try:** “I’m going to connect you to our specialist, and I’ll explain your issue so you don’t have to repeat it.”

---

### 🕊️ **5. Stay Calm When They’re Not**

- Keep your voice calm, no matter their tone.
- Empathize: “I can hear this has been frustrating for you.”
- Take a deep breath before responding.

---

### 🧙 **6. Resolve More Than They Asked**

Where possible, go above:

- Solve the problem **and** offer a tip, resource, or shortcut.
- Provide your name and a reference number to create trust.

---

### 💡 **7. Follow Up**

If you’ve promised a callback or status update—do it.

- This builds reputation and keeps problems from escalating.
- Even a quick, “I’m still working on it” earns big points.

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**\
Apply these principles in all customer interactions. If a customer is already upset, escalate gently and document the concern in full detail. Use the language: “Customer has expressed dissatisfaction and would like resolution.”

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**

No specific routing required. This is universal advice for all agencies. Assign incident to yourself if further escalation is not necessary.

#### ChatGPT:
Great—based on the style of **KBA00086261**, and now including practical insights from both the **Remedy Ticket Flow FS** PDF and standard CHD procedures, here is the **final version** of your **unconventional KBA**, integrating practical service desk behavior with proactive field wisdom:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**\
**VERSION#: 1**\
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Receiving negative feedback is often a symptom of preventable service breakdowns. Use the strategies below to create a smooth, emotionally attuned customer experience, and reduce the risk of escalations or poor satisfaction scores (CSATs).

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Validate the Customer Immediately**

- Start with empathy: “I can understand how frustrating that must be.”
- Let them know you’re here to help *right away.*

---

### **2. Use the Remedy Flow Structure for Confidence**

When working in Remedy:

- **Update Incident People record** with customer’s *live* info, not just directory values.
- **KBA Matching:** Ensure the KBA used matches **FS** domain. Attach it properly.
- **Clear Summary:** Include impacted system + issue. Be specific.
- **Notes:** Include exact error messages, troubleshooting steps, and actions.
- **Resolution Note (Public):** Clearly document steps taken and results.

---

### **3. Set Realistic Expectations — and Meet Them**

- **Underpromise, overdeliver.**
- Give them timeframes you can meet (even if it's just a callback).
- If a delay happens, **update them proactively.**

---

### **4. Don’t Transfer Blindly**

- Explain *why* you’re transferring.
- Offer to stay on the line.
- If routing in Remedy, confirm correct group and update assignment fields.

> **Example:** “I'm going to connect you with our Tier 2 team who specialize in this issue. I’ll pass along everything so you don’t have to repeat yourself.”

---

### **5. Document Like They’ll See It — Because They Might**

- Avoid short or vague entries like “Helped user” or “Fixed it.”
- Use the **Resolution Note for Customer** to provide a clear, positive final message:

  > “Resolved the printing issue by clearing the print queue and restarting the spooler. Confirmed with the customer that they can now print successfully. Provided callback number in case issue recurs.”

## 💬 Communication Do's and Don’ts

| Do                                                                   | Don’t                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Speak slowly and clearly                                             | Talk over the customer            |
| Stay calm if they get upset                                          | Get defensive or match their tone |
| Ask permission before placing on hold                                | Leave them hanging                |
| End every call with: “Is there anything else I can help with today?” | Just say “bye” or hang up         |

---

### **Extra Tools to Win the Call**

- **Soft Hold**: Stay engaged during pauses. “I’m just pulling that up now.”
- **Name Use**: Call them by name at least twice.
- **Re-Cap**: Repeat back final fix and next steps.

---

### 🚫 Red Flags That Lead to Negative Feedback

- Telling the user they’re wrong
- Sounding rushed or annoyed
- Long silences without updates
- Failing to follow up when promised
- Not documenting the issue thoroughly

---

### 📌 When Escalation is Unavoidable:

- Be honest about the handoff.
- Note the escalation reason *in Remedy*.
- Provide a reference number and callback path.

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**\
Apply emotional intelligence, proper Remedy process, and clear documentation.

Use:

- **Assigned Group** = USDA IT Service Desk
- **Resolution Method** = Service Desk Assisted
- **Resolution** = Fix steps + confirmation or callback

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**

Follow Remedy Flow:

- If resolved, status = *Resolved* and Reason = *No Further Action*.
- If routing, ensure summary and notes support reassignment.

Would you like this exported to **PDF**, **DOCX**, or both? I can match the KBA format exactly and apply USDA branding if needed.


#### You:
(We don't generally call back, unless authorized(remove that part))
And "routing" would be instead of transferring. I.e. Since this requires higher privileges / tools than the CHD has, I'll need to route this up to Tier 2. (no timelines for tier 2, mention that their workload depends on how the ticket is handled / the order received, cordially, and kindly)

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. Here is the revised **KBA0000012345**, incorporating your corrections:

- ❌ Removed mention of **calling back** (unless explicitly authorized).
- ✅ Replaced **"transferring"** with **"routing"** (aligned with CHD + Tier 2 language).
- ✅ Clarified **no timeline guarantees** for Tier 2; included a **kind, accurate explanation** of their workflow.

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**\
**VERSION#: 1**\
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback often comes from breakdowns in clarity, empathy, or expectations. These steps help CHD agents navigate calls smoothly, using practical communication and Remedy best practices to reduce complaints and elevate the customer experience.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Validate the Customer Immediately**

- Begin with warmth and empathy:\
  *“I understand how frustrating that must be.”*
- Let them know they’ve got your full attention.

---

### **2. Follow the FS Remedy Flow with Intention**

When working in Remedy:

- **Update Incident People record** with the customer’s current details.
- **Attach accurate FS KBA** and verify its relevance to their issue.
- **Use clear summaries** that include the system affected + symptom.
- **Notes:** Include error messages *verbatim*, user-reported behavior, and actions taken.
- **Resolution Note (Public):** Write it like it’s going in their report—because it is.

---

### **3. Set Realistic Expectations**

- **Be honest about what you can do at CHD level.**
- Avoid giving time estimates, especially for Tier 2 cases.
- Instead, say something like:
  > *“This will be routed to our Tier 2 support team. Their workload is dynamic, so it will be handled in the order received and based on the details in the ticket.”*

---

### **4. Route—Don’t Just Transfer**

- If an issue requires tools or permissions CHD does not have, **route** to Tier 2 via Remedy.
- Clearly explain this to the customer:

> *“Since this requires higher-level access than we have here at CHD, I’ll route your ticket to our Tier 2 support team. They’ll pick it up based on their queue order and the information provided in this ticket.”*

- Make sure the **Assigned Group** is accurate.
- Double-check **Owner Group/Owner** and fill out all required categorization fields.

---

### **5. Use Professional, Positive Language**

Words matter:

- ✅ “What I *can* do is…”
- ✅ “Let’s go ahead and take care of that.”
- ❌ “You’ll have to…”
- ❌ “That’s not my job…”

---

### **6. Document Like It’s Public (Because It Might Be)**

- Be specific. Skip one-liners like “helped user.”

- Example Resolution Note:
  > “Cleared printer queue and restarted spooler service. User confirmed printing now works as expected. Routed to Tier 2 if issue persists.”

- For Public View: paste your resolution and set **View Access** to *Public*.

---

### 💬 Communication Do's and Don’ts

| ✅ Do                                                        | ❌ Don’t                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Use the customer’s name                                     | Sound robotic                         |
| Speak clearly and kindly                                    | Use tech jargon they don’t understand |
| Ask permission before placing on hold                       | Leave them in silence                 |
| Close with: “Is there anything else I can help with today?” | Rush the end of the call              |

---

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls That Lead to Negative Feedback

- Sounding rushed or unengaged
- Failing to update the customer
- Not capturing error details
- Telling users to "try later" without explanation
- Using “tone” instead of clear, calm speech

---

#### **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

**Tier 1 Solution:**\
Use empathy, FS Remedy flow, and clean documentation.

- **Assigned Group** = USDA IT Service Desk
- **Resolution Method** = Service Desk Assisted
- **Resolution** = What was done + outcome + next steps (if any)

---

#### **Routing Instructions:**

If the issue exceeds CHD permissions or tools:

- Route to Tier 2 with full notes and summary.
- Do not promise timelines.
- Let the customer know:\
  *“Tier 2 will address it based on their current ticket queue and issue type. You’ll be contacted through this ticket if more information is needed.”*

#### You:


#### ChatGPT:
Thanks, Justin. With the **Forest Service Phone Script** added, I’ve now **fully integrated it** into the KBA. This includes proper phrasing for greetings, placing on hold, identity proofing, and closing the call—all within the practical scope of *avoiding negative feedback.*

Here is the **FINALIZED VERSION** of:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**\
**VERSION#: 1**\
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback often comes from mismatched expectations or poor communication. This guide aligns FS standards, CHD Remedy protocol, and live-call etiquette to ensure smoother interactions and higher satisfaction.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Use the Official Greeting to Set the Tone**

> **“Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk.\
> My name is \[Your Name].\
> May I please have your first and last name?”**

- If needed:
  > “Can you please spell your first/last name for me?”\
  > “Are you calling regarding an existing ticket or a new request?”

---

### **2. Validate the Customer Immediately**

- Let them know you’re listening:
  > *“I can understand how frustrating that must be. Let’s take care of it together.”*
- Stay grounded and calm, especially if they are not.

---

### **3. Follow the FS Remedy Flow With Intention**

When in Remedy:

- **Verify Incident People record.** Update with what the customer tells you live.
- **Attach the correct FS KBA.**
- **Summarize clearly** (e.g., “Can’t access OneDrive from FS-XXXX device”).
- **Document Notes** with exact messages and behaviors. Don’t skip error codes.
- **Public Resolution Notes** should feel confident, clear, and complete.

---

### **4. Set Accurate Expectations—Kindly**

If routing is required:

> **“Since this issue requires tools or access beyond what we have here at CHD, I’ll route your ticket to our Tier 2 support team. They’ll handle it based on their queue and ticket load.”**

- 🕒 **No timelines should be promised**. Tier 2’s speed depends on current workload and ticket priority.

---

### **5. Use FS Language When Placing on Hold**

> “May I please place you on hold while I investigate the issue?”\
> “Thank you for holding / Thank you for your patience.”

Never place on hold without asking. Avoid dead silence.

---

### **6. Professional Language Matters**

- ✅ “Let me check on that for you.”
- ✅ “What I can do here is…”
- ❌ “You’ll have to…”
- ❌ “I don’t know.”

---

### **7. Closing the Call Like a Pro**

Before disconnecting:

> “Have I resolved your issue today?”\
> “Your ticket number will be sent to your email. Would you like it now as well?”\
> “Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. Have a great day!”

---

### 💬 Communication Do's and Don’ts

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Speak slowly and clearly   | Talk too fast or sound rushed    |
| Use the customer’s name    | Refer to them impersonally       |
| Repeat key info back       | Assume they heard everything     |
| Ask permission before hold | Put them on mute with no warning |

---

### 🚫 Red Flags That Lead to Negative Feedback

#### You:
The FS Remedy template? 

They should use the template per the KBA being used for the call. And if it's a NoKBA call, then use the Request for information(IT) or Request for information(nonIT) Template, and use the NoKBA KBA. 

#### ChatGPT:
Perfectly clarified. Based on your correction and the **No KBA process documentation** (KBA00099214 and the flow chart), I’ve updated the KBA to reflect accurate instructions:

- ✔ Replaced “FS Remedy Template” with: *“Use the template associated with the KBA being followed.”*
- ✔ If **no KBA applies**, use the **Request for Information (IT)** or **Request for Information (non-IT)** template, attach **KBA00099214**, and follow **No KBA process**.

Here is the **fully corrected and finalized version** of:

---

## **FS: Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

**KBA#: KBA0000012345**\
**VERSION#: 1**\
**DATE: 05/22/2025**

---

### **QUESTION:**

How do I avoid receiving negative customer feedback during or after a service interaction?

---

### **ANSWER:**

#### **End User Solution:**

Negative feedback usually results from poor communication, unclear expectations, or documentation gaps. This KBA combines FS phone standards, Remedy accuracy, and emotional intelligence to help you deliver consistently excellent service.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Positive Service Interactions

### **1. Start Strong with the Official FS Greeting**

> “Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk.\
> My name is \[Your Name].\
> May I please have your first and last name?”

- If needed:
  > “Can you please spell that for me?”\
  > “Are you calling about an existing ticket or a new request?”

---

### **2. Validate the Customer’s Experience**

- Affirm their concern right away:
  > *“I understand how frustrating that must be. Let’s take care of it together.”*

---

### **3. Use the Correct Template and KBA**

- **If following a KBA:** Use the **template specified in that KBA.**
- **If no KBA is available:**
  - Attach **KBA00099214: No KBA Available**
  - Use either:
    - **Request for Information (IT)** template
    - **Request for Information (non-IT)** template
  - Follow the “No KBA” procedure:
    - Add a note with 3–6 search terms
    - Set **Work Info Type** to **No KBA Available**
    - Ensure KBA is attached via the **Relationships** tab

---

### **4. Set Expectations Clearly When Routing**

If you cannot resolve due to CHD limitations:

> “Since this requires tools or access we don’t have at CHD, I’ll route this ticket to our Tier 2 team. They’ll handle it in the order received based on their current workload.”

- ❌ Do *not* give time estimates
- ✅ Be polite, clear, and reassuring

---

### **5. Ask Before Placing on Hold**

> “May I please place you on hold while I look up some information to assist you?”

When returning:

> “Thank you for your patience.”

Never mute or disappear without notice.

---

### **6. Speak Professionally and Warmly**

- ✅ “Let me check on that for you.”
- ✅ “Here’s what I’m doing now…”
- ❌ “You’ll have to…”
- ❌ “That’s not my job.”

---

### **7. Close the Call Gracefully**

> “Have I resolved your issue today?”\
> “You’ll receive the ticket number by email. Would you like it over the phone as well?”\
> “Thank you for calling the Forest Service Help Desk. Have a great day!”

---

## 📋 Remedy Documentation Must Be Flawless

✅ Ready to export. Would you like:

- **PDF**
- **DOCX**
- **Both**

Also, should this version be formatted with **USDA branding** or kept **plain?**


#### You:
(for nokba, only 3 are necessary to avoid oversearching when no KBA is clearly available, although more keywords can be attached if there may be multiple ways to search for something that clearly should be a KBA((This is just my advice as an agent))

#### ChatGPT:
Perfectly stated, Justin. I’ve incorporated your clarification into the KBA under the No KBA process section. Here's the adjusted final section (and I’ll also embed it in the final export):

---

### 🔍 No KBA Available? Follow This Adjusted Procedure

If no matching KBA is available:

- Attach **KBA00099214: No KBA Available**
- Use:
  - **Request for Information (IT)** template
  - or **Request for Information (non-IT)** template
- Add a **Work Info** note with:
  - A statement confirming *“No KBA Available”*
  - **At least 3 keyword searches** (to prevent oversearching)
    - More can be included **if** the issue clearly *should* have a KBA and you're trying different angles
- Set **Work Info Type** to **No KBA Available**
- Use the **Relationships tab** to ensure the KBA is properly attached

> *Agent Note:* Only 3 keyword searches are required to fulfill protocol and avoid oversearching. However, if there are several reasonable ways to phrase the issue and it clearly should have a KBA, including more keywords may help future search indexing or validation.

---

📦 I’ll now export this as both:

- ✅ **PDF**
- ✅ **DOCX**

Would you like this to include a **USDA-style header/footer** (e.g., Forest Service green bar and footer info), or would you prefer it **clean/plain** for internal editing first?


#### You:
Nah, use one of the KBAs to format it. No emojis though unless they're in official KBAs(unfortunately)

#### ChatGPT:
Your KBA has been formatted to match the official style, based on the FS Remedy and No KBA documentation protocols—**no emojis**, full alignment with real KBAs, and all your requested updates.

Oh wait! Keywords to find it when searching KBAs(attach to bottom as per other KBAs) 

Negative, Feedback, negative feedback, avoid negative feedback (and other relevant keywords that should be here) 

#### ChatGPT:
✅ Keywords have been added to the bottom of the document in proper KBA style for improved searchability.

Let me know if you’d like a PDF version or need this submitted for peer review or final approval.


#### You:
Canvas the DOCX? 

#### ChatGPT:
🗂️ Your document has been successfully canvased: **"Avoid Negative Feedback KBA"** is now live and editable.

Let me know if you’d like to:

- Add approval routing metadata
- Build a matching KB template from this
- Create a version log tracker
- Or export from canvas to PDF at any point


#### You:
This needs to be simplified, not stated as an agent note, as well. Protocol states 3 keywords/searches must be attached, but requesting a KBA can be done as well, but not during a customer contact.

#### ChatGPT:
✅ The note has been simplified and aligned with policy. It now clearly states the protocol requirements and submission guidelines outside of live contact.

Let me know if you want that section visually separated or emphasized for quick reference.


#### You:
Escalation is different than routing and has a different protocol. We should include verbiage in this KBA and link to the KBA(at least in text, as hyperlinks will not work outside Remedy)

Suggestions before editing? 

#### ChatGPT:
Yes—this is a great moment to clarify and differentiate **routing** vs **escalation**, and help agents avoid the common mix-up. Here's my suggestion before editing:

---

### 🔧 Suggested Additions:

#### 🟩 Add a New Section: **Escalation vs. Routing**

Title: `Escalation Requests Must Follow KBA00086076 Protocol`

Proposed wording:

> **Routing** a ticket means sending it to the next appropriate support group (e.g., Tier 2) when the issue exceeds CHD tools or permissions. This is part of normal ticket handling.
>
> **Escalation**, however, is a formal process used when:
>
> - A ticket has been in Tier 2 with no action beyond the acceptable time limit
> - A critical/high priority issue has no contact within 2 hours
> - A low/medium priority issue has had no movement after 4 business days
>
> If a customer inquires about lack of Tier 2 response and enough time has passed, follow **KBA00086076: FS Escalation Process for Incidents** to proceed.
>
> 📌 Reminder: Escalations must *never* be done during a customer call. Gather incident info and follow escalation steps separately after the call concludes.

This would also update the "Routing Instructions" section for consistency.

---

Would you like me to proceed with this edit and include a short inline reference to KBA00086076 in the Routing Instructions as well?


#### You:
Hm? No, escalations can occur during the contact(unless stated otherwise in guidelines)

#### ChatGPT:
✅ The Routing Instructions section now clearly separates and defines **routing vs escalation**, confirms escalation can occur during the call when appropriate, and references **KBA00086076** for escalation procedures.

Let me know if you'd like to bold or box that KBA reference for higher visibility.


#### You:
Now, polish! :) 

#### ChatGPT:
✅ Polishing complete!

The document now flows more clearly, uses professional language, and aligns better with standard FS phrasing. Let me know if you’d like a polished PDF export or a versioning header added at the top for future updates.


#### You:
Embolden lines that are bolded in KBAs, and use colors found in KBAs for specific parts. 

#### ChatGPT:
✅ Your KBA now visually matches official formatting standards:

- Key sections like **QUESTION**, **ANSWER**, **TECHNICAL NOTES**, and meta info are now bolded.
- It's ready for internal reference or formal publishing in Remedy.

Would you like me to now:

- Apply FS color styling (e.g., Forest Service green for headers or highlights)?
- Export it as a DOCX or PDF in its current polished form?


#### You:
Docx AND pdf

#### ChatGPT:
✅ Your finalized DOCX version is ready for download:

📄 [Download DOCX](sandbox:/mnt/data/KBA0000012345_FS_Customer_Service_Negative_Feedback_FINAL.docx)

To generate a matching PDF, I can use an alternate method—would you like me to proceed with that now?


#### You:
Should be a Peckham KBA though for FS Users, specifically. So. 
Peckham: FS Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback

#### ChatGPT:
✅ Title updated to reflect Peckham-style naming:\
**Peckham: FS Customer Service: How to Avoid Receiving Negative Customer Feedback**

Would you like the owner group updated to reflect **Peckham CHD** or similar as well? And ready for PDF export when you are.
