Shining stars in the sky
Together we can fly
Never say goodbye
Reachin' high we'll never die

Hopes and dreams just like candy
In this life it's so dandy
Hold my hand so handy
We can be so brandy

In this crazy crazy ride
We can take it all in stride

Feel the love it won't subside

#### You:
Why does clearing %locallowappdata% CryptNetCache help with SSL errors? 

#### ChatGPT:
Clearing the `%locallowappdata%\CryptNetCache` can help resolve SSL errors because this directory stores cached data related to cryptographic operations and certificates. Here are some reasons why clearing this cache might help with SSL errors:

1. **Corrupt Cache Data**: Sometimes, the cached data in the CryptNetCache folder can become corrupted. This corruption can lead to SSL errors because the system might be relying on outdated or incorrect information when establishing secure connections.

2. **Outdated Certificates**: The CryptNetCache folder may contain outdated or expired certificates that can cause SSL errors. Clearing the cache forces the system to retrieve fresh certificate information, which can resolve issues related to certificate validity.

3. **Network Changes**: Changes in network configuration or policy updates can render cached certificate information invalid. Clearing the cache ensures that the system fetches the latest information, which can help in resolving SSL errors arising from such changes.

4. **Policy Updates**: If there have been updates to cryptographic policies or root certificate authorities, the cached data might not reflect these changes. Clearing the cache ensures that the system uses the most up-to-date policies and root certificates.

5. **Performance Optimization**: In some cases, clearing the cache can help optimize performance by removing unnecessary or stale data that the system no longer needs, which can indirectly help in resolving SSL errors.

By clearing the `%locallowappdata%\CryptNetCache` folder, you essentially force the system to discard any potentially problematic cached data and re-establish secure connections with fresh, up-to-date cryptographic information.


#### You:
At windows login, my smartcard is not recognized. I cleared out all old certificates and "the smart card was not recognized. Please make sure it's inserted fully".... or something to that extent. What else can I do?
