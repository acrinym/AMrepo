#### You:
Can you set it throuogh powershell? 

#### ChatGPT:
You cannot directly set the new tab page in Microsoft Edge to a specific URL through PowerShell because Microsoft Edge does not expose a straightforward setting for this in its configuration files or via the registry.

However, you can use PowerShell to automate the installation and configuration of a new tab extension that sets the new tab page. Here's an example of how you might approach this task, although it will involve some manual steps to install the extension initially:

1. **Manually install a new tab redirect extension as described in the previous message.**

2. **Use PowerShell to configure the extension settings.**

The following PowerShell script assumes you have a JSON file containing the extension settings that specify the new tab URL. You need to adjust the paths and details according to your environment and extension.

### Example PowerShell Script

First, create a JSON file named `ExtensionSettings.json` with the following content:

```json
{
    "newtab": "https://www.google.com"
}
```

Then, use the following PowerShell script to copy this settings file to the appropriate location for the extension:

```powershell
# Define the path to the extension settings file
$settingsFilePath = "C:\Path\To\ExtensionSettings.json"

# Define the Edge extension folder (change this to match your environment)
$edgeExtensionFolder = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Extensions"

# Get the folder for the new tab redirect extension (adjust the extension ID to match your installed extension)
$extensionId = "your_extension_id_here"
$extensionFolder = Get-ChildItem -Path $edgeExtensionFolder -Recurse -Filter $extensionId | Select-Object -First 1

if ($extensionFolder -ne $null) {
    # Copy the settings file to the extension's folder
    Copy-Item -Path $settingsFilePath -Destination "$extensionFolder\settings.json" -Force

    Write-Output "Extension settings updated successfully."
} else {
    Write-Output "Extension not found."
}
```

### Steps to follow:

1. **Install the new tab redirect extension manually.**
2. **Find the extension ID:** Go to `edge://extensions/` in Edge and locate the ID of the new tab redirect extension.
3. **Adjust the script:** Replace `"your_extension_id_here"` with the actual extension ID.
4. **Run the script:** Save the PowerShell script and run it.

This approach involves manually managing the extension and its settings. Currently, Microsoft Edge does not provide a direct PowerShell command to change the new tab page URL due to its security and design architecture. If you need more advanced management of browser settings, consider using Group Policies for enterprise environments.


#### You:
Can't install extensions, so now what

#### ChatGPT:
If you cannot install extensions and still want to change the new tab page in Microsoft Edge to a specific URL like "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)", there isn't a direct way to achieve this through PowerShell or Edge's built-in settings due to the way Edge is designed.

However, there are a couple of alternatives you can consider:

### 1. Setting the Homepage and Using it Manually

You can set the homepage to "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)" and use the home button or keyboard shortcuts to quickly access it.

1. **Open Microsoft Edge.**
2. **Go to Settings:**
   - Click on the three dots (`...`) in the top-right corner and select `Settings`.
3. **Set the homepage:**
   - Go to `Start, home, and new tabs`.
   - Under `When Edge starts`, select `Open a specific page or pages` and add "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)".
   - Under `Home button`, toggle the switch on and set it to "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)".
4. **Use the home button:**
   - Click the home button (a house icon) to quickly navigate to Google.

### 2. Creating a Custom Shortcut

Create a custom shortcut that opens a new tab with "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)".

1. **Right-click on your desktop and select `New > Shortcut`.**
2. **Enter the following command:**
   ```
   msedge.exe --new-window "https://www.google.com"
   ```
3. **Click `Next` and name the shortcut, e.g., `Google New Tab`.**
4. **Click `Finish`.**
5. **Use this shortcut to open Edge directly to Google in a new window.**

### 3. Automate Opening Google in a New Tab via PowerShell

While this does not change the new tab page directly, you can create a script to open Edge with Google whenever you start it.

1. **Create a PowerShell script to open Edge with Google:**

```powershell
Start-Process "msedge.exe" "https://www.google.com"
```

2. **Save the script as `OpenGoogle.ps1`.**
3. **Create a task in Task Scheduler to run this script on startup:**

   - Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
   - In the `General` tab, name the task (e.g., `Open Google in Edge`).
   - In the `Triggers` tab, set the task to start at login.
   - In the `Actions` tab, set the action to start a program, and enter `powershell.exe` as the program.
   - In the `Add arguments` field, enter `-File "C:\Path\To\OpenGoogle.ps1"`.

By following these steps, you can automate opening Edge with Google, even if you cannot directly set the new tab page to a specific URL.

Loves to eat fish bones with ease,
Curled up tight, warm and snug,
In the sun, dreams so sweet.

Long whiskers, sniff and seek,
Silent steps, sneaky sneak,
Tail swaying, joyful leap,
Little bell, ringing clear.

Cat dreams bright, stars alight,
Kitten's heart, soft as might,
Little kitten, cutest sight,
Cat song, forever bright.
