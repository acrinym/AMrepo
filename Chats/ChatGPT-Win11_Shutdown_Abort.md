# Win11 Shutdown Abort

#### You:
I need a quick win11 shutdown aborter so it doesn't autorestart me for updates while I'm doing critical work. Batch me

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely. Here’s a super quick, reliable batch file you can run as admin to **abort any pending shutdown/restart** operation in Windows 11 (including update-forced restarts). This will instantly stop the countdown or pending auto-reboot.

## **Batch File: Abort Shutdown/Restart**

```bat
@echo off
:: Abort any scheduled shutdown/restart (including for updates)
shutdown /a
echo.
echo === Any pending shutdown or restart has been ABORTED! ===
echo (If you see "No shutdown was in progress", you’re safe.)
timeout /t 3 >nul
```

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Copy the code above into a new file, name it something like `AbortShutdown.bat`.
2. Right-click and **Run as Administrator** whenever you want to make absolutely sure Windows won’t restart on you.
3. You can even leave it on your desktop and double-click as needed.

---

#### **Pro Tip:**

If you want to keep Windows from scheduling these in the first place (or delay for much longer), you can also set your active hours or disable Windows Update service temporarily, but this batch will stop an active or scheduled restart *right now*.

Let me know if you want an even more advanced script (like one that loops or notifies you if an update is pending)!Absolutely.

#### You:
repeat it though cause it will try

#### ChatGPT:
You got it—Windows Update can be **relentless** and will often re-queue a shutdown/restart, especially after certain critical updates. The trick is to run `shutdown /a` **repeatedly**, ideally every minute or so, until you’re done working.

Here’s a batch script that **runs in a loop**, aborting shutdown every 30 seconds and showing a warning banner so you know it’s working:

## **Batch: Continuous Shutdown Aborter (Anti-Update Reboot Shield)**

```bat
@echo off
title [Win11 Anti-Update Reboot Shield]
color 1f
:loop
cls
echo =============================================
echo   [ABORTING ALL SHUTDOWN/RESTART COMMANDS]
echo   - Windows Update can't force-reboot you! -
echo =============================================
shutdown /a
echo [%date% %time%] Shutdown/Restart aborted.
timeout /t 30 >nul
goto loop
```

---

### **How to Use:**

- Save as `AntiUpdateAborter.bat`.
- **Right-click > Run as Administrator** for best results.
- **Leave this window open** while you work. It will keep aborting any shutdown/restart attempts every 30 seconds.

---

**You can change `timeout /t 30`** to a different number of seconds if you want more or less frequent checks.

#### If you want it to run hidden in the background (no window), let me know—I can make it into a hidden PowerShell or task tray utility too!

Let me know if you need further defense (like disabling the update service entirely or using Task Scheduler for even deeper protection).
