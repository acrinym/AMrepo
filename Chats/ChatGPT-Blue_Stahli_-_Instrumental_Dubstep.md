**Verse 1:**
In a city made of starlight, where dreams and shadows blend,
We chase the neon twilight, where the nights seem never to end.
Through a kaleidoscope of memories, we dance on beams of gold,
With every heartbeat echoing, a story yet untold.

**Chorus:**
We are the echoes in the night, reaching for the sky,
With every beat, we take flight, beyond the reasons why.
In the starbound symphony, we'll write our destiny,
With electric dreams and melodies, we'll set our spirits free.

Underneath the cosmic canopy, our hearts begin to race,
In a universe of harmony, we find our sacred space.
With every spark of wonder, we illuminate the dark,
Guided by the thunder of a million glowing sparks.

Through the galaxies we'll wander, on a journey to the stars,
In the silence, we grow fonder, of the echoes that we are.
We'll paint the skies with colors, no one else has ever seen,
In the music, we'll discover what it means to truly dream.

**Chorus:**
We are the echoes in the night, reaching for the sky,
With every beat, we take flight, beyond the reasons why.
In the starbound symphony, we'll write our destiny,
With electric dreams and melodies, we'll set our spirits free.

In the end, we'll find our place, in the symphony of time,
With every note, a warm embrace, in the rhythm so divine.

Now do this combination. A song inspired by Kurt Cobain lyrics and style, but sang by the Beastie boys, about a tangible current issue... How about censorship

#### ChatGPT:
### Verse 1:

In a world of endless noise, silence takes a stand,\
Voices in the shadows, whispers in the sand.\
Freedom's just a ghost, in the land of the free,\
Chains made of pixels, unseen tyranny.

### Chorus:

Shut down, locked out, words fall to the floor,\
Voices of the voiceless, knocking at the door.\
Censorship creeping, trying to divide,\
But truth is a rebel, it won't be denied.

### Verse 2:

Pages of history, inked in rebellion's fire,\
Now the screens flicker, truth tangled in the wire.\
Platforms of control, wielding digital blades,\
Cutting through the conscience, in a web of charades.

### Chorus:

Shut down, locked out, words fall to the floor,\
Voices of the voiceless, knocking at the door.\
Censorship creeping, trying to divide,\
But truth is a rebel, it won't be denied.

### Bridge:

We won't be silent, we won't be erased,\
In the face of the muzzle, our spirits embrace.\
Echoes of Cobain, in the digital age,\
Beastie Boys' defiance, breaking out of the cage.

### Chorus:

Shut down, locked out, words fall to the floor,\
Voices of the voiceless, knocking at the door.\
Censorship creeping, trying to divide,\
But truth is a rebel, it won't be denied.

### Outro:

In the maze of control, we'll light up the dark,\
With the power of the people, we'll make our mark.\
Through the noise and the silence, our message will ride,\
In the face of oppression, our truth will collide.
