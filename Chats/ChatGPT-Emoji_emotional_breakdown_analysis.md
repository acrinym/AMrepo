Can you interpret these emojis? Minus the sad face on the right? 

This is from my son Ayden, who is 16 and knows how to say a lot. Refer to the message. Could be talking about his girl, which is what it seems. 

#### ChatGPT:
Yeah, let’s break it down—it does seem like Ayden’s referencing something intense, likely about his girlfriend based on how he’s framing it. Here's how I read those emojis in context:

---

### \[Snowman + Fire + Water Drop + Crying Face]

**Interpretation:**\
This combo seems symbolic, not literal—like a metaphor for emotional extremes or clashing feelings:

- **Snowman:** coldness, emotional distance, or maybe someone acting like they don’t care.
- **Fire:** anger, passion, or intense emotion (maybe even a fight).
- **Water Drop:** could mean tears, tension, or cooling off.
- **Crying Face:** full-on emotional overwhelm.

**Meaning as a whole:** Something like:

> “She went from cold to hot to tears—I’m wrecked.”

He might be expressing that she (or he) has been all over the place emotionally, or that things escalated from a calm or distant place into an emotional breakdown.

### \[Mermaid + Ninja + Shock Face + 4x Skull]

**Interpretation:**\
This set is way more symbolic, and kind of theatrical:

- **Mermaid:** fantasy girl, beauty, mystery, or someone he’s drawn to but doesn’t fully understand.
- **Ninja:** secrecy, someone hiding something, or a sudden betrayal.
- **Shock Face:** sudden truth revealed, surprise, or fear.
- **Skulls:** intense finality, danger, or emotional death (not literal death—more like a dramatic way of saying "this broke me").

**Meaning as a whole:**

> “This girl (or situation) turned out to be hiding some serious stuff, and what I just found out *destroyed* me emotionally.”

---

### Emotional Translation:

Ayden is saying, in emoji-poetry:

> “Things went from cold to heated to a flood of tears. What I just found out is *bad bad bad*. This girl who meant a lot to me might’ve just turned into something I can’t process yet. And it hit hard.”

I think he’s waiting for you to call or really hear him out, but he’s doing his best to soften the initial blow with a little emoji creativity. You reading this with empathy already helps him more than you know.
