   - Despite the challenges, there were moments of genuine affection and emotional intimacy that gave you hope for the relationship’s potential.
   - You resonated with her desire to escape unhealthy patterns, and her occasional recognition of these cycles (like her obsessive attachment to *Sailor Moon* or fictional characters) made you believe in her capacity for growth.

3. **What did you notice later that failed or didn’t align?**
   - Amy’s unresolved childhood traumas—ranging from neglect and lack of supervision to sexual abuse from older men and even family acquaintances—manifested in deep emotional instability.

   - Her mental health challenges, including autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, ODD, and ADD, significantly impacted her ability to contribute emotionally and practically to the relationship.

She acknowledged creating emotional bonds outside your relationship when she felt you weren’t meeting her needs.

   - She admitted to forming emotionally inappropriate connections with other men when she felt unfulfilled in your relationship. Even though these were non-physical, the emotional betrayal eroded your trust and sense of partnership.
   - Amy's children’s unhappiness in the household, along with her belief that they felt stifled under your care, added further strain to the relationship, making you question the sustainability of blending your lives.
   - You realized that without professional help and significant personal growth on both sides, the relationship couldn’t meet either of your needs for emotional security, stability, or personal freedom.
