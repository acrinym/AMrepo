**Procedural OOPs and PHP:**

1. **Procedural Programming:**
   Procedural programming is a paradigm centered around creating functions that perform specific tasks. In this approach, the program executes a sequence of steps (or procedures) to complete an operation, often with shared variables and direct manipulation of data. Procedural code is easier for smaller, simpler applications but can become complex and difficult to maintain in larger systems due to tightly coupled components and lack of modularization.

   - **Advantages:**
     - Simplicity: Easy to understand for beginners, as it follows a top-down approach.
     - Quick development for small projects.
     - Functions are reusable in different parts of the program.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Less modularity and maintainability.
     - Harder to extend or scale for larger applications.
     - Data security is lower because variables are global, leading to potential conflicts.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   OOP, on the other hand, organizes code around objects rather than functions or logic. Objects represent real-world entities and encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that operate on the data. This paradigm promotes modularity, scalability, and reusability of code, especially useful for larger projects.

   - **Core Concepts of OOP:**
     - **Encapsulation:** Bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit, i.e., the object.
     - **Inheritance:** Allows one class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent), reducing redundancy.
     - **Polymorphism:** Different objects can be treated as instances of the same class through interfaces or inheritance.
     - **Abstraction:** Hides the complex implementation details, providing a simple interface to the users.

   - **Advantages of OOP:**
     - **Modularity:** Classes and objects allow breaking code into more manageable parts.
     - **Reusability:** Code can be reused across the application, leading to faster development cycles.
     - **Maintenance:** Easier to maintain and modify as the application grows.
     - **Data Security:** Attributes can be kept private, and only specific methods can manipulate the data.

   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Steeper learning curve.
     - Can introduce unnecessary complexity for small projects.

3. **PHP and Regular OOP:**
   PHP, a widely-used server-side scripting language, supports both procedural and OOP approaches, making it flexible. In the earlier versions of PHP (before PHP 5), it primarily followed the procedural paradigm, but with PHP 5 and later versions, full OOP support was introduced, making it suitable for modern web applications.

   - **Procedural PHP:**
     Procedural PHP focuses on functions to manipulate data and logic. It's still commonly used for simple websites, legacy systems, or when a quick script is needed. Functions in procedural PHP are not bound to objects, and developers manipulate global variables and use functions directly.

   - **OOP PHP:**
     PHP’s support for OOP includes classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces. OOP in PHP has enabled developers to build more robust, scalable, and maintainable applications, especially with frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter which are all based on OOP principles.

     Example:

     ```php
     class Car {
         public $model;
         public $color;

         // Constructor
         public function __construct($model, $color) {
             $this->model = $model;
             $this->color = $color;
         }

         public function display() {
             echo "This is a " . $this->color . " " . $this->model . " car.";
         }
     }

     $myCar = new Car("Tesla", "Red");
     $myCar->display(); // Output: This is a Red Tesla car.
     ```

**When to Use Procedural vs OOP in PHP:**

- **Procedural:** Best suited for small scripts, one-off tasks, and simpler applications where OOP’s overhead might be overkill.
- **OOP:** Ideal for larger, scalable applications where structure, modularity, and maintainability are priorities, such as building reusable classes and working within a framework.**Procedural OOPs and PHP:**
