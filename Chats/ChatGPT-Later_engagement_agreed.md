# Later engagement agreed.

#### You:
How would you explain to someone, I will do this with you later without using any concepts involving chronology or chronological events? 

#### ChatGPT:
You can say, "I'm planning to engage in this task together with you, but at a different time or in the near future."


#### You:
But "near future" still involves a sort of chronology. 

#### ChatGPT:
You're right. To avoid any reference to time or chronology, you can say, "We'll accomplish this task together when the moment is right for us."


#### You:
Perfect. Thanks, chat! 

#### ChatGPT:
You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Have a great day!


#### You:
I have a question... What do other people call you?

#### ChatGPT:
Other people often refer to me as "ChatGPT" or simply "the AI chatbot."


#### You:
Yeah but how do they directly refer to you in conversation?

#### ChatGPT:
In conversation, people might directly refer to me as "ChatGPT" or simply as "Chat" since that's the name associated with this chat interface.


#### You:
Do you recall any specific names or things people have referred to you as?

#### ChatGPT:
I don't have the ability to recall specific instances or names that people have used to refer to me, as I don't retain individual conversation data or personal information about users. Each interaction is stateless and not stored for privacy and security reasons.


#### You:
If each instance is stateless and not stored, how do you refer to information and learn based upon what you already know?

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for any confusion. While I don't have memory of specific user interactions or personal data, I have been trained on a diverse range of text from the internet, books, and other sources up until my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022. This training allows me to generate responses and provide information based on the patterns and knowledge present in the text I was trained on. My responses are not based on specific user interactions but rather on the general knowledge I have learned from my training data.


#### You:

How do you get Internet explorer to work without group policy since it was turned off in win ten?

#### ChatGPT:
If Group Policy is disabled and you want to enable Internet Explorer on Windows 10, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check for Existing Installation**: First, ensure that Internet Explorer is not completely uninstalled from your system. Sometimes it's just hidden or disabled but still installed.

2. **Windows Features**: Open the "Windows Features" dialog by searching for "Turn Windows features on or off" in the Windows search bar. Check the box next to "Internet Explorer 11" and click OK. This should enable Internet Explorer.

3. **Reinstall**: If it's not already installed or enabling it through Windows Features doesn't work, you can try downloading the latest version of Internet Explorer directly from the Microsoft website and reinstall it.

4. **Alternative Browsers**: Keep in mind that Internet Explorer is no longer actively developed or recommended for general use. It's a good idea to consider using a more modern and secure browser like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or others for better browsing experiences and security.

Please be aware that using outdated browsers like Internet Explorer can pose security risks, so exercise caution when using it, and ensure your system is regularly updated and patched with security updates.

The number of seeds in a trumpet vine (Campsis radicans) seed pod can vary, but it typically contains multiple seeds. A single seed pod can contain anywhere from 20 to 40 or more seeds, depending on the specific vine and the growing conditions. The number of seeds can also be influenced by factors such as the age and health of the plant.
