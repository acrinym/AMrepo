What about the oa? Have they found a new producer yet since Netflix won't run it

#### ChatGPT:
As of now, "The OA" has not found a new producer or platform to continue the series. After Netflix canceled the show in 2019, creators Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij turned down an offer from Netflix to conclude the series with a movie, as they felt it would not do justice to their planned five-season storyline. Despite this, there remains hope among fans and the creators for the show to return under the right circumstances, as they believe in the potential for a revival similar to other shows that have made a comeback after long breaks【23†source】【24†source】.

For now, fans continue to rally for the show's return, and any significant updates will likely come from the creators or potential new production partners.
