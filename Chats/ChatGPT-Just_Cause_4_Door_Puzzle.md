# Just Cause 4 Door Puzzle

#### You:
Okay I need your help with a puzzle and just cause 4. I'm dealing with four console screens that open different doors. If you know the answer I don't want you to tell me it I want to tell you how the different screens interact etc. So they're lined up 1 2 3 4 in a row the first screen makes the last one which is four go up and three goes down the second one makes door two go up and door three go down the third one next door one go up and down and the fourth one also makes door three and or One go down I need to make them all go down

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you're dealing with a puzzle where each screen affects multiple doors, and your goal is to make all the doors go down. Let’s break down how each console affects the doors:

1. **Console 1**: Makes door 4 go up and door 3 go down.
2. **Console 2**: Makes door 2 go up and door 3 go down.
3. **Console 3**: Makes door 1 go up and down.
4. **Console 4**: Makes door 3 and door 1 go down.

### Approach:

We need to figure out an order of interactions that will result in all the doors being down. Let’s go step by step, assuming that initially, all doors are in the "up" position.

1. **Start with Console 4**: This will make both doors 3 and 1 go down.
2. **Next, use Console 2**: This will make door 2 go up, but it will also bring door 3 back down, which is already down from step 1.
3. **Then, use Console 3**: This will bring door 1 back up, so we need to deal with that.
4. **Finally, use Console 1**: This will make door 4 go up and door 3 go down (door 3 is already down from previous steps).

By now, door 4 will be the only door up, so one more use of **Console 1** should bring door 4 down without affecting the others.

### Summary of the steps:

1. Use Console 4 (Doors 1 and 3 down).
2. Use Console 2 (Doors 2 and 3 down, door 1 stays down).
3. Use Console 1 twice to bring door 4 down.

#### You:
I did that but now door one three and four are up

#### ChatGPT:
Got it! Since door 1, 3, and 4 are up after following the previous steps, let’s analyze it again to adjust the sequence.

### What happens when we press each console:

1. **Console 1**: Door 4 goes up, Door 3 goes down.
2. **Console 2**: Door 2 goes up, Door 3 goes down.
3. **Console 3**: Door 1 goes up or down.
4. **Console 4**: Doors 3 and 1 go down.

Right now, **doors 1, 3, and 4 are up**, meaning we need to focus on getting them all down without accidentally raising any others.

### New Plan:

1. **Press Console 3**: This will toggle Door 1, bringing it down (door 1 should now be down).

   Status: **Door 1 is down, doors 3 and 4 are up**.

2. **Press Console 4**: This will bring both Door 1 and Door 3 down (door 1 is already down, so only door 3 changes).

   Status: **Doors 1 and 3 are down, door 4 is still up**.

3. **Press Console 1**: This will bring Door 4 down and Door 3 up (but don’t worry about door 3).

   Status: **Doors 1 and 4 are down, door 3 is up**.

4. **Press Console 4** again: This will toggle Door 3 back down, without affecting Door 1 or Door 4.

   Final Status: **All doors (1, 2, 3, and 4) are now down**.

### Steps:

1. Press Console 3 (door 1 down).
2. Press Console 4 (door 3 down).
3. Press Console 1 (door 4 down).
4. Press Console 4 again (door 3 down).

#### You:
All right now I'm on the USS watchdog and I'm not sure how to destroy these doors that appear to need to be destroyed as a part of critical infrastructure? It doesn't look like I can grapple them closed so is there anything I'm missing

#### ChatGPT:
On the USS Watchdog, you’re likely dealing with large blast doors or structures that are part of the mission's critical objectives. If grappling or interacting with them doesn't seem to work, here are a few things you can try:

1. **Explosives**: Often, critical infrastructure or reinforced doors can be destroyed using **explosives** like C4 (GE-64) or rockets. Make sure you're stocked up on these and try planting them near the doors or firing rockets at them.

2. **Weapons in the Area**: Sometimes there are weapon crates or mounted weapons, like miniguns or missile launchers, specifically placed nearby for these objectives. Look around the ship for anything you can pick up or use.

3. **Environmental Destruction**: In *Just Cause 4*, some doors or barriers are tied to power sources or generators. If you can find power boxes, transformers, or other structural weak points nearby, destroy those and see if it impacts the doors.

4. **Mission Objective Markers**: Make sure you’re following the mission objective markers closely, as sometimes the game will highlight the proper method to destroy something or provide more tools to do so.

5. **Tethering with Force**: If it's not about closing the doors but breaking them open or off, you can use **boosters or tether strength** (using multiple tethers) to pull heavy objects like doors out of place. Try combining multiple tethers, or experiment with mods to increase their strength.

Give these a try and see if any work for you! Let me know how it goes.


#### You:
Well I had to drive a hovercraft in there

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, that makes sense! Sometimes *Just Cause 4* likes to throw in those unexpected solutions where vehicles play a crucial role. Driving the hovercraft must have been part of the mission to destroy or bypass those doors. Glad you figured it out!

If you need any more help or run into more tricky missions, feel free to ask. Keep having fun with the game!


#### You:
Yeah I had to get close to the airlocks which are under the ship that lead to the engine room to even find that out

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like quite the puzzle! *Just Cause 4* can definitely surprise you with how much exploration it requires to figure out certain objectives, especially with hidden access points like those airlocks under the ship. It’s great that you kept at it and found the way forward!

It’s always satisfying when the game’s challenges push you to explore and try new approaches. If you run into any more tricky areas or just want to talk more about the game, feel free to hit me up!
