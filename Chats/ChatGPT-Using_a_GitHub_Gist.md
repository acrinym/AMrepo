# Using a GitHub Gist

#### You:
How do I do this? It says just put it in your browser but that makes no sense to me at all because you can't just pop something in your browser.

#### ChatGPT:
The link you provided is a GitHub Gist, which is essentially a code snippet or file hosted on GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide on what to do with it:

### Option 1: Viewing the Code

1. **Click the link** (or paste it into your browser's address bar and press Enter).
   - This will take you directly to the Gist page on GitHub.
2. **Read the code or content** on the webpage. Gists often contain scripts, configuration files, or instructions.

### Option 2: Downloading the File

1. On the Gist page, look for a **"Download ZIP"** option or a way to copy the raw file.
2. If there's a **"Raw" button**:
   - Click it to see the file content in plain text.
   - Right-click on the page and select **"Save As"** to download the file to your computer.
3. If it's a script (e.g., JavaScript, Python, etc.), you can save it as a file (e.g., `.js`, `.py`, etc.).

### Option 3: Running the Code (If Relevant)

1. If it's a script meant to run in a browser (like JavaScript):
   - Copy the code from the Gist.
   - Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
   - Navigate to the **Console** tab.
   - Paste the code into the console and press Enter.

2. If it's a script meant for the command line:
   - Save the code as a file with the appropriate extension (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.sh` for shell scripts).
   - Run it using the relevant interpreter or shell (e.g., `python script.py` or `bash script.sh`).

#### You:
I'm trying to download my suno files, the songs. 

If you can develop a python code that will allow me to download all my songs in suno, all at once that would be fantastic. I can give you the URL so that you can use the source of the page
https://suno.com/me

#### ChatGPT:
To create a Python script that downloads your songs from Suno, it would require automating browser actions to log in and fetch the files. This process typically involves using a library like `selenium` for web scraping and automation. However, I'll provide you with a sample script outline to get started:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Python** (if you don't already have it).
2. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium requests beautifulsoup4
   ```
3. **Download a WebDriver**:
   - Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) and ensure it's in your system PATH.

### Python Script

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time
import requests
import os

# Configure WebDriver (ensure the driver is installed and in your PATH)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Replace with Firefox(), Edge(), etc., if using another browser

# Suno login page
url = "https://suno.com/me"

# Replace with your login credentials
USERNAME = "your_email@example.com"
PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Create a folder to save the songs
download_folder = "suno_songs"
if not os.path.exists(download_folder):
    os.makedirs(download_folder)

try:
    # Open the Suno page
    driver.get(url)

    # Wait for the page to load
    time.sleep(5)

    # Find and log in (update locators as needed based on Suno's login form)
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "email_input_id").send_keys(USERNAME)  # Replace with the actual email input field ID
    driver.find_element(By.ID, "password_input_id").send_keys(PASSWORD + Keys.RETURN)

    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for login to complete

    # Scrape the links to the songs
    song_links = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "a.download-link")  # Update with the correct selector
    links = [link.get_attribute("href") for link in song_links]

    # Download the songs
    for i, link in enumerate(links):
        response = requests.get(link)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            filename = os.path.join(download_folder, f"song_{i + 1}.mp3")  # Adjust extension if necessary
            with open(filename, "wb") as file:
                file.write(response.content)
            print(f"Downloaded: {filename}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to download: {link}")

finally:
    # Close the browser
    driver.quit()
```

### Steps to Use the Script

1. Replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with your Suno credentials.
2. Update the selectors (`By.ID`, `By.CSS_SELECTOR`) with the correct ones based on the Suno login and download page structure.
   - Use your browser's developer tools (`F12`) to inspect elements and get their IDs or classes.
3. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python download_suno_songs.py
   ```
4. Check the `suno_songs` folder for downloaded songs.

### Notes

- **Terms of Service**: Ensure that downloading songs like this complies with Suno's terms of service.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for login issues, missing elements, or failed downloads.
- **Dynamic Loading**: If songs load dynamically as you scroll, you'll need to automate scrolling using `driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")`.

#### You:
Well, I actually log in with Google. So selenium will have to use my Google login via my Google authenticator etc, I can actually approve the login using my phone. So I'm not sure how I would do that with a headless operation like selenium

#### ChatGPT:
Logging in via Google using Selenium requires automating the OAuth login flow, which includes handling the Google login page. Since you're using Google Authenticator and may need to approve the login on your phone, you'll need to use Selenium in non-headless mode to visually handle these steps. Here's how you can do it:

---

### Updated Python Script for Google Login

#### Prerequisites

1. Follow the **prerequisites** mentioned earlier for installing Python, Selenium, and a WebDriver.
2. Make sure you're using a **non-headless mode** for Selenium since manual approval is required.

---

### Script

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time
import requests
import os

# Configure WebDriver (ensure the driver is installed and in your PATH)
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
# Run in visible mode to handle Google Authenticator
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# Suno login page
url = "https://suno.com/me"

# Folder to save downloaded songs
download_folder = "suno_songs"
if not os.path.exists(download_folder):
    os.makedirs(download_folder)

try:
    # Open the Suno page
    driver.get(url)
    time.sleep(5)  # Allow the page to load

    # Click on "Login with Google" (Update selector if needed)
    google_login_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//button[contains(text(), "Login with Google")]')
    google_login_button.click()

    # Wait for Google login page to load
    time.sleep(5)

    # Fill in Google email
    email_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "identifierId")
    email_field.send_keys("your_email@gmail.com")  # Replace with your email
    email_field.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for password input to load

    # Fill in Google password
    password_field = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password")
    password_field.send_keys("your_password")  # Replace with your password
    password_field.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

    # Wait for phone approval (you'll need to approve on your phone manually)
    print("Approve the login request on your phone...")
    time.sleep(30)  # Wait for manual approval (adjust time as needed)

    # Wait for Suno page to reload after login
    time.sleep(10)

    # Scrape song download links
    song_links = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "a.download-link")  # Update with correct selector
    links = [link.get_attribute("href") for link in song_links]

    # Download songs
    for i, link in enumerate(links):
        response = requests.get(link)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            filename = os.path.join(download_folder, f"song_{i + 1}.mp3")  # Adjust extension if necessary
            with open(filename, "wb") as file:
                file.write(response.content)
            print(f"Downloaded: {filename}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to download: {link}")

finally:
    # Close the browser
    driver.quit()
```

---

### Key Adjustments for Google Login

1. **Manual Approval**: The script includes a `time.sleep(30)` pause to allow you to approve the login on your phone. Adjust the time as needed.
2. **Non-Headless Mode**: The browser window will remain visible so you can interact with the Google login page.
3. **Replace Credentials**: Replace `"your_email@gmail.com"` and `"your_password"` with your actual Google login credentials.
   - Alternatively, skip entering credentials if your Google login is already saved in the browser.

---

### Steps to Run

1. Save the script as `download_suno_songs.py`.
2. Run it:
   ```bash
   python download_suno_songs.py
   ```
3. Approve the login on your phone when prompted.
4. The songs will be downloaded to the `suno_songs` folder.

---

### Notes

- **Saved Sessions**: If you use ChromeDriver with an existing Chrome profile, you can avoid re-entering credentials:
  ```python
  options.add_argument("user-data-dir=/path/to/your/chrome/profile")
  ```
  Replace `/path/to/your/chrome/profile` with your Chrome profile directory.
- **Headless Mode**: After logging in once and saving cookies, you could adapt this to headless mode by loading cookies into the session.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for unexpected pop-ups or elements.
