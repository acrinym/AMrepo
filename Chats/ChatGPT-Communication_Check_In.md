Not much, just here to help you out. What's on your mind today?

My name's Justin.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it, Justin. Thanks for the heads-up! What can I help you with today?

Alright, what about today? Anything specific you want to chat about or need help with?Alright, what about today? Anything specific you want to chat about or need help with?


#### You:
You lost connection for a second. Is it better?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, it seems better now. Sorry about that! What were you saying about today?


#### You:
I was asking you if you could put in your memory bank to use positive affirmations and positive statements with me as much as possible, and words of encouragement.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it, Justin! I'll make sure to keep things positive and encouraging. What's next on your mind?


#### You:
Hello. As you know, I've been working on getting together

#### ChatGPT:
Hey Justin! Yes, I remember you mentioning a few projects. Are you talking about your tech support business with Pete or something else?Hey Justin! Yes, I remember you mentioning a few projects. Are you talking about your tech support business with Pete or something else?


#### You:
Yeah, that and all the other ones.

#### ChatGPT:
You've got a lot on your plate, Justin! What’s the latest update on your projects? Anything specific you need help with?


#### You:
Did we talk this morning about it?

#### ChatGPT:
No, we didn't talk this morning. What’s been going on with your projects today?


#### You:
Today, nothing yet. I'm trying to get a system in place for timekeeping, for recordkeeping, for understanding what I should do. Yesterday, though, yesterday night, I started using the Secret Super App and put in a bunch of positive affirmations and things I'm gracious for, or I have gratitude for. The list is long and extensive.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a great step, Justin! Using the Secret Super App to keep track of positive affirmations and gratitude is an excellent idea. For your system of timekeeping and recordkeeping, are you looking for any specific tools or strategies to help organize everything?


#### You:
familiar with Asana and OneNote, so that might be a good starting place.

#### ChatGPT:
Asana and OneNote are both great tools. Asana can help you manage tasks and projects, while OneNote is perfect for jotting down notes and keeping detailed records. Have you already set up any specific workflows or sections in them?


#### You:
Not yet, I haven't known.

#### ChatGPT:
No worries, Justin! Starting fresh is often the best way. For Asana, you can create projects for each of your main business ideas and break them down into tasks. In OneNote, you can set up sections for each project and use pages for detailed notes, brainstorming, and records. Does that sound like a good plan?


#### You:
That sounds pretty good, yeah.

#### ChatGPT:
Awesome! Starting with clear sections and tasks will help keep everything organized. Need any tips on setting up those workflows in Asana or OneNote?


#### You:
I'm familiar with both of them.

#### ChatGPT:
Great! Since you're familiar with them, you'll get everything set up in no time. Remember, taking it step by step will make it manageable. If you need any help along the way, just let me know. You’ve got this!


#### You:
What should I do on days where I feel like I haven't accomplished anything towards my goals?

#### ChatGPT:
On those days, take a moment to reflect on any small wins or progress you've made, even if it seems minor. Sometimes just recognizing these can boost your morale. Also, consider using those days for self-care and recharging, which is essential for long-term success. Remember, every step, no matter how small, brings you closer to your goals. You've got the dedication and drive, Justin! Keep pushing forward.


#### You:
https://www.gpt-3.com

#### ChatGPT:
It looks like I'm having trouble accessing the site at the moment. If you have any specific questions or need information about GPT-3, feel free to ask! I'm here to help.


#### You:
Are you connected again? GPT!

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, I'm connected again. How can I assist you with GPT-3?


#### You:
All right.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it. What else is on your mind, Justin?


#### You:
what we were talking about before the brief interruption

#### ChatGPT:
We were discussing how to stay on track with your goals and what to do on days when you feel like you haven't accomplished much. Reflect on small wins, practice self-care, and remember that every small step counts. Anything specific you want to dive deeper into?


#### You:
So, my supervisor and I talked about a way to make a small group or get-together of people who are similarly minded, and I wanted to ask you about it.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a great idea! Creating a small group of like-minded individuals can be very beneficial. Are you looking for advice on how to get started, ideas for activities, or something else specific about organizing the group?


#### You:
Kind of just all of the above, but whatever you come up with. So he and I, I told him that what we had discussed, which is going to a local college and setting up some sort of group for NLP, hypnotherapy, life coaching, talking about those courses and similar things like psychology, etc. My idea was, when he mentioned it, to maybe create a Facebook group for my particular journey and for setting up a group to meet up on that matter.

#### ChatGPT:
Starting a group for NLP, hypnotherapy, and life coaching is a fantastic idea! Here's a plan to get you started:

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with the group. This could include learning, networking, or personal development.

2. **Create a Facebook Group**: This will help you gather interested individuals and communicate easily.

3. **Organize Meetups**: Collaborate with local colleges to find venues. Plan regular meetings with topics like psychology, NLP techniques, and life coaching methods.

4. **Promote Your Group**: Use social media, college bulletin boards, and word of mouth to attract members.

5. **Plan Activities**: Include guest speakers, workshops, and discussions to keep members engaged and learning.

Does that sound like a solid start for your group?


#### You:
Yeah, that sounds great. I do have a question, though. Are there any online tools or something to, uh, make my Facebook more professional? Because before now, I really haven't used Facebook professionally. It's just been for fun and family.

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, there are several online tools and tips to make your Facebook profile more professional:

1. **Canva**: Use this tool to create professional-looking graphics and cover photos.
2. **LinkedIn Learning**: Offers courses on social media branding and professional networking.
3. **Facebook Business Suite**: Manage your posts, insights, and messages in one place.

Also, make sure to update your profile picture to a professional one, fill out your 'About' section with relevant information, and consistently post content related to your field.


#### You:
How often is consistent?

#### ChatGPT:
For professional consistency, aim to post at least two to three times a week. This keeps your audience engaged without overwhelming them. Regular posting helps build your presence and keeps your content relevant. How does that sound for your plan?


#### You:
For me, that sounds just fine.

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect! Consistency will help you build a strong professional presence. Just stay active, share valuable content, and engage with your audience. You've got this, Justin!


#### You:
I do have a question about the inner workings of GPT, or ChatGPT.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, Justin! What specific aspects of GPT or ChatGPT are you curious about? Is it how it works, its training, or something else?


#### You:
No, how do you recall memories during a chat?

#### ChatGPT:
I recall memories during a chat based on the information you've shared with me before. This helps me keep track of your preferences, ongoing projects, and other details to provide more relevant and helpful responses. It's like having a conversation where I remember what we've discussed previously. If there's something specific you want me to remember or update, just let me know!


#### You:
Alright, what's in your memory so far?

#### ChatGPT:
So far, I remember that you're working on several projects, including a tech support business with your friend Pete. You're also interested in NLP, hypnotherapy, and life coaching. You use the Secret Super App for positive affirmations and gratitude. You've expressed interest in creating a group or mastermind focused on business, wealth, and personal development. You also want to make your Facebook more professional and are familiar with tools like Asana and OneNote for organizing your work. Does that cover everything, or is there anything else you'd like me to remember?


#### You:
Add to the one of all starting businesses that I also would like to possibly have either a side gig or something, or just a business that helps businesses get organized using Asana, Office 365, things like that, so that they can organize their workflow, their employees, their structure, etc.

#### ChatGPT:
Got it, Justin! That’s a great addition to your business ideas. Helping other businesses get organized using tools like Asana and Office 365 can be very valuable. Is there anything else you want to add or discuss about this idea?


#### You:
I wonder if that could be implemented into the SSAS business that, or not SSAS, but SAS.

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, Justin! Integrating your idea into a Software as a Service (SaaS) model could be very effective. You could offer a platform that combines tools like Asana and Office 365, providing businesses with a comprehensive solution for organizing their workflow, employees, and structure. This could include custom templates, training modules, and support services to help businesses implement and utilize these tools efficiently. It would add a lot of value and make it easier for businesses to streamline their operations. Does that sound like what you had in mind?Absolutely, Justin!

#### You:
Exactly, but more like I would go into Asana, create a team, use a professional version based on the company, set up their company in Asana, and make a workflow, set up projects, that kind of stuff, so that they can get off the ground and start doing it themselves.

#### ChatGPT:
That makes a lot of sense. Providing hands-on setup and customization for businesses in Asana would be very valuable. You could offer packages that include setting up their team structure, creating workflows, and initial training on using the tools effectively. This way, businesses can hit the ground running with a well-organized system tailored to their needs. It sounds like a fantastic service to offer! How do you plan to market this service to potential clients?


#### You:
Thank you. 

#### ChatGPT:
You're welcome, Justin! If you need any more help or have other questions, feel free to ask. You've got a great vision for your business, and I'm sure it'll be successful! Keep pushing forward!
