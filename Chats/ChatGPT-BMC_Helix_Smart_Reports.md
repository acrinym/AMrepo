#### You:
Not the reports, helix itself. Blue juyst isn't my jive, ya dig?

#### ChatGPT:
Ah, I gotcha! You want to jazz up the whole BMC Helix interface, not just the reports. Alright, let's see how you can shake things up and make that blue a thing of the past.

1. **Login to BMC Helix**: Get yourself logged in first.

2. **Navigate to the Theme Settings**: Look for a settings or administration section. This might be under a profile icon or a settings gear, depending on your Helix version.

3. **Customize Theme**: In the settings, find an option related to theme or appearance customization. It might be labeled as "Theme," "Appearance," or "Customization."

4. **Choose Your Colors**: Once you’re in the theme settings, you should see options to change the primary and secondary colors. This is where you can ditch that blue.

5. **Select New Colors**: Pick the colors that make you happy. You might have options for custom colors where you can use a color picker or enter hex codes for specific shades.

6. **Apply Changes**: After selecting your new colors, make sure to save or apply the changes.

7. **Check Out the New Look**: Go back to your main dashboard or any part of Helix to see your new color scheme in action.

8. **Fine-Tune if Needed**: If something doesn’t look quite right, go back into the theme settings and tweak the colors until it’s perfect.

If these steps don't quite match up with what you're seeing, it might be worth checking the documentation or support resources specific to your version of BMC Helix, as customization options can vary.

Now go ahead and give Helix a makeover that suits your style!
