# Adjust Authentication Settings

#### You:
In ZorinOS how do I get linux to stop asking me to authenticate constantly? I am the only admin and only user of the computer, so there are NO OTHER users. 

#### ChatGPT:
In Zorin OS, and many other Linux distributions, the system frequently prompts for authentication to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive system settings. However, if you are the sole user and administrator of the system and find these prompts too frequent, you can adjust the policy to reduce the authentication requests. Keep in mind that this involves some level of security trade-off.

Here's how you can configure this in Zorin OS:

### Method 1: Using Polkit Configuration Editor

1. Open a terminal window. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or searching for "Terminal" in the applications menu.

2. Install the `dconf-editor` package (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install dconf-editor
   ```

3. Open the Dconf Editor:
   ```bash
   dconf-editor
   ```

4. In the Dconf Editor, navigate to `org -> polkit -> desktop -> polkit -> prompt`.

5. Change the `authentication-mode` from `auth_admin` to `auth_self`.

This will reduce the frequency of authentication prompts. However, it is important to note that modifying these settings may pose a security risk, as it allows potentially risky actions to be performed without proper authentication.

### Method 2: Modify sudoers file

1. Open a terminal.

2. Edit the sudoers file using the visudo command:
   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

3. Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing `<username>` with your actual username:

   ```bash
   <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   For example, if your username is "john," the line would be:

   ```bash
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

4. Save and exit the editor.

Keep in mind that modifying the sudoers file can have security implications, and it's important to exercise caution when making changes.

After applying these changes, you should experience fewer authentication prompts. However, be aware that reducing security measures should be done with caution, as it increases the risk of unauthorized access or unintended system changes.

What's 70 - 235

#### ChatGPT:
To calculate the difference between 70 and 235, you subtract 235 from 70:

$$70 - 235 = -165$$

So, the result is -165.
