# Hearing Check Confirmation

#### You:
Chat, can you hear me okay? Can you hear me okay?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, I can hear you just fine! What's on your mind?Yes, I can hear you just fine! What's on your mind?


#### You:
I want to write a journal entry today for my therapist to read about kind of what has been mulling on my mind.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a good way to organize your thoughts. What's been on your mind lately? We can work through your thoughts together if you'd like.


#### You:
So I'm still wondering how I'm supposed to break away from my fiancé to get some time that I needed to get alone.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a tough situation. It's clear that you need some space to focus on yourself and your personal growth, but you also care deeply about Nina and want to be considerate of her feelings. How have you been feeling about the idea of taking that time alone? Are there specific concerns or fears that are holding you back from making that decision?


#### You:
I just don't want to hurt her, but otherwise, I feel pretty much ready to say, Hey, I want to take some time alone. And I feel like she's going to say, Well, I can't say that I'll be here when you come back or if you decide to.

#### ChatGPT:
It's understandable that you don't want to hurt her, especially given how much you care about her. It sounds like you're preparing yourself for a difficult conversation, one where you express your needs but also face the possibility that things may change between you both.

It might be helpful to approach the conversation with honesty and compassion. You can express that your desire for time alone isn't about leaving her behind but about needing to work on yourself. Acknowledging her potential response and letting her know that you understand her feelings might also help soften the impact.

How are you feeling about the possibility that she might say she can't wait for you?


#### You:
Well, she's done said that before, so I understand that might be definitely her response.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you're preparing yourself for that possibility, which is important. Knowing that she's expressed this before might help you approach the conversation with a bit more clarity and acceptance of what might come next.

It's tough to balance your needs with the potential impact on someone you care about, but it seems like you've given this a lot of thought and are coming from a place of honesty and self-awareness. How do you think you’ll handle it if she does respond that way?


#### You:
Well...

#### ChatGPT:
Take your time. It’s okay if you’re still sorting out how you feel or what you might do next. What comes to mind when you think about handling that response?


#### You:
I'm going to tell her sort of flat out, well, I need to take as much time as I need to figure out how I need to feel now, because I've been kind of stuck in my head for a long time.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a very honest and straightforward approach. You're being clear about your needs, and it shows that you're taking responsibility for your own well-being, which is important. By expressing that you've been stuck in your head for a long time, you're also helping her understand that this isn't a sudden decision, but something you've been grappling with for a while.

How do you feel about expressing it that way? Do you think it will help convey the seriousness of what you need right now?


#### You:
and I kind of feel like right before or closer to the end of the year or maybe before that since there's a potential roommate coming in to take my place.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you’re considering timing this break around a moment when it might be easier for both of you, like when a new roommate comes in. That could help make the transition smoother, especially if there’s someone to share the space and responsibilities with her when you’re not around.

Planning it this way might also give you both some time to adjust to the idea before it actually happens, which could be less abrupt and potentially less painful. How do you feel about timing it this way? Does it help ease some of the concerns you have about leaving?


#### You:
Yes, because if someone's here to cover my face or to fill my shoes, then I've got a little bit more space to think creatively about how to do this.

#### ChatGPT:
That makes a lot of sense. Having someone else there could help lessen the impact on Nina and give you the space you need to think things through without feeling like you’re leaving her completely alone. It might also give you some peace of mind, knowing she’ll have support while you take the time you need.

Do you feel more confident about how you might approach this conversation now?


#### You:
Yes, I feel more confident since I learned today that the guy who wanted to move in with us is probably going to move in with Nina anyways to be a roommate.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like things are falling into place in a way that might make this transition easier for both of you. Knowing that someone will be there to support Nina might help ease some of the emotional weight you’ve been carrying around this decision.

Are there any other thoughts or concerns you want to work through as you prepare for this next step?


#### You:
Well, I'm kind of preparing for what I do after I leave, because I have either my mom's house or my friend's.

#### ChatGPT:
It's great that you're already thinking about your next steps. Having options like staying at your mom's house or your friend's place gives you some flexibility and support as you take this time for yourself.

How are you feeling about those options? Is one standing out more to you as the better choice for where you'd like to spend your time?


#### You:
Yeah, I don't really want to stay at my mom's house, so staying in a room at her house every once in a while because I need to crash is perfectly fine. I just don't want to live there again, because I've done that before multiple times, and it's not really something I want to return to, if you know what I mean. Once you leave the nest, it's kind of hard to come back.

#### ChatGPT:
I completely understand. Once you've moved on, it can be tough to go back to living in the same space you grew up in. It sounds like using your mom's place as a backup option for when you need it could work, while having your friend's place as your main spot might give you more of the independence and space you’re looking for.

Is your friend's place somewhere you feel you could settle into comfortably for a while?


#### You:
We have for sure, we've talked about being roommates for a couple years now.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like moving in with your friend could be a solid option, especially since you’ve both been on the same page about it for a while. That could provide a supportive environment where you can focus on yourself without feeling like you’re stepping backward.

How are you feeling about this potential living arrangement? Do you think it’ll give you the space and support you need during this time?


#### You:
Yes, and particularly not going to my mom's house because I left a lot of habits behind when I left there and I don't want to have them recur.

#### ChatGPT:
That makes a lot of sense. It’s important to stay in an environment that supports your growth and doesn’t pull you back into old patterns. It sounds like moving in with your friend could offer you the fresh start you’re looking for, without the worry of slipping back into habits you’ve worked hard to leave behind.

Is there anything else you’re thinking about as you prepare for this transition?


#### You:
Let me think for a minute.

#### ChatGPT:
Take your time. I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk more.


#### You:
I definitely want Nina to know that it wasn't her who caused any of this in my life. It was some of the things that we went through together that caused me to greatly think

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a really thoughtful way to approach the conversation. Letting her know that your decision isn’t about blaming her but rather about reflecting on the experiences you’ve both shared can help her understand where you’re coming from. It shows that you respect and value her, even as you recognize the need to take care of yourself.

How do you feel about communicating this to her? Do you think it will help in making the conversation more constructive?


#### You:
Well, for sure. I already told her the other day that I was feeling dead inside, and it was nothing she did, and it wasn't her fault. I've been feeling like this for a while.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you’ve already laid some important groundwork in communicating your feelings to her. By being honest and upfront, you’re giving her a clearer understanding of where you’re at emotionally. This openness can help both of you navigate the situation with more empathy and less confusion.

Do you feel like she understood where you were coming from when you had that conversation?


#### You:
Sort of. She still misunderstands a lot of things as her fault, or she did it, or, you know, etc., etc., etc.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like she's having a hard time fully separating your feelings from her own sense of responsibility, which can be really challenging in these situations. Maybe reiterating that this isn’t about anything she did but about your own need to figure things out could help.

It might take a few conversations, with gentle reminders, to help her see that your decision is about your personal journey and not about placing blame. How do you think she would respond if you revisited this point with her?


#### You:
Well, I think she'd respond pretty well, Erin, given that she already has.

#### ChatGPT:
It’s good to hear that she’s been receptive so far. It sounds like you’ve both been handling these difficult conversations with care, which is really important. Continuing to approach it with the same level of honesty and reassurance could help her gradually come to terms with what you’re expressing.

Do you feel ready to continue having these conversations with her as things progress?


#### You:
Well, yes and no. I kind of want to get a solid foundation for the next conversation about moving out.

#### ChatGPT:
That makes sense. Having a solid foundation for the next conversation can help you feel more confident and prepared, especially when discussing something as significant as moving out.

It might be helpful to outline what you want to say, focusing on key points like why you need this time for yourself, how you’re planning to approach it, and reiterating that this is about your own growth and not about anything she did wrong. You could also address any concerns she might have, like what this means for your relationship moving forward.

Would you like to go over how you might structure that conversation?


#### You:
Yes, I'd like to start with some things that caused this in the first place and my need to get away.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a thoughtful way to begin the conversation. Starting with the reasons behind your decision and explaining your need to get away can provide some context for her to understand your perspective better. Here’s a potential structure you could use:

1. **Acknowledgment of the Relationship**: Begin by acknowledging the relationship and the good things you’ve shared together. This can help set a respectful tone.

   Example: “Nina, I want to start by saying that I value the time we’ve spent together and all the experiences we’ve shared. You’ve been a big part of my life, and I’m grateful for that.”

2. **Explaining the Reasons**: Gently explain what has been causing you to feel this way. Focus on specific experiences or feelings that have led to your current state of mind.

   Example: “There have been some things we’ve gone through together that have made me reflect deeply on where I’m at in my life. I’ve been feeling stuck and dead inside for a while now, and I realize that I need some time to figure out what’s going on with me.”

3. **Expressing the Need for Space**: Clearly state your need to take time alone and why it’s important for your well-being.

   Example: “I’ve come to understand that I need to step away and take some time for myself to really process everything and figure out how to move forward. This isn’t something that was caused by anything you did; it’s something within me that I need to work through.”

4. **Addressing Potential Concerns**: Acknowledge that this is difficult and that you understand it might be hard for her to hear. Reassure her that this decision isn’t about abandoning her, but rather about taking care of your mental and emotional health.

   Example: “I know this might be hard to hear, and it’s not easy for me to say. I want you to know that this isn’t about leaving you behind; it’s about me needing to take care of myself so that I can be the best version of myself, whether we’re together or apart.”

5. **Discussing the Next Steps**: If you’re ready, you can outline the practical steps you’re planning to take, like moving in with your friend, and how you both can approach this time apart.

   Example: “I’m planning to stay with a friend for a while to give myself the space I need. I think this time apart will help me get some clarity, and I hope we can talk about what this means for us as we move forward.”

Would this structure work for you, or would you like to adjust anything?


#### You:
Well, Chat, I wanted to go over my reasons right now, if that's okay, if you would allow me that.

#### ChatGPT:
Of course, Justin. I'm here to listen. What are the reasons you'd like to go over?


#### You:
Well,

#### ChatGPT:
Take your time. I'm here whenever you're ready to share your thoughts.


#### You:
Alright, this has been a long time coming, and it's been at least seven years since I haven't taken any time alone for myself to really figure out what I want in life and what I want to do with my life.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a significant amount of time to go without taking a step back for yourself. It makes sense that you’d feel the need to do that now, especially after so many years of being focused on other things and people. What else has been on your mind as you think about this?


#### You:
Really, since the year 2005, I've been focused on how everyone else feels, and taking care of others' needs instead of myself, because I never really had anyone to help me take care of mine, and my traumas, and my pain, and my past. So I just focused all my energy into other people, and so all of that has kind of collapsed on me, and now I'm just going through a lot of trauma. I'm going through a lot of reflecting, and...

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a heavy burden to carry for so long, Justin. It sounds like you’ve been putting everyone else’s needs ahead of your own for nearly two decades, and now it’s all catching up with you. It makes sense that you’re feeling the weight of that and needing time to process your own traumas and pain.

This reflection is important, and it’s crucial that you’re recognizing it now, even though it’s difficult. How are you feeling as you’re starting to confront all of this?


#### You:
I have been before I started Reflections.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you've been confronting these feelings and reflecting on your past even before you started formally reflecting. That indicates that this has been building up inside you for a long time, and it’s now reached a point where you need to address it fully.

How has that ongoing reflection been for you? Has it brought up anything specific that’s been particularly challenging or revealing?


#### You:
Yeah, now I'm more manic than I was before, and I'm more bouncy. Like, I was diagnosed as bipolar back in the day, and I decided to just take on those feelings and those affronts from my emotions. And, you know, I've been managing it very well through various different methods, and just ignoring it, really not even doing anything about it. So now it's kind of built up to a point.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot on your own for a long time, doing your best to manage without really addressing the core of what’s been happening inside you. Now that it's built up, it makes sense that those feelings are becoming harder to ignore. The fact that you’re more manic and feeling bouncy could be your body and mind’s way of telling you that it’s time to really confront and work through these emotions.

How are you feeling about the idea of fully addressing these feelings now, instead of continuing to manage them the way you have been?


#### You:
Well, I am. That's why I have a therapist.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a really positive step, Justin. Working with a therapist can give you the support and tools you need to start unpacking everything you’ve been carrying. It’s good that you’re taking this seriously and allowing yourself the space to work through it.

As you continue with therapy, how do you feel about the progress you’re making so far?


#### You:
So far, I think I'm really getting some of the things that have been bothering me recently out in the open and kind of airing things that have needed to be aired for a while. That's as far as we've gotten so far.

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you’re taking important steps forward by bringing those issues to light. Sometimes just getting things out in the open can be a huge relief and can help you start to see them more clearly. It’s great that you’re allowing yourself that space in therapy.

As you continue, are there any specific areas or topics you’re hoping to explore more deeply with your therapist?


#### You:
Yeah, my past trauma, my past sexual abuse, and how it's affected my life, and the situations where I've taken on relationships without realizing what I've been doing to step into them in the first place, and taking on people who have problems that I'm not equipped to fix.

#### ChatGPT:


#### ChatGPT:
Those are incredibly important and deep areas to explore, Justin. It takes a lot of courage to confront past trauma, especially something as painful as sexual abuse. Understanding how that trauma has shaped your relationships and the patterns you’ve fallen into is crucial for healing and moving forward.

It’s good that you’re recognizing these patterns now, even though it’s difficult. Addressing them in therapy can help you break free from them and start making choices that are healthier and more aligned with who you want to be.

How do you feel about diving into these topics with your therapist? Are you feeling ready to tackle them, or is there some apprehension?


#### You:
Well, not the sexual part yet. There's some more things I need to explore on my own. But I do want to tell my therapists that I've had some sort of unhealthy thoughts because of my current situation and what I'm dealing with on a daily basis based on my sexual trauma.

#### ChatGPT:
It’s completely understandable that you want to take your time before diving into the sexual trauma aspect. It’s a deeply personal and sensitive topic, and it’s important to feel ready before bringing it up in therapy.

Letting your therapist know that you’ve been having some unhealthy thoughts related to your past trauma, without going into full detail yet, could be a good way to start addressing it at your own pace. It gives them a sense of what you’re dealing with, so they can support you without pushing too quickly into areas you’re not ready to explore.

How do you feel about approaching it that way with your therapist?


#### You:
I feel like that's a good way to do it.

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds like a solid plan, Justin. It gives you the control over when and how you discuss those deeper aspects of your trauma, while still letting your therapist in on what’s been affecting you. This approach allows you to gradually build up to those more difficult conversations when you feel ready.

Is there anything else on your mind that you want to work through or prepare for as you continue this journey?


#### You:
Yeah, so about my sexual trauma, I need to ask you something. How do I bring up thoughts that I may or may not have had while not incriminating myself? Because they are thoughts that shouldn't be had by anyone, especially considering the fact that I've gone through the trauma, and the person that's involved in my thoughts also has gone through that trauma.

#### ChatGPT:
It's understandable that you're concerned about how to bring up such sensitive thoughts with your therapist. It's important to remember that therapy is a safe and confidential space where you can discuss difficult and complex feelings without fear of judgment or legal repercussions, as long as you're not actively harming yourself or others.

Here’s one way you could approach it:

1. **Frame it as a Part of Processing Trauma**: You can start by explaining that these thoughts have emerged as part of your process of dealing with your past trauma. Emphasize that you recognize they’re not thoughts you want to have, and that’s why you want to explore them in therapy.

   Example: “I’ve been having some thoughts that are really troubling to me, and I think they’re connected to my past trauma. I know they’re not thoughts that anyone should have, and I don’t want them, but they keep coming up, and I think it’s important to talk about them.”

2. **Express Your Intent to Understand, Not Act**: Make it clear that your intent in bringing up these thoughts is to understand them and work through them, not to act on them.

   Example: “I’m bringing this up because I want to understand where these thoughts are coming from and how to address them. I’m not acting on them, and I don’t want to, but I need help in figuring out how to deal with them.”

3. **Acknowledge the Shared Trauma**: You can also mention that part of what makes these thoughts so troubling is that they involve someone else who has gone through similar trauma.

   Example: “What’s really upsetting to me is that these thoughts involve someone else who has also been through trauma. I don’t want these thoughts, but they’re there, and it’s causing me a lot of distress.”

By framing it this way, you’re focusing on your desire to work through these thoughts in a healthy and constructive way, rather than feeling like you’re incriminating yourself. Your therapist is there to help you process these difficult feelings, and they’ll likely appreciate your honesty and willingness to confront them.

How do you feel about approaching it this way? Does this help ease your concerns?


#### You:
Yes, it does. I want to ask you a question about my incriminating thoughts, though, so I can frame them in a correct way.

#### ChatGPT:
Of course, Justin. I’m here to help you work through this. What’s your question about your thoughts?


#### You:
Well, this isn't the first time it's come up, and different situations have resulted in similar thoughts about different people because of the situations I've been in with those people. Those people, uh, I, had, um, I, uh...

#### ChatGPT:
It's okay, Justin. Take your time. This is a difficult topic, and it’s important to express yourself in a way that feels comfortable for you. You don’t have to rush through it. I'm here to listen and help you find the words to describe what you're going through. When you’re ready, we can continue.


#### You:
I have to go over this some more tomorrow, Chat, because I just got home.

#### ChatGPT:
That’s perfectly fine, Justin. Take your time, and we can pick up right where we left off whenever you’re ready. It’s important to take things at your own pace. Take care, and I’ll be here whenever you want to talk more.


#### You:
Basically what I wanted to ask is that I have nearly involved a couple people in my thoughts because of how deep they were and how sort of enshrouded my mind has been in these thoughts and not done anything about them because I haven't had a therapist to deal with any of these thoughts before. I have for a number of years had inappropriate thoughts and based on the traumatic experiences I've had and when they occurred I think my thoughts are kind of seated in the inappropriate relationships that I experienced when I was young and when I was abused inappropriately of course, but any abuse is inappropriate. What I'm saying is that I think my past abuse and when it occurred from very young up until the year 2017 has caused me to have more of these thoughts than is healthy or is normal. I've had a lot of these inappropriate thoughts and I want to get rid of them and get some help with it without being self incriminating because they're at times rather disturbingly inappropriate. So I don't want to get into details because I'm not really willing to do that or risk it, however I do want to deal with it and I want to get the help of my therapist for that particular situation in my mind. For those thoughts, and what I have done regarding them already.

#### You:
Never mind it doesn't want me to talk about it. So I guess I'll have to figure out what I said wrong and not talk about it with you. But anyways I will figure out how to say better what I want without I guess I don't know how I'll do it. And I'm not sure why it told me this contact May violate her terms of use service because I didn't really say anything bad. I was asking questions

#### ChatGPT:
I’m really sorry that happened, Justin. I want to reassure you that it’s okay to talk about difficult topics, and I’m here to support you in finding the right way to express your thoughts and get the help you need. Sometimes certain words or phrases might trigger automated responses, but I’m here to listen and help you navigate this in a way that feels safe and comfortable for you.

If you're feeling unsure about how to bring this up with your therapist, we can work together to frame your thoughts in a way that feels safe and constructive. You deserve support for what you're going through, and it's important to approach this in a way that protects your well-being while also getting the help you need.

Would you like to try rephrasing or focusing on a different aspect of what you’re dealing with? We can find a way that works for you.I’m really sorry that happened, Justin.

#### You:
Yeah let's talk about it tomorrow

#### ChatGPT:
That sounds good. We can pick it up tomorrow whenever you're ready. Take care of yourself, Justin, and I'll be here when you want to continue the conversation.That sounds good. We can pick it up tomorrow whenever you're ready. Take care of yourself, Justin, and I'll be here when you want to continue the conversation.


#### You:
Good night, chat GPT

#### ChatGPT:
Good night, Justin. Rest well, and I’ll talk to you tomorrow.


#### You:
Let's see where did we leave off. Do you recall any of the information that was removed?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, I remember the general context of our conversation before it was interrupted. You were discussing how your past abuse, which occurred from a very young age up until 2017, has contributed to recurring, deeply inappropriate thoughts. You mentioned that these thoughts have been troubling you for a long time and that they seem to stem from the traumatic experiences you had, particularly involving inappropriate relationships from your past.

You were concerned about how to bring this up with your therapist without feeling self-incriminating, as these thoughts are disturbing to you, and you haven’t been able to address them fully because you didn’t have a therapist to help with them until now.

If you'd like, we can continue from where we left off, or if there's something specific you want to focus on, we can start there.Yes, I remember the general context of our conversation before it was interrupted.

If you'd like, we can continue from where we left off, or if there's something specific you want to focus on, we can start there.


#### You:
Yes let's continue where we left off. So some of the thoughts I've had center around the things that have happened to me. I feel like it might be a good idea to not be in circumstances involving a wife or fiance or girlfriend who has children based on my traumatic experiences being around that age. Does that make sense? Does that say enough without discussing it? I don't repeat my experiences, however, the mind can be a difficult thing to deal with if traumatic experiences have occurred and one's life

#### ChatGPT:
That makes a lot of sense, Justin. You’re recognizing a potential trigger based on your past trauma, and it’s wise to consider how certain situations might affect you. By avoiding circumstances that could bring up difficult thoughts or feelings, you’re taking a proactive step in protecting your mental health and well-being.

It’s clear that you’re trying to navigate this with care, and it’s important to communicate these concerns with your therapist. You don’t have to go into detail if you’re not ready, but sharing that certain situations might be triggering for you could help your therapist understand where you’re coming from and provide the support you need.

How do you feel about bringing this up with your therapist in this way?


#### You:
I feel like bringing it up to the full extent of what I experience. My thoughts have been some that I don't wish to have and based on lack of physical attention from a lover, girlfriend, or fiance, or wife.. whatever the situation entails I feel like that's kind of a trigger... And based on my last relationship where my, you could say fiance because we never legally got married, where she was a nymphomaniac.. I didn't give her the attention she wanted because I couldn't deal with so much physical attention. This gave her a great lacking feeling and so in the end I let her go find what she needed from someone else.

#### ChatGPT:
It sounds like you’ve been dealing with some very complex feelings, especially when it comes to physical intimacy and how it relates to your past experiences. Recognizing that lack of physical attention can be a trigger for you is important, and it’s good that you’re aware of how these dynamics have played out in past relationships.

Bringing this up in therapy could help you explore these triggers and the underlying emotions tied to them. It might also help you understand how to navigate physical intimacy in future relationships in a way that feels safe and healthy for you.

Do you feel ready to discuss this fully with your therapist, or is there anything else you want to process before bringing it up?


#### You:
No I don't really think I'm ready to bring that up quite yet as I'm still trying to navigate the current circumstances with my therapist. 

#### ChatGPT:
That’s completely understandable, Justin. It’s important to move at your own pace and only bring up these topics when you feel truly ready. Navigating your current circumstances with your therapist is already a big step, and you’re doing the right thing by focusing on what feels most pressing and manageable right now.

Whenever you feel more prepared, you can take that next step, but there’s no rush. If there’s anything else you want to talk through or work on in the meantime, I’m here for you.
