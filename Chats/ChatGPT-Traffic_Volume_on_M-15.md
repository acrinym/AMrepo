1. **Compile Evidence**: Gather all texts, emails, and other communication that show your overnight stays with your child.

2. **Organize Chronologically**: Arrange these messages by date to clearly show the timeline of your overnights.

3. **Highlight Key Information**: Identify and highlight messages that specifically mention the dates and duration of overnights.

4. **Summarize Overnights**: Create a summary or a log that lists each overnight with the corresponding date and duration.

5. **Submit to FofC**: Present this organized information to the Friend of the Court when you file your motion for a modification.

If you need help with specific details or crafting the summary, feel free to provide more context, and I can assist with structuring the information.
