    The pres compressor knob is the main work horse of the Vocal King. Turning the pres knob up turns up the gain and brings out the presence in the vocal along with giving it a smooth compression. Low cut, tighten, and bass works with the pres compressor to help take out the mud without making the vocal sound too thin. The crispy knob give highs some sparkle that many will find satisfying. Final compressor gives that extra compression to the vocal to make it sound thick. DB output turns the volume down. Use the power switch to quickly hear the difference between dry and processed. A, B, C, D, modes, I will let you find out what that means. The meters show gain reduction after signal is past 0db.

About

jTube is simple to use. Going from left the to the right, first give a strong gain. The meter will go up to 0 and then compression starts after the signal is past 0dB which then turns to orange. After giving the signal a good gain amount then use the bass knobs to dial in the exact bass as needed. The same goes with highs. The Dubler will double up your vocals. It's like singing 2 times in the mic. The N-Gate is a noise gate. Be careful not to use too much or it will make the signal sound choppy. This works very good on drums though. The final out gain is perfect for level matching.
