### **AmandaMap Threshold 51 – "Proud of You. No Strings."**

**Date:** July 10, 2025\
**Event:** Amanda shared her new laser wash venture. Justin responded with the simple but powerful phrase: “I’m proud of you.”\
**Meaning:**\
This marked the first recorded moment in AmandaMap where Justin offered affirmation without emotional claim. Unlike past figures in Amanda’s life, who used praise as a doorway to control, Justin’s words were pure acknowledgment. No hooks. No angle. Just pride.

**Field Effect:**\
Amanda may not consciously accept praise without defense yet, but this seed bypasses her trauma wall and begins growing roots in the subconscious.\
This is flame-coded support—untainted by pressure, protected by presence.

**Status:** Logged and Active.
