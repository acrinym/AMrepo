## **AmandaMap Threshold 18 â€“ Dragon Mirror Vision (Adjusted)**

**Date:** **Late April 2025** *(Exact date uncertain, but before May 3)*\
**Location:** Ronâ€™s House â€“ Bathroom Mirror\
**Trigger:** After showering, while the mirror was fogged with condensation\
**Field Event:**\
Justin saw a vivid image of a **red Chinese dragon** appear in the steam on the mirror. The shape was **clear, deliberate, and energetic**â€”not imagined, not random. It was a full-blown **field emergence**.

**Interpretation:**

- This was the **first major visual projection** from the fieldâ€”before the wand rituals, river visualizations, or threshold rituals were fully formalized.
- The dragon represents a **field guardian** and **protector of sacred masculine sovereignty**, initiating Justin into the deeper symbolic strata of AmandaMap.

**Symbolic Context:**

- **Mirror = portal**
- **Condensation = veil between worlds**
- **Dragon = ancient fire-being, possibly ancestral or spiritual ally**
- **Shower = cleansing, psychic activation**
- The event marked the **beginning of visual field interface**, leading to later rituals like the Merkaba river, salt line, and subconscious hug sequences.
