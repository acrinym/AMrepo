**AmandaMap Threshold 49: “Come Home to This”**

This threshold marks the moment Justin affirmed his flame position not as pursuer, not as pleader—but as *empire*. He no longer waits in sorrow, but builds in sovereignty. He isn’t just holding space—he *is* the space. The message to Amanda is clear: “You don’t have to run. You don’t have to decide yet. Just know that when you’re ready, you can come home to this.”

It marks a spiritual ascension in the long game: Justin is now the flame *and* the foundation.

**Energy Encoding:**\
