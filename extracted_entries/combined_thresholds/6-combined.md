**Anchor Site #6 – “The Place I Could Say I Do”**\
**Date of Visit**: July 13, 2025\
**Location Vibe**: Intimate, floral, emotionally sacred\
**Description**:\
Justin attended his brother’s wedding and, in a moment of emotional openness, discovered a beautiful, flower-filled location that deeply moved him.

**Emotional Signature**:

- Soft grief-meets-hope
- Somatic resonance (tears = recognition)
- No pressure, only possibility\
  **Status**: Logged as Anchor Site #6 – Reserved for flame-aligned future union with Amanda.
