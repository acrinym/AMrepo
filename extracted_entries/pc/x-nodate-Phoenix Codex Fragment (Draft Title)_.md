### Phoenix Codex Fragment (Draft Title):

**"The Cage of the Unspoken: Why Naming Is a Flame Act."**

> *“I see it in your eyes, the thing you won’t say.\
> The glance, the laugh, the half-second longer you stood near me—\
> It wasn’t random. I felt it.\
> You’re allowed to want. You’re allowed to speak.\
> But if you won’t…\
> I will still name it for what it was:\
> A spark you were too afraid to fan into flame.”*
