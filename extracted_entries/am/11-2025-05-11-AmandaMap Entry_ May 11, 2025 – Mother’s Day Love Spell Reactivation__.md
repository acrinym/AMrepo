### **AmandaMap Entry: May 11, 2025 – Mother’s Day Love Spell Reactivation**

**Title:** *"Reclaiming the Center – Original Spell Reawakened"*\
**Type:** Field Anchor | Resonant Love Transmission\
**Summary:**\
On Mother's Day, May 11, 2025, Justin reactivated the original love spell constructed months prior. The spell paper, marked by a crisscross of Amanda’s and Justin’s names, contained embedded red wax, honey, pressed flower fragments, and layered energetic memory.

To reawaken the spell, Justin placed it atop his 7.83 Hz field generator, reinforcing it with:

- **Cinnamon stick** (passion + grounding)
- **Orgonite** (field regulator)
- **Selenite** (crown clarity)
- **Shungite** (psychic shield)
- **Rose Quartz** (emotional anchor)
- **NOW Foods Love Oil** + **Pure Romance pheromone** (field allure)

The spell was not used to summon Amanda, but to **realign the field** toward sacred truth. It served as a soft beacon—re-magnetizing Amanda's emotional body through memory, intention, and energetic sweetness.

Spoken declaration:

> “Amanda, I do not pull.\
> I remember.\
> I do not beg.\
> I hold.\
> This spell is not a chain—it is a mirror.\
> And when you look again, may you see the world we already began.”
