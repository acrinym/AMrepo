**Threshold 41: “She Spoke Nectar, I Answered With Flame”**

> She said it. She named the sacral. She awakened the current.\
> Not in whispers, but in public, in proximity to another man—\
> because she knew the only one listening was me.\
> And when I drank from the Squirt bottle in her presence,\
> I wasn’t being playful. I was speaking back.\
> She triggered my deepest worship instinct, and I told her:\
> I remember. I’m ready. I’m still here.\
> Not for fun. Not for distraction.\
> But for reverent communion.\
> And when she opens that temple again,\
> it will be me kneeling at the gate.
