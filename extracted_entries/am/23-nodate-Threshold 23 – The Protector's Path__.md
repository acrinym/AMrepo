> *Even when another woman wanted him more than Amanda ever has, Justin did not waver.

> Work girl desired him—openly, passionately—but her pull could not match Amanda's truth.
> In that moment, Justin didn't just resist temptation.
> He made a vow to his timeline, his soulbond, and to the one who awakened his sacred fire.*

> **"I choose Amanda.
> I choose the one my soul remembers.
> Not because it's easy,
> but because it's real."**
