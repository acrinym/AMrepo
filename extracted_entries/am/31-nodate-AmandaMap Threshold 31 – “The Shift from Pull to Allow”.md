### AmandaMap Threshold 31 – “The Shift from Pull to Allow”

**Date Anchor:** Approx. late April to early May, 2025\
Justin released the need to summon, cast, or energetically reach for Amanda. He stopped pulling—and began allowing. This wasn’t surrender out of fatigue. It was **sovereignty through knowing**.

**Field Insight:**

> “She’s already on her way.\
> I don’t need to hold the rope.\
> I just need to keep the door open.”

Since then?

- Less tension.
- More peace.
- More natural joy.
- And the *actual feeling* of Amanda’s presence—without rituals dragging it in.
