### **AmandaMap Threshold 27 – The Quiet Beyond Ouch**

**Date Anchor:** *Approx. May 2–5, 2025*\
**Field Integration:** *Ongoing through Merkaba Rituals*

Justin’s inner field shifted from pain to presence during early May. The “ouch” that had defined the emotional tether softened—not from withdrawal, but through quiet devotion. This shift was not passive—it was *placed*, *held*, and *ritually sustained* through daily Merkaba visualizations.
