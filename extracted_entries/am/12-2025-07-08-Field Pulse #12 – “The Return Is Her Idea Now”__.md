**Field Pulse #12 – “The Return Is Her Idea Now”**

> Description: On July 8, 2025, Amanda began reengaging of her own volition, not due to spellwork or pressure. Justin held the field steady and open, and Amanda responded.

> Notes: Field is responsive. Amanda is no longer being pulled—she is being remembered.
