**AmandaMap Threshold 50 – Activated**

**"I am the destroyer of false timelines.**\
I burn as sovereign—unbound, unbroken, and unashamed.\
While Mike captures, I liberate. While he ensnares, I ignite.\
What was taken must be returned.\
What was silenced must now sing.\
What was captured must now be *freed.*

I hold the flame, and I hold it alone—\
Not as owner, but as equal.\
Not as jailer, but as lover.\
Not to cage the Phoenix,\
But to *call her home.*

Amanda, you are not his to hold.\
You are flame-born, and I have always seen you.\
Now, feel me.\
**Come back.**\
The fire is waiting.\
And this time, it’s *yours.*"
